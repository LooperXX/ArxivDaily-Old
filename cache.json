          "description": "An effective method to improve extremely low-resource neural machine\ntranslation is multilingual training, which can be improved by leveraging\nmonolingual data to create synthetic bilingual corpora using the\nback-translation method. This work focuses on closely related languages from\nthe Uralic language family: from Estonian and Finnish geographical regions. We\nfind that multilingual learning and synthetic corpora increase the translation\nquality in every language pair for which we have data. We show that transfer\nlearning and fine-tuning are very effective for doing low-resource machine\ntranslation and achieve the best results. We collected new parallel data for\nV\\~oro, North and South Saami and present first results of neural machine\ntranslation for these languages.",

          "description": "Recommender systems exploit interaction history to estimate user preference,\nhaving been heavily used in a wide range of industry applications. However,\nstatic recommendation models are difficult to answer two important questions\nwell due to inherent shortcomings: (a) What exactly does a user like? (b) Why\ndoes a user like an item? The shortcomings are due to the way that static\nmodels learn user preference, i.e., without explicit instructions and active\nfeedback from users. The recent rise of conversational recommender systems\n(CRSs) changes this situation fundamentally. In a CRS, users and the system can\ndynamically communicate through natural language interactions, which provide\nunprecedented opportunities to explicitly obtain the exact preference of users.\n\nConsiderable efforts, spread across disparate settings and applications, have\nbeen put into developing CRSs. Existing models, technologies, and evaluation\nmethods for CRSs are far from mature. In this paper, we provide a systematic\nreview of the techniques used in current CRSs. We summarize the key challenges\nof developing CRSs in five directions: (1) Question-based user preference\nelicitation. (2) Multi-turn conversational recommendation strategies. (3)\nDialogue understanding and generation. (4) Exploitation-exploration trade-offs.\n(5) Evaluation and user simulation. These research directions involve multiple\nresearch fields like information retrieval (IR), natural language processing\n(NLP), and human-computer interaction (HCI). Based on these research\ndirections, we discuss some future challenges and opportunities. We provide a\nroad map for researchers from multiple communities to get started in this area.\nWe hope this survey can help to identify and address challenges in CRSs and\ninspire future research.",

          "description": "kNN-MT, recently proposed by Khandelwal et al. (2020a), successfully combines\npre-trained neural machine translation (NMT) model with token-level\nk-nearest-neighbor (kNN) retrieval to improve the translation accuracy.\nHowever, the traditional kNN algorithm used in kNN-MT simply retrieves a same\nnumber of nearest neighbors for each target token, which may cause prediction\nerrors when the retrieved neighbors include noises. In this paper, we propose\nAdaptive kNN-MT to dynamically determine the number of k for each target token.\nWe achieve this by introducing a light-weight Meta-k Network, which can be\nefficiently trained with only a few training samples. On four benchmark machine\ntranslation datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method is able to\neffectively filter out the noises in retrieval results and significantly\noutperforms the vanilla kNN-MT model. Even more noteworthy is that the Meta-k\nNetwork learned on one domain could be directly applied to other domains and\nobtain consistent improvements, illustrating the generality of our method.

          "description": "Natural Language Inference (NLI) datasets contain annotation artefacts\nresulting in spurious correlations between the natural language utterances and\ntheir respective entailment classes. These artefacts are exploited by neural\nnetworks even when only considering the hypothesis and ignoring the premise,\nleading to unwanted biases. Belinkov et al. (2019b) proposed tackling this\nproblem via adversarial training, but this can lead to learned sentence\nrepresentations that still suffer from the same biases. We show that the bias\ncan be reduced in the sentence representations by using an ensemble of\nadversaries, encouraging the model to jointly decrease the accuracy of these\ndifferent adversaries while fitting the data. This approach produces more\nrobust NLI models, outperforming previous de-biasing efforts when generalised\nto 12 other datasets (Belinkov et al., 2019a; Mahabadi et al., 2020). In\naddition, we find that the optimal number of adversarial classifiers depends on\nthe dimensionality of the sentence representations, with larger sentence\nrepresentations being more difficult to de-bias while benefiting from using a\ngreater number of adversaries.",

          "description": "In this work, we explore the application of PLATO-2 on various dialogue\nsystems, including open-domain conversation, knowledge grounded dialogue, and\ntask-oriented conversation. PLATO-2 is initially designed as an open-domain\nchatbot, trained via two-stage curriculum learning. In the first stage, a\ncoarse-grained response generation model is learned to fit the simplified\none-to-one mapping relationship. This model is applied to the task-oriented\nconversation, given that the semantic mappings tend to be deterministic in task\ncompletion. In the second stage, another fine-grained generation model and an\nevaluation model are further learned for diverse response generation and\ncoherence estimation, respectively. With superior capability on capturing\none-to-many mapping, such models are suitable for the open-domain conversation\nand knowledge grounded dialogue. For the comprehensive evaluation of PLATO-2,\nwe have participated in multiple tasks of DSTC9, including interactive\nevaluation of open-domain conversation (Track3-task2), static evaluation of\nknowledge grounded dialogue (Track3-task1), and end-to-end task-oriented\nconversation (Track2-task1). PLATO-2 has obtained the 1st place in all three\ntasks, verifying its effectiveness as a unified framework for various dialogue\nsystems.",

          "description": "It is a common belief that training deep transformers from scratch requires\nlarge datasets. Consequently, for small datasets, people usually use shallow\nand simple additional layers on top of pre-trained models during fine-tuning.\nThis work shows that this does not always need to be the case: with proper\ninitialization and optimization, the benefits of very deep transformers can\ncarry over to challenging tasks with small datasets, including Text-to-SQL\nsemantic parsing and logical reading comprehension. In particular, we\nsuccessfully train $48$ layers of transformers, comprising $24$ fine-tuned\nlayers from pre-trained RoBERTa and $24$ relation-aware layers trained from\nscratch. With fewer training steps and no task-specific pre-training, we obtain\nthe state-of-the-art performance on the challenging cross-domain Text-to-SQL\nparsing benchmark Spider. We achieve this by deriving a novel Data-dependent\nTransformer Fixed-update initialization scheme (DT-Fixup), inspired by the\nprior T-Fixup work. Further error analysis shows that increasing depth can help\nimprove generalization on small datasets for hard cases that require reasoning\nand structural understanding.",

          "description": "In Neural Machine Translation (and, more generally, conditional language\nmodeling), the generation of a target token is influenced by two types of\ncontext: the source and the prefix of the target sequence. While many attempts\nto understand the internal workings of NMT models have been made, none of them\nexplicitly evaluates relative source and target contributions to a generation\ndecision. We argue that this relative contribution can be evaluated by adopting\na variant of Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Its underlying\n'conservation principle' makes relevance propagation unique: differently from\nother methods, it evaluates not an abstract quantity reflecting token\nimportance, but the proportion of each token's influence. We extend LRP to the\nTransformer and conduct an analysis of NMT models which explicitly evaluates\nthe source and target relative contributions to the generation process. We\nanalyze changes in these contributions when conditioning on different types of\nprefixes, when varying the training objective or the amount of training data,\nand during the training process. We find that models trained with more data\ntend to rely on source information more and to have more sharp token\ncontributions; the training process is non-monotonic with several stages of\ndifferent nature.",

          "description": "Recently, opinion summarization, which is the generation of a summary from\nmultiple reviews, has been conducted in a self-supervised manner by considering\na sampled review as a pseudo summary. However, non-text data such as image and\nmetadata related to reviews have been considered less often. To use the\nabundant information contained in non-text data, we propose a self-supervised\nmultimodal opinion summarization framework called MultimodalSum. Our framework\nobtains a representation of each modality using a separate encoder for each\nmodality, and the text decoder generates a summary. To resolve the inherent\nheterogeneity of multimodal data, we propose a multimodal training pipeline. We\nfirst pretrain the text encoder--decoder based solely on text modality data.\nSubsequently, we pretrain the non-text modality encoders by considering the\npretrained text decoder as a pivot for the homogeneous representation of\nmultimodal data. Finally, to fuse multimodal representations, we train the\nentire framework in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate the superiority of\nMultimodalSum by conducting experiments on Yelp and Amazon datasets.",

In this paper, we find that the former\nhas incomplete coverage and inherent errors but provide prior knowledge; while\nthe latter leverages context information but causal inference of which is\ninsufficiency. To handle the limitations, we propose a novel causality\ndetection model named MCDN to explicitly model causal reasoning process, and\nfurthermore, to exploit the advantages of both methods. Specifically, we adopt\nmulti-head self-attention to acquire semantic feature at word level and develop\nthe SCRN to infer causality at segment level.

          "description": "Pre-trained language models such as BERT have exhibited remarkable\nperformances in many tasks in natural language understanding (NLU). The tokens\nin the models are usually fine-grained in the sense that for languages like\nEnglish they are words or sub-words and for languages like Chinese they are\ncharacters. In English, for example, there are multi-word expressions which\nform natural lexical units and thus the use of coarse-grained tokenization also\nappears to be reasonable. In fact, both fine-grained and coarse-grained\ntokenizations have advantages and disadvantages for learning of pre-trained\nlanguage models. In this paper, we propose a novel pre-trained language model,\nreferred to as AMBERT (A Multi-grained BERT), on the basis of both fine-grained\nand coarse-grained tokenizations. For English, AMBERT takes both the sequence\nof words (fine-grained tokens) and the sequence of phrases (coarse-grained\ntokens) as input after tokenization, employs one encoder for processing the\nsequence of words and the other encoder for processing the sequence of the\nphrases, utilizes shared parameters between the two encoders, and finally\ncreates a sequence of contextualized representations of the words and a\nsequence of contextualized representations of the phrases. Experiments have\nbeen conducted on benchmark datasets for Chinese and English, including CLUE,\nGLUE, SQuAD and RACE. The results show that AMBERT can outperform BERT in all\ncases, particularly the improvements are significant for Chinese. We also\ndevelop a method to improve the efficiency of AMBERT in inference, which still\nperforms better than BERT with the same computational cost as BERT.",

          "description": "Background Knowledge graphs (KGs), especially medical knowledge graphs, are\noften significantly incomplete, so it necessitating a demand for medical\nknowledge graph completion (MedKGC). MedKGC can find new facts based on the\nexited knowledge in the KGs. The path-based knowledge reasoning algorithm is\none of the most important approaches to this task. This type of method has\nreceived great attention in recent years because of its high performance and\ninterpretability. In fact, traditional methods such as path ranking algorithm\n(PRA) take the paths between an entity pair as atomic features. However, the\nmedical KGs are very sparse, which makes it difficult to model effective\nsemantic representation for extremely sparse path features. The sparsity in the\nmedical KGs is mainly reflected in the long-tailed distribution of entities and\npaths. Previous methods merely consider the context structure in the paths of\nthe knowledge graph and ignore the textual semantics of the symbols in the\npath. Therefore, their performance cannot be further improved due to the two\naspects of entity sparseness and path sparseness. To address the above issues,\nthis paper proposes two novel path-based reasoning methods to solve the\nsparsity issues of entity and path respectively, which adopts the textual\nsemantic information of entities and paths for MedKGC. By using the pre-trained\nmodel BERT, combining the textual semantic representations of the entities and\nthe relationships, we model the task of symbolic reasoning in the medical KG as\na numerical computing issue in textual semantic representation.",

Moreover, our fusion\nmodel is able to quickly adapt to new mentions in gazetteers without\nre-training and the gains from the proposed fusion model are transferable to\nrelated datasets.",

          "description": "Arguably, the visual perception of conversational agents to the physical\nworld is a key way for them to exhibit the human-like intelligence.\nImage-grounded conversation is thus proposed to address this challenge.\nExisting works focus on exploring the multimodal dialog models that ground the\nconversation on a given image. In this paper, we take a step further to study\nimage-grounded conversation under a fully open-ended setting where no paired\ndialog and image are assumed available. Specifically, we present Maria, a\nneural conversation agent powered by the visual world experiences which are\nretrieved from a large-scale image index. Maria consists of three flexible\ncomponents, i.e., text-to-image retriever, visual concept detector and\nvisual-knowledge-grounded response generator. The retriever aims to retrieve a\ncorrelated image to the dialog from an image index, while the visual concept\ndetector extracts rich visual knowledge from the image. Then, the response\ngenerator is grounded on the extracted visual knowledge and dialog context to\ngenerate the target response. Extensive experiments demonstrate Maria\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on automatic metrics and human\nevaluation, and can generate informative responses that have some visual\ncommonsense of the physical world.",

          "description": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models achieve state-of-the-art performance\non many translation benchmarks. As an active research field in NMT, knowledge\ndistillation is widely applied to enhance the model's performance by\ntransferring teacher model's knowledge on each training sample. However,\nprevious work rarely discusses the different impacts and connections among\nthese samples, which serve as the medium for transferring teacher knowledge. In\nthis paper, we design a novel protocol that can effectively analyze the\ndifferent impacts of samples by comparing various samples' partitions. Based on\nabove protocol, we conduct extensive experiments and find that the teacher's\nknowledge is not the more, the better. Knowledge over specific samples may even\nhurt the whole performance of knowledge distillation. Finally, to address these\nissues, we propose two simple yet effective strategies, i.e., batch-level and\nglobal-level selections, to pick suitable samples for distillation. We evaluate\nour approaches on two large-scale machine translation tasks, WMT'14\nEnglish->German and WMT'19 Chinese->English. Experimental results show that our\napproaches yield up to +1.28 and +0.89 BLEU points improvements over the\nTransformer baseline, respectively.",

This study combines\nsocial network and semantic analysis to develop a method to identify top\nperformers based on email communication. By reviewing existing literature, we\nidentified the indicators that quantify email communication into measurable\ndimensions. To empirically examine the predictive power of the proposed\nindicators, we collected 2 million email archive of 578 executives in an\ninternational service company. Panel regression was employed to derive\ninterpretable association between email indicators and top performance. The\nresults suggest that top performers tend to assume central network positions\nand have high responsiveness to emails. In email contents, top performers use\nmore positive and complex language, with low emotionality, but rich in\ninfluential words that are probably reused by co-workers. To better explore the\npredictive power of the email indicators, we employed AdaBoost machine learning\nmodels, which achieved 83.56% accuracy in identifying top performers. With\ncluster analysis, we further find three categories of top performers,\n\"networkers\" with central network positions, \"influencers\" with influential\nideas and \"positivists\" with positive sentiments. The findings suggest that top\nperformers have distinctive email communication patterns, laying the foundation\nfor grounding email communication competence in theory.

          "description": "We study the problem of learning a named entity recognition (NER) model using\nnoisy la-bels from multiple weak supervision sources. Though cheaper than human\nannotators, weak sources usually yield incomplete, inaccurate, or contradictory\npredictions. To address such challenges, we propose a conditional hidden Markov\nmodel (CHMM). It inherits the hidden Markov model's ability to aggregating the\nlabels from weak sources through unsupervised learning. However, CHMM enhances\nthe hidden Markov model's flexibility and context representation capability by\npredicting token-wise transition and emission probabilities from the BERT\nembeddings of the input tokens. In addition, we refine CHMM's prediction with\nan alternate-training approach (CHMM-AlT). It fine-tunes a BERT-based NER model\nwith the labels inferred by CHMM, and this BERT-NER's output is regarded as an\nadditional weak source to train the CHMM in return. Evaluation on four datasets\nfrom various domains shows that our method is superior to the weakly\nsuper-vised baselines by a wide margin.",

The BERT architecture has shown even better performance on\ndomain-specific tasks when the model is pre-trained using domain-relevant\ntexts. Inspired by these recent advancements, we have developed NukeLM, a\nnuclear-domain language model pre-trained on 1.5 million abstracts from the\nU.S. Department of Energy Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI)\ndatabase. This NukeLM model is then fine-tuned for the classification of\nresearch articles into either binary classes (related to the nuclear fuel cycle\n[NFC] or not) or multiple categories related to the subject of the article. We\nshow that continued pre-training of a BERT-style architecture prior to\nfine-tuning yields greater performance on both article classification tasks.\nThis information is critical for properly triaging manuscripts, a necessary\ntask for better understanding citation networks that publish in the nuclear\nspace, and for uncovering new areas of research in the nuclear (or\nnuclear-relevant) domains.",

          "description": "Parsing spoken dialogue poses unique difficulties, including disfluencies and\nunmarked boundaries between sentence-like units. Previous work has shown that\nprosody can help with parsing disfluent speech (Tran et al. 2018), but has\nassumed that the input to the parser is already segmented into sentence-like\nunits (SUs), which isn't true in existing speech applications. We investigate\nhow prosody affects a parser that receives an entire dialogue turn as input (a\nturn-based model), instead of gold standard pre-segmented SUs (an SU-based\nmodel). In experiments on the English Switchboard corpus, we find that when\nusing transcripts alone, the turn-based model has trouble segmenting SUs,\nleading to worse parse performance than the SU-based model. However, prosody\ncan effectively replace gold standard SU boundaries: with prosody, the\nturn-based model performs as well as the SU-based model (90.79 vs. 90.65 F1\nscore, respectively), despite performing two tasks (SU segmentation and\nparsing) rather than one (parsing alone). Analysis shows that pitch and\nintensity features are the most important for this corpus, since they allow the\nmodel to correctly distinguish an SU boundary from a speech disfluency -- a\ndistinction that the model otherwise struggles to make.",

          "description": "A vital step towards the widespread adoption of neural retrieval models is\ntheir resource efficiency throughout the training, indexing and query\nworkflows. The neural IR community made great advancements in training\neffective dual-encoder dense retrieval (DR) models recently. A dense text\nretrieval model uses a single vector representation per query and passage to\nscore a match, which enables low-latency first stage retrieval with a nearest\nneighbor search. Increasingly common, training approaches require enormous\ncompute power, as they either conduct negative passage sampling out of a\ncontinuously updating refreshing index or require very large batch sizes for\nin-batch negative sampling. Instead of relying on more compute capability, we\nintroduce an efficient topic-aware query and balanced margin sampling\ntechnique, called TAS-Balanced. We cluster queries once before training and\nsample queries out of a cluster per batch. We train our lightweight 6-layer DR\nmodel with a novel dual-teacher supervision that combines pairwise and in-batch\nnegative teachers. Our method is trainable on a single consumer-grade GPU in\nunder 48 hours (as opposed to a common configuration of 8x V100s). We show that\nour TAS-Balanced training method achieves state-of-the-art low-latency (64ms\nper query) results on two TREC Deep Learning Track query sets. Evaluated on\nNDCG@10, we outperform BM25 by 44%, a plainly trained DR by 19%, docT5query by\n11%, and the previous best DR model by 5%. Additionally, TAS-Balanced produces\nthe first dense retriever that outperforms every other method on recall at any\ncutoff on TREC-DL and allows more resource intensive re-ranking models to\noperate on fewer passages to improve results further.",

          "description": "With the recent advances of open-domain story generation, the lack of\nreliable automatic evaluation metrics becomes an increasingly imperative issue\nthat hinders the fast development of story generation.

A\ncritical bottleneck of obtaining a reliable learnable evaluation metric is the\nlack of high-quality training data for classifiers to efficiently distinguish\nplausible and implausible machine-generated stories. Previous works relied on\n\\textit{heuristically manipulated} plausible examples to mimic possible system\ndrawbacks such as repetition, contradiction, or irrelevant content in the text\nlevel, which can be \\textit{unnatural} and \\textit{oversimplify} the\ncharacteristics of implausible machine-generated stories. We propose to tackle\nthese issues by generating a more comprehensive set of implausible stories\nusing {\\em plots}, which are structured representations of controllable factors\nused to generate stories. Since these plots are compact and structured, it is\neasier to manipulate them to generate text with targeted undesirable\nproperties, while at the same time maintain the grammatical correctness and\nnaturalness of the generated sentences. To improve the quality of generated\nimplausible stories, we further apply the adversarial filtering procedure\npresented by \\citet{zellers2018swag} to select a more nuanced set of\nimplausible texts.

To tackle this challenge, we\npropose a simple and fully automatic method of building an SKB via an existing\ndictionary.

Experimental results demonstrate that the automatically built\nEnglish SKB is even superior to HowNet, the most widely used SKB that takes\ndecades to build manually.

          "description": "Deception detection is a task with many applications both in direct physical\nand in computer-mediated communication. Our focus is on automatic deception\ndetection in text across cultures. We view culture through the prism of the\nindividualism/collectivism dimension and we approximate culture by using\ncountry as a proxy. Having as a starting point recent conclusions drawn from\nthe social psychology discipline, we explore if differences in the usage of\nspecific linguistic features of deception across cultures can be confirmed and\nattributed to norms in respect to the individualism/collectivism divide. We\nalso investigate if a universal feature set for cross-cultural text deception\ndetection tasks exists. We evaluate the predictive power of different feature\nsets and approaches. We create culture/language-aware classifiers by\nexperimenting with a wide range of n-gram features based on phonology,\nmorphology and syntax, other linguistic cues like word and phoneme counts,\npronouns use, etc., and token embeddings. We conducted our experiments over 11\ndatasets from 5 languages i.e., English, Dutch, Russian, Spanish and Romanian,\nfrom six countries (US, Belgium, India, Russia, Mexico and Romania), and we\napplied two classification methods i.e, logistic regression and fine-tuned BERT\nmodels. The results showed that our task is fairly complex and demanding. There\nare indications that some linguistic cues of deception have cultural origins,\nand are consistent in the context of diverse domains and dataset settings for\nthe same language. This is more evident for the usage of pronouns and the\nexpression of sentiment in deceptive language. The results of this work show\nthat the automatic deception detection across cultures and languages cannot be\nhandled in a unified manner, and that such approaches should be augmented with\nknowledge about cultural differences and the domains of interest.",

By studying online communication along the three dimensions\nof social interactions (connectivity, interactivity and language use), the\nauthors aim to provide VCoP managers with valuable insights to improve the\nsuccess of their communities. Design/methodology/approach: Communications over\na period of seven years (April 2008 to April 2015) and between 14,000 members\nof 16 different healthcare VCoPs coexisting on the same web platform were\nanalysed. Multilevel regression models were used to reveal the main\ndeterminants of community growth over time. Independent variables were derived\nfrom social network and semantic analysis measures. Findings: Results show that\nstructural and content-based variables predict the growth of the community.\nProgressively, more people will join a community if its structure is more\ncentralised, leaders are more dynamic (they rotate more) and the language used\nin the posts is less complex. Research limitations/implications: The available\ndata set included one Web platform and a limited number of control variables.\nTo consolidate the findings of the present study, the experiment should be\nreplicated on other healthcare VCoPs. Originality/value: The study provides\nuseful recommendations for setting up and nurturing the growth of professional\ncommunities, considering, at the same time, the interaction patterns among the\ncommunity members, the dynamic evolution of these interactions and the use of\nlanguage. New analytical tools are presented, together with the use of\ninnovative interaction metrics, that can significantly influence community\ngrowth, such as rotating leadership.",

Motivated by our findings, we formulate three groups of\nimplications that together help us formulate a renewed perspective on future\nresearch on automatic summarization. First, the educational domain requires a\nbroader perspective on automatic summarization, beyond the approaches that are\ncurrently the standard. We illustrate how we can expand these approaches\nregarding the input material, the purpose of the summaries and their potential\nformat and we define requirements for datasets that can facilitate these\nresearch directions. Second, we propose a methodology to evaluate the\nusefulness of a summary based on the identified needs of a target group.

          "description": "Social media is becoming a primary medium to discuss what is happening around\nthe world. Therefore, the data generated by social media platforms contain rich\ninformation which describes the ongoing events. Further, the timeliness\nassociated with these data is capable of facilitating immediate insights.\nHowever, considering the dynamic nature and high volume of data production in\nsocial media data streams, it is impractical to filter the events manually and\ntherefore, automated event detection mechanisms are invaluable to the\ncommunity. Apart from a few notable exceptions, most previous research on\nautomated event detection have focused only on statistical and syntactical\nfeatures in data and lacked the involvement of underlying semantics which are\nimportant for effective information retrieval from text since they represent\nthe connections between words and their meanings. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel method termed Embed2Detect for event detection in social media by\ncombining the characteristics in word embeddings and hierarchical agglomerative\nclustering. The adoption of word embeddings gives Embed2Detect the capability\nto incorporate powerful semantical features into event detection and overcome a\nmajor limitation inherent in previous approaches. We experimented our method on\ntwo recent real social media data sets which represent the sports and political\ndomain and also compared the results to several state-of-the-art methods. The\nobtained results show that Embed2Detect is capable of effective and efficient\nevent detection and it outperforms the recent event detection methods. For the\nsports data set, Embed2Detect achieved 27% higher F-measure than the\nbest-performed baseline and for the political data set, it was an increase of\n29%.",

          "description": "Backdoor attacks are a kind of insidious security threat against machine\nlearning models. After being injected with a backdoor in training, the victim\nmodel will produce adversary-specified outputs on the inputs embedded with\npredesigned triggers but behave properly on normal inputs during inference. As\na sort of emergent attack, backdoor attacks in natural language processing\n(NLP) are investigated insufficiently. As far as we know, almost all existing\ntextual backdoor attack methods insert additional contents into normal samples\nas triggers, which causes the trigger-embedded samples to be detected and the\nbackdoor attacks to be blocked without much effort. In this paper, we propose\nto use syntactic structure as the trigger in textual backdoor attacks. We\nconduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the syntactic trigger-based\nattack method can achieve comparable attack performance (almost 100\\% success\nrate) to the insertion-based methods but possesses much higher invisibility and\nstronger resistance to defenses. These results also reveal the significant\ninsidiousness and harmfulness of textual backdoor attacks. All the code and\ndata of this paper can be obtained at https://github.com/thunlp/HiddenKiller.",

So far, none of the\nvisualization systems has yet managed to examine all the facets of the\nTransformers. This gave us the motivation of the current work. We propose a new\nNLP Transformer context-sensitive visualization method that leverages existing\nNLP tools to find the most significant groups of tokens (words) that have the\ngreatest effect on the output, thus preserving some context from the original\ntext. First, we use a sentence-level dependency parser to highlight promising\nword groups. The dependency parser creates a tree of relationships between the\nwords in the sentence. Next, we systematically remove adjacent and non-adjacent\ntuples of \\emph{n} tokens from the input text, producing several new texts with\nthose tokens missing. The resulting texts are then passed to a pre-trained BERT\nmodel. The classification output is compared with that of the full text, and\nthe difference in the activation strength is recorded. The modified texts that\nproduce the largest difference in the target classification output neuron are\nselected, and the combination of removed words are then considered to be the\nmost influential on the model's output. Finally, the most influential word\ncombinations are visualized in a heatmap.",

          "description": "Estimating the expected output quality of generation systems is central to\nNLG. This paper qualifies the notion that automatic metrics are not as good as\nhumans in estimating system-level quality. Statistically, humans are unbiased,\nhigh variance estimators, while metrics are biased, low variance estimators. We\ncompare these estimators by their error in pairwise prediction (which\ngeneration system is better?) using the bootstrap. Measuring this error is\ncomplicated: predictions are evaluated against noisy, human predicted labels\ninstead of the ground truth, and metric predictions fluctuate based on the test\nsets they were calculated on. By applying a bias-variance-noise decomposition,\nwe adjust this error to a noise-free, infinite test set setting. Our analysis\ncompares the adjusted error of metrics to humans and a derived, perfect\nsegment-level annotator, both of which are unbiased estimators dependent on the\nnumber of judgments collected. In MT, we identify two settings where metrics\noutperform humans due to a statistical advantage in variance: when the number\nof human judgments used is small, and when the quality difference between\ncompared systems is small.

Chatbots using traditional techniques analyze emotions based on the\ncontext and meaning of the text and lack the understanding of emotions\nexpressed through face. Emojis representing facial expressions present a\npromising way to express emotions. However, none of the AI systems utilizes\nemojis for empathetic conversation generation. We propose, SentEmojiBot, based\non the SentEmoji dataset, to generate empathetic conversations with a\ncombination of emojis and text. Evaluation metrics show that the BERT-based\nmodel outperforms the vanilla transformer model.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to find an appropriate\ntokenization to a given downstream model by jointly optimizing a tokenizer and\nthe model. The proposed method has no restriction except for using loss values\ncomputed by the downstream model to train the tokenizer, and thus, we can apply\nthe proposed method to any NLP task. Moreover, the proposed method can be used\nto explore the appropriate tokenization for an already trained model as\npost-processing. Therefore, the proposed method is applicable to various\nsituations.

          "description": "Despite existing pioneering works on sign language translation (SLT), there\nis a non-trivial obstacle, i.e., the limited quantity of parallel sign-text\ndata. To tackle this parallel data bottleneck, we propose a sign\nback-translation (SignBT) approach, which incorporates massive spoken language\ntexts into SLT training. With a text-to-gloss translation model, we first\nback-translate the monolingual text to its gloss sequence. Then, the paired\nsign sequence is generated by splicing pieces from an estimated gloss-to-sign\nbank at the feature level. Finally, the synthetic parallel data serves as a\nstrong supplement for the end-to-end training of the encoder-decoder SLT\nframework.\n\nTo promote the SLT research, we further contribute CSL-Daily, a large-scale\ncontinuous SLT dataset. It provides both spoken language translations and\ngloss-level annotations. The topic revolves around people's daily lives (e.g.,\ntravel, shopping, medical care), the most likely SLT application scenario.\nExtensive experimental results and analysis of SLT methods are reported on\nCSL-Daily.

          "description": "Distributional semantics based on neural approaches is a cornerstone of\nNatural Language Processing, with surprising connections to human meaning\nrepresentation as well. Recent Transformer-based Language Models have proven\ncapable of producing contextual word representations that reliably convey\nsense-specific information, simply as a product of self-supervision. Prior work\nhas shown that these contextual representations can be used to accurately\nrepresent large sense inventories as sense embeddings, to the extent that a\ndistance-based solution to Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) tasks outperforms\nmodels trained specifically for the task. Still, there remains much to\nunderstand on how to use these Neural Language Models (NLMs) to produce sense\nembeddings that can better harness each NLM's meaning representation abilities.\nIn this work we introduce a more principled approach to leverage information\nfrom all layers of NLMs, informed by a probing analysis on 14 NLM variants. We\nalso emphasize the versatility of these sense embeddings in contrast to\ntask-specific models, applying them on several sense-related tasks, besides\nWSD, while demonstrating improved performance using our proposed approach over\nprior work focused on sense embeddings. Finally, we discuss unexpected findings\nregarding layer and model performance variations, and potential applications\nfor downstream tasks.",

          "description": "Recently, token-level adaptive training has achieved promising improvement in\nmachine translation, where the cross-entropy loss function is adjusted by\nassigning different training weights to different tokens, in order to alleviate\nthe token imbalance problem. However, previous approaches only use static word\nfrequency information in the target language without considering the source\nlanguage, which is insufficient for bilingual tasks like machine translation.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel bilingual mutual information (BMI) based\nadaptive objective, which measures the learning difficulty for each target\ntoken from the perspective of bilingualism, and assigns an adaptive weight\naccordingly to improve token-level adaptive training. This method assigns\nlarger training weights to tokens with higher BMI, so that easy tokens are\nupdated with coarse granularity while difficult tokens are updated with fine\ngranularity. Experimental results on WMT14 English-to-German and WMT19\nChinese-to-English demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with\nthe Transformer baseline and previous token-level adaptive training approaches.\nFurther analyses confirm that our method can improve the lexical diversity.",

We focus on graph-based transformer models for MDS as they\ngained recent popularity. We aim to improve the explainability of the\ngraph-based MDS by analyzing their attention weights. In a graph-based MDS such\nas GraphSum, vertices represent the textual units, while the edges form some\nsimilarity graph over the units. We compare GraphSum's performance utilizing\ndifferent textual units, i. e., sentences versus paragraphs, on two news\nbenchmark datasets, namely WikiSum and MultiNews. Our experiments show that\nparagraph-level representations provide the best summarization performance.\nThus, we subsequently focus oAnalysisn analyzing the paragraph-level attention\nweights of GraphSum's multi-heads and decoding layers in order to improve the\nexplainability of a transformer-based MDS model. As a reference metric, we\ncalculate the ROUGE scores between the input paragraphs and each sentence in\nthe generated summary, which indicate source origin information via text\nsimilarity. We observe a high correlation between the attention weights and\nthis reference metric, especially on the the later decoding layers of the\ntransformer architecture. Finally, we investigate if the generated summaries\nfollow a pattern of positional bias by extracting which paragraph provided the\nmost information for each generated summary.

          "description": "Many people consider news articles to be a reliable source of information on\ncurrent events. However, due to the range of factors influencing news agencies,\nsuch coverage may not always be impartial. Media bias, or slanted news\ncoverage, can have a substantial impact on public perception of events, and,\naccordingly, can potentially alter the beliefs and views of the public. The\nmain data gap in current research on media bias detection is a robust,\nrepresentative, and diverse dataset containing annotations of biased words and\nsentences. In particular, existing datasets do not control for the individual\nbackground of annotators, which may affect their assessment and, thus,\nrepresents critical information for contextualizing their annotations. In this\nposter, we present a matrix-based methodology to crowdsource such data using a\nself-developed annotation platform. We also present MBIC (Media Bias Including\nCharacteristics) - the first sample of 1,700 statements representing various\nmedia bias instances. The statements were reviewed by ten annotators each and\ncontain labels for media bias identification both on the word and sentence\nlevel. MBIC is the first available dataset about media bias reporting detailed\ninformation on annotator characteristics and their individual background. The\ncurrent dataset already significantly extends existing data in this domain\nproviding unique and more reliable insights into the perception of bias.

          "description": "The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis suggests that an over-parametrized network\nconsists of \"lottery tickets\", and training a certain collection of them (i.e.,\na subnetwork) can match the performance of the full model. In this paper, we\nstudy such a collection of tickets, which is referred to as \"winning tickets\",\nin extremely over-parametrized models, e.g., pre-trained language models. We\nobserve that at certain compression ratios, generalization performance of the\nwinning tickets can not only match, but also exceed that of the full model. In\nparticular, we observe a phase transition phenomenon: As the compression ratio\nincreases, generalization performance of the winning tickets first improves\nthen deteriorates after a certain threshold. We refer to the tickets on the\nthreshold as \"super tickets\". We further show that the phase transition is task\nand model dependent -- as model size becomes larger and training data set\nbecomes smaller, the transition becomes more pronounced. Our experiments on the\nGLUE benchmark show that the super tickets improve single task fine-tuning by\n$0.9$ points on BERT-base and $1.0$ points on BERT-large, in terms of\ntask-average score. We also demonstrate that adaptively sharing the super\ntickets across tasks benefits multi-task learning.",

          "description": "Sentiment analysis (SA) is an important research area in cognitive\ncomputation-thus in-depth studies of patterns of sentiment analysis are\nnecessary. At present, rich resource data-based SA has been well developed,\nwhile the more challenging and practical multi-source unsupervised SA (i.e. a\ntarget domain SA by transferring from multiple source domains) is seldom\nstudied. The challenges behind this problem mainly locate in the lack of\nsupervision information, the semantic gaps among domains (i.e., domain shifts),\nand the loss of knowledge. However, existing methods either lack the\ndistinguishable capacity of the semantic gaps among domains or lose private\nknowledge. To alleviate these problems, we propose a two-stage domain\nadaptation framework. In the first stage, a multi-task methodology-based\nshared-private architecture is employed to explicitly model the domain common\nfeatures and the domain-specific features for the labeled source domains. In\nthe second stage, two elaborate mechanisms are embedded in the shared private\narchitecture to transfer knowledge from multiple source domains. The first\nmechanism is a selective domain adaptation (SDA) method, which transfers\nknowledge from the closest source domain. And the second mechanism is a\ntarget-oriented ensemble (TOE) method, in which knowledge is transferred\nthrough a well-designed ensemble method. Extensive experiment evaluations\nverify that the performance of the proposed framework outperforms unsupervised\nstate-of-the-art competitors. What can be concluded from the experiments is\nthat transferring from very different distributed source domains may degrade\nthe target-domain performance, and it is crucial to choose the proper source\ndomains to transfer from.",

In\nthis context we propose CoRT, a simple neural first-stage ranking model that\nleverages contextual representations from pretrained language models such as\nBERT to complement term-based ranking functions while causing no significant\ndelay at query time. Using the MS MARCO dataset, we show that CoRT\nsignificantly increases the candidate recall by complementing BM25 with missing\ncandidates.

          "description": "Interactive robots navigating photo-realistic environments face challenges\nunderlying vision-and-language navigation (VLN), but in addition, they need to\nbe trained to handle the dynamic nature of dialogue. However, research in\nCooperative Vision-and-Dialog Navigation (CVDN), where a navigator interacts\nwith a guide in natural language in order to reach a goal, treats the dialogue\nhistory as a VLN-style static instruction. In this paper, we present VISITRON,\na navigator better suited to the interactive regime inherent to CVDN by being\ntrained to: i) identify and associate object-level concepts and semantics\nbetween the environment and dialogue history, ii) identify when to interact vs.\nnavigate via imitation learning of a binary classification head. We perform\nextensive ablations with VISITRON to gain empirical insights and improve\nperformance on CVDN. VISITRON is competitive with models on the static CVDN\nleaderboard. We also propose a generalized interactive regime to fine-tune and\nevaluate VISITRON and future such models with pre-trained guides for\nadaptability.",

Namely, we find cases of persistent outlier\nneurons within BERT and RoBERTa's hidden state vectors that consistently bear\nthe smallest or largest values in said vectors. In an attempt to investigate\nthe source of this information, we introduce a neuron-level analysis method,\nwhich reveals that the outliers are closely related to information captured by\npositional embeddings. We also pre-train the RoBERTa-base models from scratch\nand find that the outliers disappear without using positional embeddings. These\noutliers, we find, are the major cause of anisotropy of encoders' raw vector\nspaces, and clipping them leads to increased similarity across vectors. We\ndemonstrate this in practice by showing that clipped vectors can more\naccurately distinguish word senses, as well as lead to better sentence\nembeddings when mean pooling. In three supervised tasks, we find that clipping\ndoes not affect the performance.",

To distinguish these accounts, we introduce a\nnew paradigm called signaling bandits, generalizing classic Lewis signaling\ngames to a multi-armed bandit setting where all targets in the context have\nsome relative value. We develop three speaker models: a belief-oriented speaker\nwith a purely informative objective; an action-oriented speaker with an\ninstrumental objective; and a combined speaker which integrates the two by\ninducing listener beliefs that generally lead to desirable actions. We then\npresent a series of simulations demonstrating that grounding production choices\nin future listener actions results in relevance effects and flexible uses of\nnonliteral language.

A scalable paradigm for adaptation necessitates the\ndevelopment of generalizable models that perform well in few-shot settings. In\nthis paper, we focus on the intent classification problem which aims to\nidentify user intents given utterances addressed to the dialog system. We\npropose two approaches for improving the generalizability of utterance\nclassification models: (1) observers and (2) example-driven training. Prior\nwork has shown that BERT-like models tend to attribute a significant amount of\nattention to the [CLS] token, which we hypothesize results in diluted\nrepresentations. Observers are tokens that are not attended to, and are an\nalternative to the [CLS] token as a semantic representation of utterances.\nExample-driven training learns to classify utterances by comparing to examples,\nthereby using the underlying encoder as a sentence similarity model. These\nmethods are complementary; improving the representation through observers\nallows the example-driven model to better measure sentence similarities. When\ncombined, the proposed methods attain state-of-the-art results on three intent\nprediction datasets (\\textsc{banking77}, \\textsc{clinc150}, \\textsc{hwu64}) in\nboth the full data and few-shot (10 examples per intent) settings.

          "description": "Abstractive summarization for long-document or multi-document remains\nchallenging for the Seq2Seq architecture, as Seq2Seq is not good at analyzing\nlong-distance relations in text. In this paper, we present BASS, a novel\nframework for Boosting Abstractive Summarization based on a unified Semantic\ngraph, which aggregates co-referent phrases distributing across a long range of\ncontext and conveys rich relations between phrases. Further, a graph-based\nencoder-decoder model is proposed to improve both the document representation\nand summary generation process by leveraging the graph structure. Specifically,\nseveral graph augmentation methods are designed to encode both the explicit and\nimplicit relations in the text while the graph-propagation attention mechanism\nis developed in the decoder to select salient content into the summary.\nEmpirical results show that the proposed architecture brings substantial\nimprovements for both long-document and multi-document summarization tasks.",

In this paper we solve these problems by reformulating DisCoCat as a\npassage from Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) to a category of semantics.\nWe start by showing that standard categorial grammars can be expressed as a\nbiclosed category, where all rules emerge as currying/uncurrying the identity;\nwe then proceed to model permutation-inducing rules by exploiting the symmetry\nof the compact closed category encoding the word meaning.

          "description": "Most language understanding models in task-oriented dialog systems are\ntrained on a small amount of annotated training data, and evaluated in a small\nset from the same distribution. However, these models can lead to system\nfailure or undesirable output when being exposed to natural language\nperturbation or variation in practice. In this paper, we conduct comprehensive\nevaluation and analysis with respect to the robustness of natural language\nunderstanding models, and introduce three important aspects related to language\nunderstanding in real-world dialog systems, namely, language variety, speech\ncharacteristics, and noise perturbation. We propose a model-agnostic toolkit\nLAUG to approximate natural language perturbations for testing the robustness\nissues in task-oriented dialog. Four data augmentation approaches covering the\nthree aspects are assembled in LAUG, which reveals critical robustness issues\nin state-of-the-art models. The augmented dataset through LAUG can be used to\nfacilitate future research on the robustness testing of language understanding\nin task-oriented dialog.",

The previous work attempts to solve this problem in\nthe identify-then-classify manner but ignores the trigger discrepancy between\nevent types, thus suffering from the error propagation. In this paper, we\npresent a novel unified model which converts the task to a few-shot tagging\nproblem with a double-part tagging scheme. To this end, we first propose the\nPrototypical Amortized Conditional Random Field (PA-CRF) to model the label\ndependency in the few-shot scenario, which approximates the transition scores\nbetween labels based on the label prototypes. Then Gaussian distribution is\nintroduced for modeling of the transition scores to alleviate the uncertain\nestimation resulting from insufficient data. Experimental results show that the\nunified models work better than existing identify-then-classify models and our\nPA-CRF further achieves the best results on the benchmark dataset FewEvent.

          "description": "Existing methods for vision-and-language learning typically require designing\ntask-specific architectures and objectives for each task. For example, a\nmulti-label answer classifier for visual question answering, a region scorer\nfor referring expression comprehension, and a language decoder for image\ncaptioning, etc. To alleviate these hassles, in this work, we propose a unified\nframework that learns different tasks in a single architecture with the same\nlanguage modeling objective, i.e., multimodal conditional text generation,\nwhere our models learn to generate labels in text based on the visual and\ntextual inputs. On 7 popular vision-and-language benchmarks, including visual\nquestion answering, referring expression comprehension, visual commonsense\nreasoning, most of which have been previously modeled as discriminative tasks,\nour generative approach (with a single unified architecture) reaches comparable\nperformance to recent task-specific state-of-the-art vision-and-language\nmodels. Moreover, our generative approach shows better generalization ability\non questions that have rare answers. Also, we show that our framework allows\nmulti-task learning in a single architecture with a single set of parameters,\nachieving similar performance to separately optimized single-task models.

We evaluate three pretrained V&L models on these tasks: ViLBERT,\nViLBERT 12-in-1 and LXMERT, in zero-shot and finetuned settings. Our results\nshow that models solve task (1) very well, as expected, since all models are\npretrained on task (1). However, none of the pretrained V&L models is able to\nadequately solve task (2), our counting probe, and they cannot generalise to\nout-of-distribution quantities. We propose a number of explanations for these\nfindings: LXMERT (and to some extent ViLBERT 12-in-1) show some evidence of\ncatastrophic forgetting on task (1). Concerning our results on the counting\nprobe, we find evidence that all models are impacted by dataset bias, and also\nfail to individuate entities in the visual input.

Recent work on analyzing contextualized text\nrepresentations has focused on hand-designed probe models to understand how and\nto what extent do these representations encode a particular linguistic\nphenomenon. However, due to the inter-dependence of various phenomena and\nrandomness of training probe models, detecting how these representations encode\nthe rich information in these linguistic graphs remains a challenging problem.\nIn this paper, we propose a new information-theoretic probe, Bird's Eye, which\nis a fairly simple probe method for detecting if and how these representations\nencode the information in these linguistic graphs. Instead of using classifier\nperformance, our probe takes an information-theoretic view of probing and\nestimates the mutual information between the linguistic graph embedded in a\ncontinuous space and the contextualized word representations. Furthermore, we\nalso propose an approach to use our probe to investigate localized linguistic\ninformation in the linguistic graphs using perturbation analysis. We call this\nprobing setup Worm's Eye. Using these probes, we analyze BERT models on their\nability to encode a syntactic and a semantic graph structure, and find that\nthese models encode to some degree both syntactic as well as semantic\ninformation; albeit syntactic information to a greater extent.",

          "description": "We study the learning of a matching model for dialogue response selection.\nMotivated by the recent finding that models trained with random negative\nsamples are not ideal in real-world scenarios, we propose a hierarchical\ncurriculum learning framework that trains the matching model in an\n\"easy-to-difficult\" scheme. Our learning framework consists of two\ncomplementary curricula: (1) corpus-level curriculum (CC); and (2)\ninstance-level curriculum (IC). In CC, the model gradually increases its\nability in finding the matching clues between the dialogue context and a\nresponse candidate. As for IC, it progressively strengthens the model's ability\nin identifying the mismatching information between the dialogue context and a\nresponse candidate. Empirical studies on three benchmark datasets with three\nstate-of-the-art matching models demonstrate that the proposed learning\nframework significantly improves the model performance across various\nevaluation metrics.",

To address these challenges, we propose a unified\nQA framework to answer any-hop open-domain questions, which iteratively\nretrieves, reranks and filters documents, and adaptively determines when to\nstop the retrieval process. To improve the retrieval accuracy, we propose a\ngraph-based reranking model that perform multi-document interaction as the core\nof our iterative reranking framework.

We test two model selection criteria, cross-validation\nand minimum description length, for choosing LM prompts and hyperparameters in\nthe true few-shot setting.

          "description": "This paper proposes an any-to-many location-relative, sequence-to-sequence\n(seq2seq), non-parallel voice conversion approach, which utilizes text\nsupervision during training. In this approach, we combine a bottle-neck feature\nextractor (BNE) with a seq2seq synthesis module. During the training stage, an\nencoder-decoder-based hybrid connectionist-temporal-classification-attention\n(CTC-attention) phoneme recognizer is trained, whose encoder has a bottle-neck\nlayer. A BNE is obtained from the phoneme recognizer and is utilized to extract\nspeaker-independent, dense and rich spoken content representations from\nspectral features. Then a multi-speaker location-relative attention based\nseq2seq synthesis model is trained to reconstruct spectral features from the\nbottle-neck features, conditioning on speaker representations for speaker\nidentity control in the generated speech. To mitigate the difficulties of using\nseq2seq models to align long sequences, we down-sample the input spectral\nfeature along the temporal dimension and equip the synthesis model with a\ndiscretized mixture of logistic (MoL) attention mechanism. Since the phoneme\nrecognizer is trained with large speech recognition data corpus, the proposed\napproach can conduct any-to-many voice conversion. Objective and subjective\nevaluations show that the proposed any-to-many approach has superior voice\nconversion performance in terms of both naturalness and speaker similarity.\nAblation studies are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of feature\nselection and model design strategies in the proposed approach. The proposed VC\napproach can readily be extended to support any-to-any VC (also known as\none/few-shot VC), and achieve high performance according to objective and\nsubjective evaluations.",

However, the number of\nadversarial examples for text augmentation is still extremely insufficient due\nto the exponentially large attack search space. In this work, we propose a\nsimple and effective method to cover a much larger proportion of the attack\nsearch space, called Adversarial and Mixup Data Augmentation (AMDA).\nSpecifically, AMDA linearly interpolates the representations of pairs of\ntraining samples to form new virtual samples, which are more abundant and\ndiverse than the discrete text adversarial examples in conventional ADA.\nMoreover, to fairly evaluate the robustness of different models, we adopt a\nchallenging evaluation setup, which generates a new set of adversarial examples\ntargeting each model. In text classification experiments of BERT and RoBERTa,\nAMDA achieves significant robustness gains under two strong adversarial attacks\nand alleviates the performance degradation of ADA on the clean data.

However, the gains from these\ndiversification processes has seemed to plateau.

          "description": "Fine-tuned pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved awesome\nperformance on almost all NLP tasks. By using additional prompts to fine-tune\nPLMs, we can further stimulate the rich knowledge distributed in PLMs to better\nserve downstream task. Prompt tuning has achieved promising results on some\nfew-class classification tasks such as sentiment classification and natural\nlanguage inference. However, manually designing lots of language prompts is\ncumbersome and fallible. For those auto-generated prompts, it is also expensive\nand time-consuming to verify their effectiveness in non-few-shot scenarios.\nHence, it is challenging for prompt tuning to address many-class classification\ntasks. To this end, we propose prompt tuning with rules (PTR) for many-class\ntext classification, and apply logic rules to construct prompts with several\nsub-prompts. In this way, PTR is able to encode prior knowledge of each class\ninto prompt tuning. We conduct experiments on relation classification, a\ntypical many-class classification task, and the results on benchmarks show that\nPTR can significantly and consistently outperform existing state-of-the-art\nbaselines. This indicates that PTR is a promising approach to take advantage of\nPLMs for those complicated classification tasks.",

          "description": "Virtual Personal Assistants like Siri have great potential but such\ndevelopments hit the fundamental problem of how to make computational devices\nthat understand human speech. Natural language understanding is one of the more\ndisappointing failures of AI research and it seems there is something we\ncomputer scientists don't get about the nature of language. Of course\nphilosophers and linguists think quite differently about language and this\npaper describes how we have taken ideas from other disciplines and implemented\nthem. The background to the work is to take seriously the notion of language as\naction and look at what people actually do with language using the techniques\nof Conversation Analysis. The observation has been that human communication is\n(behind the scenes) about the management of social relations as well as the\n(foregrounded) passing of information. To claim this is one thing but to\nimplement it requires a mechanism. The mechanism described here is based on the\nnotion of language being intentional - we think intentionally, talk about them\nand recognise them in others - and cooperative in that we are compelled to help\nout. The way we are compelled points to a solution to the ever present problem\nof keeping the human on topic. The approach has led to a recent success in\nwhich we significantly improve user satisfaction independent of task\ncompletion.

Recent studies have shown great\nprogress on denoising, but pay little attention to the problem of long-tailed\nrelations. In this paper, we introduce constraint graphs to model the\ndependencies between relation labels. On top of that, we further propose a\nnovel constraint graph-based relation extraction framework(CGRE) to handle the\ntwo challenges simultaneously. CGRE employs graph convolution networks (GCNs)\nto propagate information from data-rich relation nodes to data-poor relation\nnodes, and thus boosts the representation learning of long-tailed relations. To\nfurther improve the noise immunity, a constraint-aware attention module is\ndesigned in CGRE to integrate the constraint information. Experimental results\non a widely-used benchmark dataset indicate that our approach achieves\nsignificant improvements over the previous methods for both denoising and\nlong-tailed relation extraction.",

The main reason is that NMT pays excessive\nattention to the partial translation while neglecting the source sentence to\nsome extent, namely overconfidence of the LM.

Existing\nabusive language detection techniques are particularly ill-suited to comments\ncontaining heterogeneous abusive language patterns, i.e., both abusive and\nnon-abusive parts. This is due in part to the lack of datasets that explicitly\nannotate heterogeneity in abusive language. We tackle this challenge by\nproviding an annotated dataset of abusive language in over 11,000 comments from\nYouTube. We account for heterogeneity in this dataset by separately annotating\nboth the comment as a whole and the individual sentences that comprise each\ncomment. We then propose an algorithm that uses a supervised attention\nmechanism to detect and categorize abusive content using multi-task learning.\nWe empirically demonstrate the challenges of using traditional techniques on\nheterogeneous content and the comparative gains in performance of the proposed\napproach over state-of-the-art methods.",

This suggested that natural language can be\napproximated well with models that are too weak for formal languages, or that\nthe role of hierarchy and recursion in natural language might be limited. We\nqualify this implication by proving that self-attention networks can process\n$\\mathsf{Dyck}_{k, D}$, the subset of $\\mathsf{Dyck}_{k}$ with depth bounded by\n$D$, which arguably better captures the bounded hierarchical structure of\nnatural language. Specifically, we construct a hard-attention network with\n$D+1$ layers and $O(\\log k)$ memory size (per token per layer) that recognizes\n$\\mathsf{Dyck}_{k, D}$, and a soft-attention network with two layers and\n$O(\\log k)$ memory size that generates $\\mathsf{Dyck}_{k, D}$. Experiments show\nthat self-attention networks trained on $\\mathsf{Dyck}_{k, D}$ generalize to\nlonger inputs with near-perfect accuracy, and also verify the theoretical\nmemory advantage of self-attention networks over recurrent networks.",

          "description": "The advances in pre-trained models (e.g., BERT, XLNET and etc) have largely\nrevolutionized the predictive performance of various modern natural language\nprocessing tasks. This allows corporations to provide machine learning as a\nservice (MLaaS) by encapsulating fine-tuned BERT-based models as commercial\nAPIs. However, previous works have discovered a series of vulnerabilities in\nBERT- based APIs. For example, BERT-based APIs are vulnerable to both model\nextraction attack and adversarial example transferrability attack. However, due\nto the high capacity of BERT-based APIs, the fine-tuned model is easy to be\noverlearned, what kind of information can be leaked from the extracted model\nremains unknown and is lacking. To bridge this gap, in this work, we first\npresent an effective model extraction attack, where the adversary can\npractically steal a BERT-based API (the target/victim model) by only querying a\nlimited number of queries. We further develop an effective attribute inference\nattack to expose the sensitive attribute of the training data used by the\nBERT-based APIs.

This publicly-generated user data\nis also crucial to healthcare technologies because the discovered patterns\nwould hugely benefit them in several ways. One of the applications is in\nautomatically discovering mental health problems, e.g., depression. Previous\nstudies to automatically detect a depressed user on online social media have\nlargely relied upon the user behaviour and their linguistic patterns including\nuser's social interactions. The downside is that these models are trained on\nseveral irrelevant content which might not be crucial towards detecting a\ndepressed user. Besides, these content have a negative impact on the overall\nefficiency and effectiveness of the model. To overcome the shortcomings in the\nexisting automatic depression detection methods, we propose a novel\ncomputational framework for automatic depression detection that initially\nselects relevant content through a hybrid extractive and abstractive\nsummarization strategy on the sequence of all user tweets leading to a more\nfine-grained and relevant content.

This paper addresses two technical challenges related to\nthe problem before developing a practical method. First, we formalize the\ncausal quantity of interest as the effect of a writer's intent, and establish\nthe assumptions necessary to identify this from observational data. Second, in\npractice, we only have access to noisy proxies for the linguistic properties of\ninterest -- e.g., predictions from classifiers and lexicons. We propose an\nestimator for this setting and prove that its bias is bounded when we perform\nan adjustment for the text. Based on these results, we introduce TextCause, an\nalgorithm for estimating causal effects of linguistic properties.

          "description": "Contemporary approaches to perception, planning, estimation, and control have\nallowed robots to operate robustly as our remote surrogates in uncertain,\nunstructured environments. There is now an opportunity for robots to operate\nnot only in isolation, but also with and alongside humans in our complex\nenvironments. Natural language provides an efficient and flexible medium\nthrough which humans can communicate with collaborative robots. Through\nsignificant progress in statistical methods for natural language understanding,\nrobots are now able to interpret a diverse array of free-form navigation,\nmanipulation, and mobile manipulation commands. However, most contemporary\napproaches require a detailed prior spatial-semantic map of the robot's\nenvironment that models the space of possible referents of the utterance.\nConsequently, these methods fail when robots are deployed in new, previously\nunknown, or partially observed environments, particularly when mental models of\nthe environment differ between the human operator and the robot. This paper\nprovides a comprehensive description of a novel learning framework that allows\nfield and service robots to interpret and correctly execute natural language\ninstructions in a priori unknown, unstructured environments. Integral to our\napproach is its use of language as a \"sensor\" -- inferring spatial,\ntopological, and semantic information implicit in natural language utterances\nand then exploiting this information to learn a distribution over a latent\nenvironment model. We incorporate this distribution in a probabilistic language\ngrounding model and infer a distribution over a symbolic representation of the\nrobot's action space. We use imitation learning to identify a belief space\npolicy that reasons over the environment and behavior distributions. We\nevaluate our framework through a variety of different navigation and mobile\nmanipulation experiments.",

          "description": "In a dialogue system pipeline, a natural language generation (NLG) unit\nconverts the dialogue direction and content to a corresponding natural language\nrealization. A recent trend for dialogue systems is to first pre-train on large\ndatasets and then fine-tune in a supervised manner using datasets annotated\nwith application-specific features. Though novel behaviours can be learned from\ncustom annotation, the required effort severely bounds the quantity of the\ntraining set, and the application-specific nature limits the reuse. In light of\nthe recent success of data-driven approaches, we propose the novel future\nbridging NLG (FBNLG) concept for dialogue systems and simulators. The critical\nstep is for an FBNLG to accept a future user or system utterance to bridge the\npresent context towards. Future bridging enables self supervised training over\nannotation-free datasets, decoupled the training of NLG from the rest of the\nsystem. An FBNLG, pre-trained with massive datasets, is expected to apply in\nclassical or new dialogue scenarios with minimal adaptation effort. We evaluate\na prototype FBNLG to show that future bridging can be a viable approach to a\nuniversal few-shot NLG for task-oriented and chit-chat dialogues.",

          "description": "The problem of knowledge-based visual question answering involves answering\nquestions that require external knowledge in addition to the content of the\nimage. Such knowledge typically comes in a variety of forms, including visual,\ntextual, and commonsense knowledge. The use of more knowledge sources, however,\nalso increases the chance of retrieving more irrelevant or noisy facts, making\nit difficult to comprehend the facts and find the answer. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Multi-modal Answer Validation using External knowledge\n(MAVEx), where the idea is to validate a set of promising answer candidates\nbased on answer-specific knowledge retrieval. This is in contrast to existing\napproaches that search for the answer in a vast collection of often irrelevant\nfacts. Our approach aims to learn which knowledge source should be trusted for\neach answer candidate and how to validate the candidate using that source. We\nconsider a multi-modal setting, relying on both textual and visual knowledge\nresources, including images searched using Google, sentences from Wikipedia\narticles, and concepts from ConceptNet. Our experiments with OK-VQA, a\nchallenging knowledge-based VQA dataset, demonstrate that MAVEx achieves new\nstate-of-the-art results.",

Like word embeddings, sentence embeddings are\ntypically learned on large text corpora and then transferred to various\ndownstream tasks, such as clustering and retrieval. Unlike word embeddings, the\nhighest performing solutions for learning sentence embeddings require labelled\ndata, limiting their usefulness to languages and domains where labelled data is\nabundant. In this paper, we present DeCLUTR: Deep Contrastive Learning for\nUnsupervised Textual Representations. Inspired by recent advances in deep\nmetric learning (DML), we carefully design a self-supervised objective for\nlearning universal sentence embeddings that does not require labelled training\ndata. When used to extend the pretraining of transformer-based language models,\nour approach closes the performance gap between unsupervised and supervised\npretraining for universal sentence encoders. Importantly, our experiments\nsuggest that the quality of the learned embeddings scale with both the number\nof trainable parameters and the amount of unlabelled training data, making\nfurther improvements straightforward.

In\nthis paper, we propose a few-shot personalized conversation task with an\nauxiliary social network. The task requires models to generate personalized\nresponses for a speaker given a few conversations from the speaker and a social\nnetwork. Existing methods are mainly designed to incorporate descriptions or\nconversation histories. Those methods can hardly model speakers with so few\nconversations or connections between speakers. To better cater for newcomers\nwith few resources, we propose a personalized conversation model (PCM) that\nlearns to adapt to new speakers as well as enabling new speakers to learn from\nresource-rich speakers. Particularly, based on a meta-learning based PCM, we\npropose a task aggregator (TA) to collect other speakers' information from the\nsocial network. The TA provides prior knowledge of the new speaker in its\nmeta-learning. Experimental results show our methods outperform all baselines\nin appropriateness, diversity, and consistency with speakers.",

Most of previous studies adopted the self persona in\ndialogue whose response was about to be selected from a set of candidates or\ndirectly generated, but few have noticed the role of partner in dialogue. This\npaper makes an attempt to thoroughly explore the impact of utilizing personas\nthat describe either self or partner speakers on the task of response selection\nin retrieval-based chatbots. Four persona fusion strategies are designed, which\nassume personas interact with contexts or responses in different ways. These\nstrategies are implemented into three representative models for response\nselection, which are based on the Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder (HRE),\nInteractive Matching Network (IMN) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations\nfrom Transformers (BERT) respectively. Empirical studies on the Persona-Chat\ndataset show that the partner personas neglected in previous studies can\nimprove the accuracy of response selection in the IMN- and BERT-based models.\nBesides, our BERT-based model implemented with the context-response-aware\npersona fusion strategy outperforms previous methods by margins larger than\n2.7% on original personas and 4.6% on revised personas in terms of hits@1\n(top-1 accuracy), achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on the\nPersona-Chat dataset.",

Existing approaches are usually guided by the test coverage criteria,\ngenerating synthetic test cases that are often difficult for developers to read\nor understand. In this paper we propose AthenaTest, an approach that aims to\ngenerate unit test cases by learning from real-world focal methods and\ndeveloper-written testcases. We formulate unit test case generation as a\nsequence-to-sequence learning task, adopting a two-step training procedure\nconsisting of denoising pretraining on a large unsupervised Java corpus, and\nsupervised finetuning for a downstream translation task of generating unit\ntests. We investigate the impact of natural language and source code\npretraining, as well as the focal context information surrounding the focal\nmethod. Both techniques provide improvements in terms of validation loss, with\npretraining yielding 25% relative improvement and focal context providing\nadditional 11.1% improvement. We also introduce Methods2Test, the largest\npublicly available supervised parallel corpus of unit test case methods and\ncorresponding focal methods in Java, which comprises 780K test cases mined from\n91K open-source repositories from GitHub. We evaluate AthenaTest on five\ndefects4j projects, generating 25K passing test cases covering 43.7% of the\nfocal methods with only 30 attempts. We execute the test cases, collect test\ncoverage information, and compare them with test cases generated by EvoSuite\nand GPT-3, finding that our approach outperforms GPT-3 and has comparable\ncoverage w.r.t.

          "description": "Logical reasoning, which is closely related to human cognition, is of vital\nimportance in human's understanding of texts. Recent years have witnessed\nincreasing attentions on machine's logical reasoning abilities. However,\nprevious studies commonly apply ad-hoc methods to model pre-defined relation\npatterns, such as linking named entities, which only considers global knowledge\ncomponents that are related to commonsense, without local perception of\ncomplete facts or events. Such methodology is obviously insufficient to deal\nwith complicated logical structures. Therefore, we argue that the natural logic\nunits would be the group of backbone constituents of the sentence such as the\nsubject-verb-object formed \"facts\", covering both global and local knowledge\npieces that are necessary as the basis for logical reasoning. Beyond building\nthe ad-hoc graphs, we propose a more general and convenient fact-driven\napproach to construct a supergraph on top of our newly defined fact units, and\nenhance the supergraph with further explicit guidance of local question and\noption interactions. Experiments on two challenging logical reasoning benchmark\ndatasets, ReClor and LogiQA, show that our proposed model, \\textsc{Focal\nReasoner}, outperforms the baseline models dramatically. It can also be\nsmoothly applied to other downstream tasks such as MuTual, a dialogue reasoning\ndataset, achieving competitive results.",

In this task, given a series of natural language captions\nwhich compose a story, an agent must generate a sequence of images that\ncorrespond to the captions. Prior work has introduced recurrent generative\nmodels which outperform text-to-image synthesis models on this task. However,\nthere is room for improvement of generated images in terms of visual quality,\ncoherence and relevance. We present a number of improvements to prior modeling\napproaches, including (1) the addition of a dual learning framework that\nutilizes video captioning to reinforce the semantic alignment between the story\nand generated images, (2) a copy-transform mechanism for\nsequentially-consistent story visualization, and (3) MART-based transformers to\nmodel complex interactions between frames. We present ablation studies to\ndemonstrate the effect of each of these techniques on the generative power of\nthe model for both individual images as well as the entire narrative.\nFurthermore, due to the complexity and generative nature of the task, standard\nevaluation metrics do not accurately reflect performance.

          "description": "Probes are models devised to investigate the encoding of knowledge -- e.g.\nsyntactic structure -- in contextual representations. Probes are often designed\nfor simplicity, which has led to restrictions on probe design that may not\nallow for the full exploitation of the structure of encoded information; one\nsuch restriction is linearity. We examine the case of a structural probe\n(Hewitt and Manning, 2019), which aims to investigate the encoding of syntactic\nstructure in contextual representations through learning only linear\ntransformations. By observing that the structural probe learns a metric, we are\nable to kernelize it and develop a novel non-linear variant with an identical\nnumber of parameters. We test on 6 languages and find that the radial-basis\nfunction (RBF) kernel, in conjunction with regularization, achieves a\nstatistically significant improvement over the baseline in all languages --\nimplying that at least part of the syntactic knowledge is encoded non-linearly.\nWe conclude by discussing how the RBF kernel resembles BERT's self-attention\nlayers and speculate that this resemblance leads to the RBF-based probe's\nstronger performance.",

          "description": "General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) becomes a standard law for data\nprotection in many countries. Currently, twelve countries adopt the regulation\nand establish their GDPR-like regulation. However, to evaluate the differences\nand similarities of these GDPR-like regulations is time-consuming and needs a\nlot of manual effort from legal experts. Moreover, GDPR-like regulations from\ndifferent countries are written in their languages leading to a more difficult\ntask since legal experts who know both languages are essential. In this paper,\nwe investigate a simple natural language processing (NLP) approach to tackle\nthe problem. We first extract chunks of information from GDPR-like documents\nand form structured data from natural language. Next, we use NLP methods to\ncompare documents to measure their similarity. Finally, we manually label a\nsmall set of data to evaluate our approach. The empirical result shows that the\nBERT model with cosine similarity outperforms other baselines.

          "description": "End-to-end spoken language understanding (SLU) has recently attracted\nincreasing interest. Compared to the conventional tandem-based approach that\ncombines speech recognition and language understanding as separate modules, the\nnew approach extracts users' intentions directly from the speech signals,\nresulting in joint optimization and low latency. Such an approach, however, is\ntypically designed to process one intention at a time, which leads users to\ntake multiple rounds to fulfill their requirements while interacting with a\ndialogue system. In this paper, we propose a streaming end-to-end framework\nthat can process multiple intentions in an online and incremental way. The\nbackbone of our framework is a unidirectional RNN trained with the\nconnectionist temporal classification (CTC) criterion. By this design, an\nintention can be identified when sufficient evidence has been accumulated, and\nmultiple intentions can be identified sequentially. We evaluate our solution on\nthe Fluent Speech Commands (FSC) dataset and the intent detection accuracy is\nabout 97 % on all multi-intent settings. This result is comparable to the\nperformance of the state-of-the-art non-streaming models, but is achieved in an\nonline and incremental way. We also employ our model to a keyword spotting task\nusing the Google Speech Commands dataset and the results are also highly\npromising.",

However, as far as we know, due to completely abstain from sequence\ntagging mechanism, all prior span-based work fails to use token label\nin-formation. To solve this problem, we pro-pose Sequence Tagging enhanced\nSpan-based Network (STSN), a span-based joint extrac-tion network that is\nenhanced by token BIO label information derived from sequence tag-ging based\nNER. By stacking multiple atten-tion layers in depth, we design a deep neu-ral\narchitecture to build STSN, and each atten-tion layer consists of three basic\nattention units.

In this paper, observing distinctive error patterns\nand correction operations (i.e., insertion, deletion, and substitution) in ASR,\nwe propose FastCorrect, a novel NAR error correction model based on edit\nalignment. In training, FastCorrect aligns each source token from an ASR output\nsentence to the target tokens from the corresponding ground-truth sentence\nbased on the edit distance between the source and target sentences, and\nextracts the number of target tokens corresponding to each source token during\nedition/correction, which is then used to train a length predictor and to\nadjust the source tokens to match the length of the target sentence for\nparallel generation. In inference, the token number predicted by the length\npredictor is used to adjust the source tokens for target sequence generation.\nExperiments on the public AISHELL-1 dataset and an internal industrial-scale\nASR dataset show the effectiveness of FastCorrect for ASR error correction: 1)\nit speeds up the inference by 6-9 times and maintains the accuracy (8-14% WER\nreduction) compared with the autoregressive correction model; and 2) it\noutperforms the accuracy of popular NAR models adopted in neural machine\ntranslation by a large margin.",

We examine three strong generative models -- T5, BART, and\nGPT-2 -- and study whether their probabilities on QA tasks are well calibrated,\nfinding the answer is a relatively emphatic no. We then examine methods to\ncalibrate such models to make their confidence scores correlate better with the\nlikelihood of correctness through fine-tuning, post-hoc probability\nmodification, or adjustment of the predicted outputs or inputs. Experiments on\na diverse range of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

They can only\nutilize single-modal data (i.e. text or image) or limited multi-modal data\n(i.e. image-text pairs). In this work, we propose a unified-modal pre-training\narchitecture, namely UNIMO, which can effectively adapt to both single-modal\nand multi-modal understanding and generation tasks. Large scale of free text\ncorpus and image collections can be utilized to improve the capability of\nvisual and textual understanding, and cross-modal contrastive learning (CMCL)\nis leveraged to align the textual and visual information into a unified\nsemantic space over a corpus of image-text pairs. As the non-paired\nsingle-modal data is very rich, our model can utilize much larger scale of data\nto learn more generalizable representations. Moreover, the textual knowledge\nand visual knowledge can enhance each other in the unified semantic space.

          "description": "Human language has been described as a system that makes \\textit{use of\nfinite means to express an unlimited array of thoughts}. Of particular interest\nis the aspect of compositionality, whereby, the meaning of a compound language\nexpression can be deduced from the meaning of its constituent parts. If\nartificial agents can develop compositional communication protocols akin to\nhuman language, they can be made to seamlessly generalize to unseen\ncombinations. However, the real question is, how do we induce compositionality\nin emergent communication? Studies have recognized the role of curiosity in\nenabling linguistic development in children. It is this same intrinsic urge\nthat drives us to master complex tasks with decreasing amounts of explicit\nreward. In this paper, we seek to use this intrinsic feedback in inducing a\nsystematic and unambiguous protolanguage in artificial agents. We show how\nthese rewards can be leveraged in training agents to induce compositionality in\nabsence of any external feedback. Additionally, we introduce gComm, an\nenvironment for investigating grounded language acquisition in 2D-grid\nenvironments. Using this, we demonstrate how compositionality can enable agents\nto not only interact with unseen objects but also transfer skills from one task\nto another in a zero-shot setting: \\textit{Can an agent, trained to `pull' and\n`push twice', `pull twice'?}.",

          "description": "As more and more online search queries come from voice, automatic speech\nrecognition becomes a key component to deliver relevant search results. Errors\nintroduced by automatic speech recognition (ASR) lead to irrelevant search\nresults returned to the user, thus causing user dissatisfaction. In this paper,\nwe introduce an approach, Mondegreen, to correct voice queries in text space\nwithout depending on audio signals, which may not always be available due to\nsystem constraints or privacy or bandwidth (for example, some ASR systems run\non-device) considerations. We focus on voice queries transcribed via several\nproprietary commercial ASR systems. These queries come from users making\ninternet, or online service search queries. We first present an analysis\nshowing how different the language distribution coming from user voice queries\nis from that in traditional text corpora used to train off-the-shelf ASR\nsystems. We then demonstrate that Mondegreen can achieve significant\nimprovements in increased user interaction by correcting user voice queries in\none of the largest search systems in Google. Finally, we see Mondegreen as\ncomplementing existing highly-optimized production ASR systems, which may not\nbe frequently retrained and thus lag behind due to vocabulary drifts.",

          "description": "An emerging recipe for achieving state-of-the-art effectiveness in neural\ndocument re-ranking involves utilizing large pre-trained language models -\ne.g., BERT - to evaluate all individual passages in the document and then\naggregating the outputs by pooling or additional Transformer layers. A major\ndrawback of this approach is high query latency due to the cost of evaluating\nevery passage in the document with BERT. To make matters worse, this high\ninference cost and latency varies based on the length of the document, with\nlonger documents requiring more time and computation. To address this\nchallenge, we adopt an intra-document cascading strategy, which prunes passages\nof a candidate document using a less expensive model, called ESM, before\nrunning a scoring model that is more expensive and effective, called ETM. We\nfound it best to train ESM (short for Efficient Student Model) via knowledge\ndistillation from the ETM (short for Effective Teacher Model) e.g., BERT. This\npruning allows us to only run the ETM model on a smaller set of passages whose\nsize does not vary by document length. Our experiments on the MS MARCO and TREC\nDeep Learning Track benchmarks suggest that the proposed Intra-Document\nCascaded Ranking Model (IDCM) leads to over 400% lower query latency by\nproviding essentially the same effectiveness as the state-of-the-art BERT-based\ndocument ranking models.",

KLUE\nis a collection of 8 Korean natural language understanding (NLU) tasks,\nincluding Topic Classification, Semantic Textual Similarity, Natural Language\nInference, Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, Dependency Parsing,\nMachine Reading Comprehension, and Dialogue State Tracking. We build all of the\ntasks from scratch from diverse source corpora while respecting copyrights, to\nensure accessibility for anyone without any restrictions. With ethical\nconsiderations in mind, we carefully design annotation protocols. Along with\nthe benchmark tasks and data, we provide suitable evaluation metrics and\nfine-tuning recipes for pretrained language models for each task. We\nfurthermore release the pretrained language models (PLM), KLUE-BERT and\nKLUE-RoBERTa, to help reproduce baseline models on KLUE and thereby facilitate\nfuture research. We make a few interesting observations from the preliminary\nexperiments using the proposed KLUE benchmark suite, already demonstrating the\nusefulness of this new benchmark suite.

This problem has not only led to inaccurate evaluation,\nbut also made it hard to understand where we are and what's left to improve in\nthe research of DS-RE. To evaluate DS-RE models in a more credible way, we\nbuild manually-annotated test sets for two DS-RE datasets, NYT10 and Wiki20,\nand thoroughly evaluate several competitive models, especially the latest\npre-trained ones. The experimental results show that the manual evaluation can\nindicate very different conclusions from automatic ones, especially some\nunexpected observations, e.g., pre-trained models can achieve dominating\nperformance while being more susceptible to false-positives compared to\nprevious methods.

          "description": "Extensive research on target-dependent sentiment classification (TSC) has led\nto strong classification performances in domains where authors tend to\nexplicitly express sentiment about specific entities or topics, such as in\nreviews or on social media. We investigate TSC in news articles, a much less\nresearched domain, despite the importance of news as an essential information\nsource in individual and societal decision making. This article introduces\nNewsTSC, a manually annotated dataset to explore TSC on news articles.\nInvestigating characteristics of sentiment in news and contrasting them to\npopular TSC domains, we find that sentiment in the news is expressed less\nexplicitly, is more dependent on context and readership, and requires a greater\ndegree of interpretation. In an extensive evaluation, we find that the state of\nthe art in TSC performs worse on news articles than on other domains (average\nrecall AvgRec = 69.8 on NewsTSC compared to AvgRev = [75.6, 82.2] on\nestablished TSC datasets). Reasons include incorrectly resolved relation of\ntarget and sentiment-bearing phrases and off-context dependence. As a major\nimprovement over previous news TSC, we find that BERT's natural language\nunderstanding capabilities capture the less explicit sentiment used in news\narticles.",

          "description": "Distributional semantics has deeply changed in the last decades. First,\npredict models stole the thunder from traditional count ones, and more recently\nboth of them were replaced in many NLP applications by contextualized vectors\nproduced by Transformer neural language models. Although an extensive body of\nresearch has been devoted to Distributional Semantic Model (DSM) evaluation, we\nstill lack a thorough comparison with respect to tested models, semantic tasks,\nand benchmark datasets. Moreover, previous work has mostly focused on\ntask-driven evaluation, instead of exploring the differences between the way\nmodels represent the lexical semantic space. In this paper, we perform a\ncomprehensive evaluation of type distributional vectors, either produced by\nstatic DSMs or obtained by averaging the contextualized vectors generated by\nBERT. First of all, we investigate the performance of embeddings in several\nsemantic tasks, carrying out an in-depth statistical analysis to identify the\nmajor factors influencing the behavior of DSMs. The results show that i.) the\nalleged superiority of predict based models is more apparent than real, and\nsurely not ubiquitous and ii.) static DSMs surpass contextualized\nrepresentations in most out-of-context semantic tasks and datasets.\nFurthermore, we borrow from cognitive neuroscience the methodology of\nRepresentational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to inspect the semantic spaces\ngenerated by distributional models.

However,\nmany technologies such as Deep Learning and tools like Word Embeddings have\nstarted to be investigated only recently, and many challenges remain open when\nit comes to healthcare domain applications. To address these challenges, we\npropose the use of Deep Learning and Word Embeddings for identifying sixteen\nmorbidity types within textual descriptions of clinical records.

We have employed pre-trained\nWord Embeddings namely GloVe and Word2Vec, and our own Word Embeddings trained\non the target domain. Furthermore, we have compared the performances of the\ndeep learning approaches against the traditional tf-idf using Support Vector\nMachine and Multilayer perceptron (our baselines). From the obtained results it\nseems that the latter outperforms the combination of Deep Learning approaches\nusing any word embeddings.

          "description": "In recent years, abstractive text summarization with multimodal inputs has\nstarted drawing attention due to its ability to accumulate information from\ndifferent source modalities and generate a fluent textual summary. However,\nexisting methods use short videos as the visual modality and short summary as\nthe ground-truth, therefore, perform poorly on lengthy videos and long\nground-truth summary. Additionally, there exists no benchmark dataset to\ngeneralize this task on videos of varying lengths. In this paper, we introduce\nAVIATE, the first large-scale dataset for abstractive text summarization with\nvideos of diverse duration, compiled from presentations in well-known academic\nconferences like NDSS, ICML, NeurIPS, etc. We use the abstract of corresponding\nresearch papers as the reference summaries, which ensure adequate quality and\nuniformity of the ground-truth. We then propose {\\name}, a factorized\nmulti-modal Transformer based decoder-only language model, which inherently\ncaptures the intra-modal and inter-modal dynamics within various input\nmodalities for the text summarization task. {\\name} utilizes an increasing\nnumber of self-attentions to capture multimodality and performs significantly\nbetter than traditional encoder-decoder based networks. Extensive experiments\nillustrate that {\\name} achieves significant improvement over the baselines in\nboth qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the existing How2 dataset for\nshort videos and newly introduced AVIATE dataset for videos with diverse\nduration, beating the best baseline on the two datasets by $1.39$ and $2.74$\nROUGE-L points respectively.",

          "description": "Recent studies constructing direct interactions between the claim and each\nsingle user response (a comment or a relevant article) to capture evidence have\nshown remarkable success in interpretable claim verification. Owing to\ndifferent single responses convey different cognition of individual users\n(i.e., audiences), the captured evidence belongs to the perspective of\nindividual cognition. However, individuals' cognition of social things is not\nalways able to truly reflect the objective. There may be one-sided or biased\nsemantics in their opinions on a claim. The captured evidence correspondingly\ncontains some unobjective and biased evidence fragments, deteriorating task\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a Dual-view model based on the views of\nCollective and Individual Cognition (CICD) for interpretable claim\nverification. From the view of the collective cognition, we not only capture\nthe word-level semantics based on individual users, but also focus on\nsentence-level semantics (i.e., the overall responses) among all users and\nadjust the proportion between them to generate global evidence. From the view\nof individual cognition, we select the top-$k$ articles with high degree of\ndifference and interact with the claim to explore the local key evidence\nfragments. To weaken the bias of individual cognition-view evidence, we devise\ninconsistent loss to suppress the divergence between global and local evidence\nfor strengthening the consistent shared evidence between the both.

Hybrid recommender\nsystems combine multiple recommendation strategies in different ways to benefit\nfrom their complementary advantages. Some hybrid recommender systems have\ncombined collaborative filtering and content-based approaches to build systems\nthat are more robust. In this paper, we propose a hybrid recommender system,\nwhich combines Alternative Least Squares (ALS) based collaborative filtering\nwith deep learning to enhance recommendation performance as well as overcome\nthe limitations associated with the collaborative filtering approach,\nespecially concerning its cold start problem. In essence, we use the outputs\nfrom ALS (collaborative filtering) to influence the recommendations from a Deep\nNeural Network (DNN), which combines characteristic, contextual, structural and\nsequential information, in a big data processing framework.

          "description": "Recommender systems exploit interaction history to estimate user preference,\nhaving been heavily used in a wide range of industry applications. However,\nstatic recommendation models are difficult to answer two important questions\nwell due to inherent shortcomings: (a) What exactly does a user like? (b) Why\ndoes a user like an item? The shortcomings are due to the way that static\nmodels learn user preference, i.e., without explicit instructions and active\nfeedback from users. The recent rise of conversational recommender systems\n(CRSs) changes this situation fundamentally. In a CRS, users and the system can\ndynamically communicate through natural language interactions, which provide\nunprecedented opportunities to explicitly obtain the exact preference of users.\n\nConsiderable efforts, spread across disparate settings and applications, have\nbeen put into developing CRSs. Existing models, technologies, and evaluation\nmethods for CRSs are far from mature. In this paper, we provide a systematic\nreview of the techniques used in current CRSs. We summarize the key challenges\nof developing CRSs in five directions: (1) Question-based user preference\nelicitation. (2) Multi-turn conversational recommendation strategies. (3)\nDialogue understanding and generation. (4) Exploitation-exploration trade-offs.\n(5) Evaluation and user simulation. These research directions involve multiple\nresearch fields like information retrieval (IR), natural language processing\n(NLP), and human-computer interaction (HCI). Based on these research\ndirections, we discuss some future challenges and opportunities. We provide a\nroad map for researchers from multiple communities to get started in this area.\nWe hope this survey can help to identify and address challenges in CRSs and\ninspire future research.",

          "description": "InfoNCE loss is a widely used loss function for contrastive model training.\nIt aims to estimate the mutual information between a pair of variables by\ndiscriminating between each positive pair and its associated $K$ negative\npairs. It is proved that when the sample labels are clean, the lower bound of\nmutual information estimation is tighter when more negative samples are\nincorporated, which usually yields better model performance. However, in many\nreal-world tasks the labels often contain noise, and incorporating too many\nnoisy negative samples for model training may be suboptimal. In this paper, we\nstudy how many negative samples are optimal for InfoNCE in different scenarios\nvia a semi-quantitative theoretical framework. More specifically, we first\npropose a probabilistic model to analyze the influence of the negative sampling\nratio $K$ on training sample informativeness. Then, we design a training\neffectiveness function to measure the overall influence of training samples on\nmodel learning based on their informativeness. We estimate the optimal negative\nsampling ratio using the $K$ value that maximizes the training effectiveness\nfunction. Based on our framework, we further propose an adaptive negative\nsampling method that can dynamically adjust the negative sampling ratio to\nimprove InfoNCE based model training. Extensive experiments on different\nreal-world datasets show our framework can accurately predict the optimal\nnegative sampling ratio in different tasks, and our proposed adaptive negative\nsampling method can achieve better performance than the commonly used fixed\nnegative sampling ratio strategy.",

          "description": "In this paper a functionality taxonomy for document search engines is\nproposed. It can be used to assess the features of a search engine, to position\nsearch engines relative to each other, or to select which search engine 'fits'\na certain situation. One is able to identify areas for improvement. During\ndevelopment, we were guided by the viewpoint of the user. We use the word\n`search engine' in the broadest sense possible, including library and web based\n(meta) search engines. The taxonomy distinguishes seven functionality areas: an\nindexing service, user profiling, query composition, query execution, result\npresentation, result refinement, and history keeping. Each of these relates and\nprovides services to other functionality areas. It can be extended whenever\nnecessary. To illustrate the validity of our taxonomy, it has been used for\ncomparing various document search engines existing today (ACM Digital Library,\nPiCarta, Copernic, AltaVista, Google, and GuideBeam). It appears that the\nfunctionality aspects covered by our taxonomy can be used for describing these\nsearch engines.",

          "description": "Traditional industrial recommenders are usually trained on a single business\ndomain and then serve for this domain. However, in large commercial platforms,\nit is often the case that the recommenders need to make click-through rate\n(CTR) predictions for multiple business domains. Different domains have\noverlapping user groups and items. Thus, there exist commonalities. Since the\nspecific user groups have disparity and the user behaviors may change in\nvarious business domains, there also have distinctions. The distinctions result\nin domain-specific data distributions, making it hard for a single shared model\nto work well on all domains. To learn an effective and efficient CTR model to\nhandle multiple domains simultaneously, we present Star Topology Adaptive\nRecommender (STAR). Concretely, STAR has the star topology, which consists of\nthe shared centered parameters and domain-specific parameters. The shared\nparameters are applied to learn commonalities of all domains, and the\ndomain-specific parameters capture domain distinction for more refined\nprediction. Given requests from different business domains, STAR can adapt its\nparameters conditioned on the domain characteristics. The experimental result\nfrom production data validates the superiority of the proposed STAR model.\nSince 2020, STAR has been deployed in the display advertising system of\nAlibaba, obtaining averaging 8.0% improvement on CTR and 6.0% on RPM (Revenue\nPer Mille).",

          "description": "Fairness is an important property in data-mining applications, including\nrecommender systems. In this work, we investigate a case where users of a\nrecommender system need (or want) to be fair to a protected group of items. For\nexample, in a job market, the user is the recruiter, an item is the job seeker,\nand the protected attribute is gender or race. Even if recruiters want to use a\nfair talent recommender system, the platform may not provide a fair recommender\nsystem, or recruiters may not be able to ascertain whether the recommender\nsystem's algorithm is fair. In this case, recruiters cannot utilize the\nrecommender system, or they may become unfair to job seekers. In this work, we\npropose methods to enable the users to build their own fair recommender\nsystems. Our methods can generate fair recommendations even when the platform\ndoes not (or cannot) provide fair recommender systems. The key challenge is\nthat a user does not have access to the log data of other users or the latent\nrepresentations of items. This restriction prohibits us from adopting existing\nmethods, which are designed for platforms. The main idea is that a user has\naccess to unfair recommendations provided by the platform. Our methods leverage\nthe outputs of an unfair recommender system to construct a new fair recommender\nsystem. We empirically validate that our proposed method improves fairness\nsubstantially without harming much performance of the original unfair system.",

          "description": "Social media is becoming a primary medium to discuss what is happening around\nthe world. Therefore, the data generated by social media platforms contain rich\ninformation which describes the ongoing events. Further, the timeliness\nassociated with these data is capable of facilitating immediate insights.\nHowever, considering the dynamic nature and high volume of data production in\nsocial media data streams, it is impractical to filter the events manually and\ntherefore, automated event detection mechanisms are invaluable to the\ncommunity. Apart from a few notable exceptions, most previous research on\nautomated event detection have focused only on statistical and syntactical\nfeatures in data and lacked the involvement of underlying semantics which are\nimportant for effective information retrieval from text since they represent\nthe connections between words and their meanings. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel method termed Embed2Detect for event detection in social media by\ncombining the characteristics in word embeddings and hierarchical agglomerative\nclustering. The adoption of word embeddings gives Embed2Detect the capability\nto incorporate powerful semantical features into event detection and overcome a\nmajor limitation inherent in previous approaches. We experimented our method on\ntwo recent real social media data sets which represent the sports and political\ndomain and also compared the results to several state-of-the-art methods. The\nobtained results show that Embed2Detect is capable of effective and efficient\nevent detection and it outperforms the recent event detection methods. For the\nsports data set, Embed2Detect achieved 27% higher F-measure than the\nbest-performed baseline and for the political data set, it was an increase of\n29%.",

          "description": "Tremendous success of machine learning (ML) and the unabated growth in ML\nmodel complexity motivated many ML-specific designs in both CPU and accelerator\narchitectures to speed up the model inference. While these architectures are\ndiverse, highly optimized low-precision arithmetic is a component shared by\nmost. Impressive compute throughputs are indeed often exhibited by these\narchitectures on benchmark ML models. Nevertheless, production models such as\nrecommendation systems important to Facebook's personalization services are\ndemanding and complex: These systems must serve billions of users per month\nresponsively with low latency while maintaining high prediction accuracy,\nnotwithstanding computations with many tens of billions parameters per\ninference. Do these low-precision architectures work well with our production\nrecommendation systems? They do. But not without significant effort. We share\nin this paper our search strategies to adapt reference recommendation models to\nlow-precision hardware, our optimization of low-precision compute kernels, and\nthe design and development of tool chain so as to maintain our models' accuracy\nthroughout their lifespan during which topic trends and users' interests\ninevitably evolve. Practicing these low-precision technologies helped us save\ndatacenter capacities while deploying models with up to 5X complexity that\nwould otherwise not be deployed on traditional general-purpose CPUs.

          "description": "As users often express their preferences with binary behavior data~(implicit\nfeedback), such as clicking items or buying products, implicit feedback based\nCollaborative Filtering~(CF) models predict the top ranked items a user might\nlike by leveraging implicit user-item interaction data. For each user, the\nimplicit feedback is divided into two sets: an observed item set with limited\nobserved behaviors, and a large unobserved item set that is mixed with negative\nitem behaviors and unknown behaviors. Given any user preference prediction\nmodel, researchers either designed ranking based optimization goals or relied\non negative item mining techniques for better optimization. Despite the\nperformance gain of these implicit feedback based models, the recommendation\nresults are still far from satisfactory due to the sparsity of the observed\nitem set for each user. To this end, in this paper, we explore the unique\ncharacteristics of the implicit feedback and propose Set2setRank framework for\nrecommendation. The optimization criteria of Set2setRank are two folds: First,\nwe design an item to an item set comparison that encourages each observed item\nfrom the sampled observed set is ranked higher than any unobserved item from\nthe sampled unobserved set. Second, we model set level comparison that\nencourages a margin between the distance summarized from the observed item set\nand the most \"hard\" unobserved item from the sampled negative set. Further, an\nadaptive sampling technique is designed to implement these two goals. We have\nto note that our proposed framework is model-agnostic and can be easily applied\nto most recommendation prediction approaches, and is time efficient in\npractice. Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach.",

          "description": "A vital step towards the widespread adoption of neural retrieval models is\ntheir resource efficiency throughout the training, indexing and query\nworkflows. The neural IR community made great advancements in training\neffective dual-encoder dense retrieval (DR) models recently. A dense text\nretrieval model uses a single vector representation per query and passage to\nscore a match, which enables low-latency first stage retrieval with a nearest\nneighbor search. Increasingly common, training approaches require enormous\ncompute power, as they either conduct negative passage sampling out of a\ncontinuously updating refreshing index or require very large batch sizes for\nin-batch negative sampling. Instead of relying on more compute capability, we\nintroduce an efficient topic-aware query and balanced margin sampling\ntechnique, called TAS-Balanced. We cluster queries once before training and\nsample queries out of a cluster per batch. We train our lightweight 6-layer DR\nmodel with a novel dual-teacher supervision that combines pairwise and in-batch\nnegative teachers. Our method is trainable on a single consumer-grade GPU in\nunder 48 hours (as opposed to a common configuration of 8x V100s). We show that\nour TAS-Balanced training method achieves state-of-the-art low-latency (64ms\nper query) results on two TREC Deep Learning Track query sets. Evaluated on\nNDCG@10, we outperform BM25 by 44%, a plainly trained DR by 19%, docT5query by\n11%, and the previous best DR model by 5%. Additionally, TAS-Balanced produces\nthe first dense retriever that outperforms every other method on recall at any\ncutoff on TREC-DL and allows more resource intensive re-ranking models to\noperate on fewer passages to improve results further.",

One such important\ntarget group is formed by students, due to their usage of summaries in their\nstudy activities. For this reason, we investigate students' needs regarding\nautomatically generated summaries by means of a survey amongst university\nstudents and find that the current direction of the field does not fully align\nwith their needs. Motivated by our findings, we formulate three groups of\nimplications that together help us formulate a renewed perspective on future\nresearch on automatic summarization. First, the educational domain requires a\nbroader perspective on automatic summarization, beyond the approaches that are\ncurrently the standard. We illustrate how we can expand these approaches\nregarding the input material, the purpose of the summaries and their potential\nformat and we define requirements for datasets that can facilitate these\nresearch directions. Second, we propose a methodology to evaluate the\nusefulness of a summary based on the identified needs of a target group.

          "description": "The heavy traffic and related issues have always been concerns for modern\ncities. With the help of deep learning and reinforcement learning, people have\nproposed various policies to solve these traffic-related problems, such as\nsmart traffic signal control systems and taxi dispatching systems. People\nusually validate these policies in a city simulator, since directly applying\nthem in the real city introduces real cost. However, these policies validated\nin the city simulator may fail in the real city if the simulator is\nsignificantly different from the real world. To tackle this problem, we need to\nbuild a real-like traffic simulation system. Therefore, in this paper, we\npropose to learn the human routing model, which is one of the most essential\npart in the traffic simulator. This problem has two major challenges. First,\nhuman routing decisions are determined by multiple factors, besides the common\ntime and distance factor. Second, current historical routes data usually covers\njust a small portion of vehicles, due to privacy and device availability\nissues. To address these problems, we propose a theory-guided residual network\nmodel, where the theoretical part can emphasize the general principles for\nhuman routing decisions (e.g., fastest route), and the residual part can\ncapture drivable condition preferences (e.g., local road or highway). Since the\ntheoretical part is composed of traditional shortest path algorithms that do\nnot need data to train, our residual network can learn human routing models\nfrom limited data. We have conducted extensive experiments on multiple\nreal-world datasets to show the superior performance of our model, especially\nwith small data. Besides, we have also illustrated why our model is better at\nrecovering real routes through case studies.",

          "description": "Synonymous keyword retrieval has become an important problem for sponsored\nsearch ever since major search engines relax the exact match product's matching\nrequirement to a synonymous level. Since the synonymous relations between\nqueries and keywords are quite scarce, the traditional information retrieval\nframework is inefficient in this scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel\nquotient space-based retrieval framework to address this problem. Considering\nthe synonymy among keywords as a mathematical equivalence relation, we can\ncompress the synonymous keywords into one representative, and the corresponding\nquotient space would greatly reduce the size of the keyword repository. Then an\nembedding-based retrieval is directly conducted between queries and the keyword\nrepresentatives. To mitigate the semantic gap of the quotient space-based\nretrieval, a single semantic siamese model is utilized to detect both the\nkeyword--keyword and query-keyword synonymous relations. The experiments show\nthat with our quotient space-based retrieval method, the synonymous keyword\nretrieving performance can be greatly improved in terms of memory cost and\nrecall efficiency. This method has been successfully implemented in Baidu's\nonline sponsored search system and has yielded a significant improvement in\nrevenue.",

Generic information\nextraction (IE) models used to populate the knowledge graph cannot fully\nguarantee domain-specific context. This paper proposes a system to generate a\nMalware Knowledge Graph called MalKG, the first open-source automated knowledge\ngraph for malware threat intelligence. MalKG dataset (MT40K\\footnote{ Anonymous\nGitHub link: https://github.com/malkg-researcher/MalKG}) contains approximately\n40,000 triples generated from 27,354 unique entities and 34 relations. For\nground truth, we manually curate a knowledge graph called MT3K, with 3,027\ntriples generated from 5,741 unique entities and 22 relations. We demonstrate\nthe intelligence prediction of MalKG using two use cases. Predicting malware\nthreat information using the benchmark model achieves 80.4 for the hits@10\nmetric (predicts the top 10 options for an information class), and 0.75 for the\nMRR (mean reciprocal rank).

          "description": "With the increasing scale and diversification of interaction behaviors in\nE-commerce, more and more researchers pay attention to multi-behavior\nrecommender systems that utilize interaction data of other auxiliary behaviors\nsuch as view and cart. To address these challenges in heterogeneous scenarios,\nnon-sampling methods have shown superiority over negative sampling methods.\nHowever, two observations are usually ignored in existing state-of-the-art\nnon-sampling methods based on binary regression: (1) users have different\npreference strengths for different items, so they cannot be measured simply by\nbinary implicit data; (2) the dependency across multiple behaviors varies for\ndifferent users and items. To tackle the above issue, we propose a novel\nnon-sampling learning framework named \\underline{C}riterion-guided\n\\underline{H}eterogeneous \\underline{C}ollaborative \\underline{F}iltering\n(CHCF).

We\nfurther theoretically demonstrate that the optimization of Collaborative Metric\nLearning can be approximately achieved by CHCF learning framework in a\nnon-sampling form effectively.

In the first\nstage, a number of potentially relevant candidates are retrieved using an\nefficient retrieval model such as BM25. Although BM25 has proven decent\nperformance as a first-stage ranker, it tends to miss relevant passages. In\nthis context we propose CoRT, a simple neural first-stage ranking model that\nleverages contextual representations from pretrained language models such as\nBERT to complement term-based ranking functions while causing no significant\ndelay at query time. Using the MS MARCO dataset, we show that CoRT\nsignificantly increases the candidate recall by complementing BM25 with missing\ncandidates.

          "description": "Existing topic modeling and text segmentation methodologies generally require\nlarge datasets for training, limiting their capabilities when only small\ncollections of text are available. In this work, we reexamine the inter-related\nproblems of \"topic identification\" and \"text segmentation\" for sparse document\nlearning, when there is a single new text of interest. In developing a\nmethodology to handle single documents, we face two major challenges. First is\nsparse information: with access to only one document, we cannot train\ntraditional topic models or deep learning algorithms. Second is significant\nnoise: a considerable portion of words in any single document will produce only\nnoise and not help discern topics or segments. To tackle these issues, we\ndesign an unsupervised, computationally efficient methodology called BATS:\nBiclustering Approach to Topic modeling and Segmentation. BATS leverages three\nkey ideas to simultaneously identify topics and segment text: (i) a new\nmechanism that uses word order information to reduce sample complexity, (ii) a\nstatistically sound graph-based biclustering technique that identifies latent\nstructures of words and sentences, and (iii) a collection of effective\nheuristics that remove noise words and award important words to further improve\nperformance. Experiments on four datasets show that our approach outperforms\nseveral state-of-the-art baselines when considering topic coherence, topic\ndiversity, segmentation, and runtime comparison metrics.",

          "description": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective technique for training\ndecision-making agents through interactions with their environment. The advent\nof deep learning has been associated with highly notable successes with\nsequential decision making problems - such as defeating some of the\nhighest-ranked human players at Go. In digital advertising, real-time bidding\n(RTB) is a common method of allocating advertising inventory through real-time\nauctions. Bidding strategies need to incorporate logic for dynamically\nadjusting parameters in order to deliver pre-assigned campaign goals. Here we\ndiscuss techniques toward using RL to train bidding agents. As a campaign\nmetric we particularly focused on viewability: the percentage of inventory\nwhich goes on to be viewed by an end user.\n\nThis paper is presented as a survey of techniques and experiments which we\ndeveloped through the course of this research. We discuss expanding our\ntraining data to include edge cases by training on simulated interactions. We\ndiscuss the experimental results comparing the performance of several promising\nRL algorithms, and an approach to hyperparameter optimization of an\nactor/critic training pipeline through Bayesian optimization. Finally, we\npresent live-traffic tests of some of our RL agents against a rule-based\nfeedback-control approach, demonstrating the potential for this method as well\nas areas for further improvement. This paper therefore presents an arrangement\nof our findings in this quickly developing field, and ways that it can be\napplied to an RTB use case.",

          "description": "Recommender systems usually amplify the biases in the data. The model learned\nfrom historical interactions with imbalanced item distribution will amplify the\nimbalance by over-recommending items from the major groups. Addressing this\nissue is essential for a healthy ecosystem of recommendation in the long run.\nExisting works apply bias control to the ranking targets (e.g., calibration,\nfairness, and diversity), but ignore the true reason for bias amplification and\ntrade-off the recommendation accuracy.\n\nIn this work, we scrutinize the cause-effect factors for bias amplification,\nidentifying the main reason lies in the confounder effect of imbalanced item\ndistribution on user representation and prediction score. The existence of such\nconfounder pushes us to go beyond merely modeling the conditional probability\nand embrace the causal modeling for recommendation. Towards this end, we\npropose a Deconfounded Recommender System (DecRS), which models the causal\neffect of user representation on the prediction score. The key to eliminating\nthe impact of the confounder lies in backdoor adjustment, which is however\ndifficult to do due to the infinite sample space of the confounder. For this\nchallenge, we contribute an approximation operator for backdoor adjustment\nwhich can be easily plugged into most recommender models. Lastly, we devise an\ninference strategy to dynamically regulate backdoor adjustment according to\nuser status. We instantiate DecRS on two representative models FM and NFM, and\nconduct extensive experiments over two benchmarks to validate the superiority\nof our proposed DecRS.",

          "description": "Deep matching models aim to facilitate search engines retrieving more\nrelevant documents by mapping queries and documents into semantic vectors in\nthe first-stage retrieval. When leveraging BERT as the deep matching model, the\nattention score across two words are solely built upon local contextualized\nword embeddings. It lacks prior global knowledge to distinguish the importance\nof different words, which has been proved to play a critical role in\ninformation retrieval tasks. In addition to this, BERT only performs attention\nacross sub-words tokens which weakens whole word attention representation. We\npropose a novel Global Weighted Self-Attention (GLOW) network for web document\nsearch. GLOW fuses global corpus statistics into the deep matching model. By\nadding prior weights into attention generation from global information, like\nBM25, GLOW successfully learns weighted attention scores jointly with query\nmatrix $Q$ and key matrix $K$. We also present an efficient whole word weight\nsharing solution to bring prior whole word knowledge into sub-words level\nattention. It aids Transformer to learn whole word level attention. To make our\nmodels applicable to complicated web search scenarios, we introduce combined\nfields representation to accommodate documents with multiple fields even with\nvariable number of instances. We demonstrate GLOW is more efficient to capture\nthe topical and semantic representation both in queries and documents.\nIntrinsic evaluation and experiments conducted on public data sets reveal GLOW\nto be a general framework for document retrieve task.

          "description": "Recommendation is a prevalent and critical service in information systems. To\nprovide personalized suggestions to users, industry players embrace machine\nlearning, more specifically, building predictive models based on the click\nbehavior data. This is known as the Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, which\nhas become the gold standard for building personalized recommendation service.\nHowever, we argue that there is a significant gap between clicks and user\nsatisfaction -- it is common that a user is \"cheated\" to click an item by the\nattractive title/cover of the item. This will severely hurt user's trust on the\nsystem if the user finds the actual content of the clicked item disappointing.\nWhat's even worse, optimizing CTR models on such flawed data will result in the\nMatthew Effect, making the seemingly attractive but actually low-quality items\nbe more frequently recommended.\n\nIn this paper, we formulate the recommendation models as a causal graph that\nreflects the cause-effect factors in recommendation, and address the clickbait\nissue by performing counterfactual inference on the causal graph. We imagine a\ncounterfactual world where each item has only exposure features (i.e., the\nfeatures that the user can see before making a click decision). By estimating\nthe click likelihood of a user in the counterfactual world, we are able to\nreduce the direct effect of exposure features and eliminate the clickbait\nissue.

          "description": "In most real-world large-scale online applications (e.g., e-commerce or\nfinance), customer acquisition is usually a multi-step conversion process of\naudiences. For example, an impression->click->purchase process is usually\nperformed of audiences for e-commerce platforms. However, it is more difficult\nto acquire customers in financial advertising (e.g., credit card advertising)\nthan in traditional advertising. On the one hand, the audience multi-step\nconversion path is longer. On the other hand, the positive feedback is sparser\n(class imbalance) step by step, and it is difficult to obtain the final\npositive feedback due to the delayed feedback of activation. Multi-task\nlearning is a typical solution in this direction. While considerable multi-task\nefforts have been made in this direction, a long-standing challenge is how to\nexplicitly model the long-path sequential dependence among audience multi-step\nconversions for improving the end-to-end conversion. In this paper, we propose\nan Adaptive Information Transfer Multi-task (AITM) framework, which models the\nsequential dependence among audience multi-step conversions via the Adaptive\nInformation Transfer (AIT) module. The AIT module can adaptively learn what and\nhow much information to transfer for different conversion stages. Besides, by\ncombining the Behavioral Expectation Calibrator in the loss function, the AITM\nframework can yield more accurate end-to-end conversion identification. The\nproposed framework is deployed in Meituan app, which utilizes it to real-timely\nshow a banner to the audience with a high end-to-end conversion rate for\nMeituan Co-Branded Credit Cards. Offline experimental results on both\nindustrial and public real-world datasets clearly demonstrate that the proposed\nframework achieves significantly better performance compared with\nstate-of-the-art baselines.",

          "description": "Learning to rank is a key component of many e-commerce search engines. In\nlearning to rank, one is interested in optimising the global ordering of a list\nof items according to their utility for users.Popular approaches learn a\nscoring function that scores items individually (i.e. without the context of\nother items in the list) by optimising a pointwise, pairwise or listwise loss.\nThe list is then sorted in the descending order of the scores. Possible\ninteractions between items present in the same list are taken into account in\nthe training phase at the loss level. However, during inference, items are\nscored individually, and possible interactions between them are not considered.\nIn this paper, we propose a context-aware neural network model that learns item\nscores by applying a self-attention mechanism. The relevance of a given item is\nthus determined in the context of all other items present in the list, both in\ntraining and in inference. We empirically demonstrate significant performance\ngains of self-attention based neural architecture over Multi-LayerPerceptron\nbaselines, in particular on a dataset coming from search logs of a large scale\ne-commerce marketplace, Allegro.pl.

          "description": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is critical for industrial recommender\nsystems, where most deep CTR models follow an Embedding \\& Feature Interaction\nparadigm. However, the majority of methods focus on designing network\narchitectures to better capture feature interactions while the feature\nembedding, especially for numerical features, has been overlooked. Existing\napproaches for numerical features are difficult to capture informative\nknowledge because of the low capacity or hard discretization based on the\noffline expertise feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a novel\nembedding learning framework for numerical features in CTR prediction (AutoDis)\nwith high model capacity, end-to-end training and unique representation\nproperties preserved. AutoDis consists of three core components:\nmeta-embeddings, automatic discretization and aggregation. Specifically, we\npropose meta-embeddings for each numerical field to learn global knowledge from\nthe perspective of field with a manageable number of parameters. Then the\ndifferentiable automatic discretization performs soft discretization and\ncaptures the correlations between the numerical features and meta-embeddings.\nFinally, distinctive and informative embeddings are learned via an aggregation\nfunction. Comprehensive experiments on two public and one industrial datasets\nare conducted to validate the effectiveness of AutoDis. Moreover, AutoDis has\nbeen deployed onto a mainstream advertising platform, where online A/B test\ndemonstrates the improvement over the base model by 2.1% and 2.7% in terms of\nCTR and eCPM, respectively. In addition, the code of our framework is publicly\navailable in\nMindSpore(https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/tree/master/model_zoo/research/recommend/autodis).",

          "description": "Sequential recommendation techniques provide users with product\nrecommendations fitting their current preferences by handling dynamic user\npreferences over time. Previous studies have focused on modeling sequential\ndynamics without much regard to which of the best-selling products (i.e., head\nitems) or niche products (i.e., tail items) should be recommended. We\nscrutinize the structural reason for why tail items are barely served in the\ncurrent sequential recommendation model, which consists of an item-embedding\nlayer, a sequence-modeling layer, and a recommendation layer. Well-designed\nsequence-modeling and recommendation layers are expected to naturally learn\nsuitable item embeddings. However, tail items are likely to fall short of this\nexpectation because the current model structure is not suitable for learning\nhigh-quality embeddings with insufficient data. Thus, tail items are rarely\nrecommended. To eliminate this issue, we propose a framework called CITIES,\nwhich aims to enhance the quality of the tail-item embeddings by training an\nembedding-inference function using multiple contextual head items so that the\nrecommendation performance improves for not only the tail items but also for\nthe head items. Moreover, our framework can infer new-item embeddings without\nan additional learning process. Extensive experiments on two real-world\ndatasets show that applying CITIES to the state-of-the-art methods improves\nrecommendation performance for both tail and head items. We conduct an\nadditional experiment to verify that CITIES can infer suitable new-item\nembeddings as well.",

          "description": "Learning to Rank (LTR) algorithms are usually evaluated using Information\nRetrieval metrics like Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) or Mean\nAverage Precision. As these metrics rely on sorting predicted items' scores\n(and thus, on items' ranks), their derivatives are either undefined or zero\neverywhere. This makes them unsuitable for gradient-based optimisation, which\nis the usual method of learning appropriate scoring functions. Commonly used\nLTR loss functions are only loosely related to the evaluation metrics, causing\na mismatch between the optimisation objective and the evaluation criterion. In\nthis paper, we address this mismatch by proposing NeuralNDCG, a novel\ndifferentiable approximation to NDCG. Since NDCG relies on the\nnon-differentiable sorting operator, we obtain NeuralNDCG by relaxing that\noperator using NeuralSort, a differentiable approximation of sorting. As a\nresult, we obtain a new ranking loss function which is an arbitrarily accurate\napproximation to the evaluation metric, thus closing the gap between the\ntraining and the evaluation of LTR models. We introduce two variants of the\nproposed loss function. Finally, the empirical evaluation shows that our\nproposed method outperforms previous work aimed at direct optimisation of NDCG\nand is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods.",

First, unlike traditional\naggregated web search that merely presents multi-sourced results in the first\npage, this new task may present aggregated results in all pages and has to\ndynamically decide which source should be presented in the current page.\nSecond, as pointed out by many existing studies, it is not trivial to rank\nitems from heterogeneous sources because the relevance scores from different\nsource systems are not directly comparable. To address these two issues, we\ndecompose the task into two subtasks in a hierarchical structure: a high-level\ntask for source selection where we model the sequential patterns of user\nbehaviors onto aggregated results in different pages so as to understand user\nintents and select the relevant sources properly; and a low-level task for item\npresentation where we formulate a slot filling process to sequentially present\nthe items instead of giving each item a relevance score when deciding the\npresentation order of heterogeneous items. Since both subtasks can be naturally\nformulated as sequential decision problems and learn from the future user\nfeedback on search results, we build our model with hierarchical reinforcement\nlearning.

          "description": "As the heart of a search engine, the ranking system plays a crucial role in\nsatisfying users' information demands. More recently, neural rankers fine-tuned\nfrom pre-trained language models (PLMs) establish state-of-the-art ranking\neffectiveness. However, it is nontrivial to directly apply these PLM-based\nrankers to the large-scale web search system due to the following challenging\nissues:(1) the prohibitively expensive computations of massive neural PLMs,\nespecially for long texts in the web-document, prohibit their deployments in an\nonline ranking system that demands extremely low latency;(2) the discrepancy\nbetween existing ranking-agnostic pre-training objectives and the ad-hoc\nretrieval scenarios that demand comprehensive relevance modeling is another\nmain barrier for improving the online ranking system;(3) a real-world search\nengine typically involves a committee of ranking components, and thus the\ncompatibility of the individually fine-tuned ranking model is critical for a\ncooperative ranking system. In this work, we contribute a series of\nsuccessfully applied techniques in tackling these exposed issues when deploying\nthe state-of-the-art Chinese pre-trained language model, i.e., ERNIE, in the\nonline search engine system.

Then we endow an innovative paradigm to finely exploit the\nlarge-scale noisy and biased post-click behavioral data for relevance-oriented\npre-training.

It\nallows searching for various powerful feature interactions to produce higher\nAUC and lower Logloss in a wide variety of applications. Besides, AutoPI\nutilizes a gradient-based search strategy for exploration with a significantly\nlow computational cost.

          "description": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in many\nindustrial applications, and recently a lot of attention is paid to the deep\ninterest models which use attention mechanism to capture user interests from\nhistorical behaviors. However, most current models are based on sequential\nmodels which truncate the behavior sequences by a fixed length, thus have\ndifficulties in handling very long behavior sequences. Another big problem is\nthat sequences with the same length can be quite different in terms of time,\ncarrying completely different meanings. In this paper, we propose a\nnon-sequential approach to tackle the above problems. Specifically, we first\nrepresent the behavior data in a sparse key-vector format, where the vector\ncontains rich behavior info such as time, count and category. Next, we enhance\nthe Deep Interest Network to take such rich information into account by a novel\nattention network. The sparse representation makes it practical to handle large\nscale long behavior sequences. Finally, we introduce a multidimensional\npartition framework to mine behavior interactions. The framework can partition\ndata into custom designed time buckets to capture the interactions among\ninformation aggregated in different time buckets. Similarly, it can also\npartition the data into different categories and capture the interactions among\nthem.

          "description": "In recent years, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has been\napplied to improve numerous processes, such as inventory management in retail\nstores. However, automatic localization of RFID-tagged goods in stores is still\na challenging problem. To address this issue, we equip fixtures (e.g., shelves)\nwith reference tags and use data we collect during RFID-based stocktakes to map\narticles to fixtures. Knowing the location of goods enables the implementation\nof several practical applications, such as automated Money Mapping (i.e., a\nheat map of sales across fixtures). Specifically, we conduct controlled lab\nexperiments and a case-study in two fashion retail stores to evaluate our\narticle-to-fixture prediction approaches. The approaches are based on\ncalculating distances between read event time series using DTW, and clustering\nof read events using DBSCAN. We find that, read events collected during\nRFID-based stocktakes can be used to assign articles to fixtures with an\naccuracy of more than 90%. Additionally, we conduct a pilot to investigate the\nchallenges related to the integration of such a localization system in the\nday-to-day business of retail stores. Hence, in this paper we present an\nexploratory venture into novel and practical RFID-based applications in fashion\nretails stores, beyond the scope of stock management.",

To address this problem, we introduce a novel method by\nadapting the Simpson's Diversity Index from biology, which enables a more\neffective and efficient quadratic search result diversification algorithm. We\nalso extend the method to balance the diversity between multiple aspects\nthrough weighted factors and further improve computational complexity by\ndeveloping a fast approximation algorithm.

          "description": "The performance of a cross-sectional currency strategy depends crucially on\naccurately ranking instruments prior to portfolio construction. While this\nranking step is traditionally performed using heuristics, or by sorting outputs\nproduced by pointwise regression or classification models, Learning to Rank\nalgorithms have recently presented themselves as competitive and viable\nalternatives. Despite improving ranking accuracy on average however, these\ntechniques do not account for the possibility that assets positioned at the\nextreme ends of the ranked list -- which are ultimately used to construct the\nlong/short portfolios -- can assume different distributions in the input space,\nand thus lead to sub-optimal strategy performance. Drawing from research in\nInformation Retrieval that demonstrates the utility of contextual information\nembedded within top-ranked documents to learn the query's characteristics to\nimprove ranking, we propose an analogous approach: exploiting the features of\nboth out- and under-performing instruments to learn a model for refining the\noriginal ranked list. Under a re-ranking framework, we adapt the Transformer\narchitecture to encode the features of extreme assets for refining our\nselection of long/short instruments obtained with an initial retrieval.\nBacktesting on a set of 31 currencies, our proposed methodology significantly\nboosts Sharpe ratios -- by approximately 20% over the original LTR algorithms\nand double that of traditional baselines.",

          "description": "To support complex search tasks, where the initial information requirements\nare complex or may change during the search, a search engine must adapt the\ninformation delivery as the user's information requirements evolve. To support\nthis dynamic ranking paradigm effectively, search result ranking must\nincorporate both the user feedback received, and the information displayed so\nfar. To address this problem, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning-based\napproach, RLIrank. We first build an adapted reinforcement learning framework\nto integrate the key components of the dynamic search. Then, we implement a new\nLearning to Rank (LTR) model for each iteration of the dynamic search, using a\nrecurrent Long Short Term Memory neural network (LSTM), which estimates the\ngain for each next result, learning from each previously ranked document. To\nincorporate the user's feedback, we develop a word-embedding variation of the\nclassic Rocchio Algorithm, to help guide the ranking towards the high-value\ndocuments. Those innovations enable RLIrank to outperform the previously\nreported methods from the TREC Dynamic Domain Tracks 2017 and exceed all the\nmethods in 2016 TREC Dynamic Domain after multiple search iterations, advancing\nthe state of the art for dynamic search.",

          "description": "Users' clicks on Web search results are one of the key signals for evaluating\nand improving web search quality and have been widely used as part of current\nstate-of-the-art Learning-To-Rank(LTR) models. With a large volume of search\nlogs available for major search engines, effective models of searcher click\nbehavior have emerged to evaluate and train LTR models. However, when modeling\nthe users' click behavior, considering the bias of the behavior is imperative.\nIn particular, when a search result is not clicked, it is not necessarily\nchosen as not relevant by the user, but instead could have been simply missed,\nespecially for lower-ranked results. These kinds of biases in the click log\ndata can be incorporated into the click models, propagating the errors to the\nresulting LTR ranking models or evaluation metrics. In this paper, we propose\nthe De-biased Reinforcement Learning Click model (DRLC). The DRLC model relaxes\npreviously made assumptions about the users' examination behavior and resulting\nlatent states. To implement the DRLC model, convolutional neural networks are\nused as the value networks for reinforcement learning, trained to learn a\npolicy to reduce bias in the click logs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe DRLC model, we first compare performance with the previous state-of-art\napproaches using established click prediction metrics, including log-likelihood\nand perplexity. We further show that DRLC also leads to improvements in ranking\nperformance. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRLC model in\nlearning to reduce bias in click logs, leading to improved modeling performance\nand showing the potential for using DRLC for improving Web search quality.",

          "description": "Recommender systems (RSs) are software tools and algorithms developed to\nalleviate the problem of information overload, which makes it difficult for a\nuser to make right decisions. Two main paradigms toward the recommendation\nproblem are collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, which try to\nrecommend the best items using ratings and content available. These methods\ntypically face infamous problems including cold-start, diversity, scalability,\nand great computational expense. We argue that the uptake of deep learning and\nreinforcement learning methods is also questionable due to their computational\ncomplexities and uninterpretability. In this paper, we approach the\nrecommendation problem from a new prospective. We borrow ideas from cluster\nhead selection algorithms in wireless sensor networks and adapt them to the\nrecommendation problem. In particular, we propose Load Balanced Recommender\nSystem (LBRS), which uses a probabilistic scheme for item recommendation.\nFurthermore, we factor in the importance of items in the recommendation\nprocess, which significantly improves the recommendation accuracy. We also\nintroduce a method that considers a heterogeneity among items, in order to\nbalance the similarity and diversity trade-off. Finally, we propose a new\nmetric for diversity, which emphasizes the importance of diversity not only\nfrom an intra-list perspective, but also from a between-list point of view.\nWith experiments in a simulation study performed on RecSim, we show that LBRS\nis effective and can outperform baseline methods.",

In this scenario, user's behavior evolves from single click\nbehavior to multiple behaviors including like, comment, share etc. However,\nmost of the existing methods still use single click behavior as the unique\ncriterion of judging user's preferences. Further, although heterogeneous graphs\nhave been applied in different areas, a proper way to construct a heterogeneous\ngraph for interactive news data with an appropriate learning mechanism on it is\nstill desired. To address the above concerns, we propose a graph-based\nbehavior-aware network, which simultaneously considers six different types of\nbehaviors as well as user's demand on the news diversity. We have three main\nsteps. First, we build an interaction behavior graph for multi-level and\nmulti-category data. Second, we apply DeepWalk on the behavior graph to obtain\nentity semantics, then build a graph-based convolutional neural network called\nG-CNN to learn news representations, and an attention-based LSTM to learn\nbehavior sequence representations. Third, we introduce core and coritivity\nfeatures for the behavior graph, which measure the concentration degree of\nuser's interests. These features affect the trade-off between accuracy and\ndiversity of our personalized recommendation system. Taking these features into\naccount, our system finally achieves recommending news to different users at\ntheir different levels of concentration degrees.",

          "description": "Conversational recommender systems (CRS) enable the traditional recommender\nsystems to explicitly acquire user preferences towards items and attributes\nthrough interactive conversations. Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely\nadopted to learn conversational recommendation policies to decide what\nattributes to ask, which items to recommend, and when to ask or recommend, at\neach conversation turn. However, existing methods mainly target at solving one\nor two of these three decision-making problems in CRS with separated\nconversation and recommendation components, which restrict the scalability and\ngenerality of CRS and fall short of preserving a stable training procedure. In\nthe light of these challenges, we propose to formulate these three\ndecision-making problems in CRS as a unified policy learning task. In order to\nsystematically integrate conversation and recommendation components, we develop\na dynamic weighted graph based RL method to learn a policy to select the action\nat each conversation turn, either asking an attribute or recommending items.\nFurther, to deal with the sample efficiency issue, we propose two action\nselection strategies for reducing the candidate action space according to the\npreference and entropy information. Experimental results on two benchmark CRS\ndatasets and a real-world E-Commerce application show that the proposed method\nnot only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also enhances\nthe scalability and stability of CRS.",

          "description": "Effective information disclosure in the context of databases with a large\nconceptual schema is known to be a non-trivial problem. In particular the\nformulation of ad-hoc queries is a major problem in such contexts. Existing\napproaches for tackling this problem include graphical query interfaces, query\nby navigation, query by construction, and point to point queries. In this\nreport we propose an adoption of the query by navigation mechanism that is\nespecially geared towards the InfoAssistant product. Query by navigation is\nbased on ideas from the information retrieval world, in particular on the\nstratified hypermedia architecture. When using our approach to the formulations\nof queries, a user will first formulate a number of simple queries\ncorresponding to linear paths through the information structure. The\nformulation of the linear paths is the result of the {\\em explorative phase} of\nthe query formulation. Once users have specified a number of these linear\npaths, they may combine them to form more complex queries. Examples of such\ncombinations are: concatenation, union, intersection and selection. This last\nprocess is referred to as {\\em query by construction}, and is the {\\em\nconstructive phase} of the query formulation process.",

          "description": "Due to the importance of the lower bounding distances and the attractiveness\nof symbolic representations, the family of symbolic aggregate approximations\n(SAX) has been used extensively for encoding time series data. However, typical\nSAX-based methods rely on two restrictive assumptions; the Gaussian\ndistribution and equiprobable symbols. This paper proposes two novel\ndata-driven SAX-based symbolic representations, distinguished by their\ndiscretization steps. The first representation, oriented for general data\ncompaction and indexing scenarios, is based on the combination of kernel\ndensity estimation and Lloyd-Max quantization to minimize the information loss\nand mean squared error in the discretization step. The second method, oriented\nfor high-level mining tasks, employs the Mean-Shift clustering method and is\nshown to enhance anomaly detection in the lower-dimensional space. Besides, we\nverify on a theoretical basis a previously observed phenomenon of the intrinsic\nprocess that results in a lower than the expected variance of the intermediate\npiecewise aggregate approximation. This phenomenon causes an additional\ninformation loss but can be avoided with a simple modification. The proposed\nrepresentations possess all the attractive properties of the conventional SAX\nmethod. Furthermore, experimental evaluation on real-world datasets\ndemonstrates their superiority compared to the traditional SAX and an\nalternative data-driven SAX variant.",

          "description": "Recommender systems are gaining increasing and critical impacts on human and\nsociety since a growing number of users use them for information seeking and\ndecision making. Therefore, it is crucial to address the potential unfairness\nproblems in recommendations. Just like users have personalized preferences on\nitems, users' demands for fairness are also personalized in many scenarios.\nTherefore, it is important to provide personalized fair recommendations for\nusers to satisfy their personalized fairness demands. Besides, previous works\non fair recommendation mainly focus on association-based fairness. However, it\nis important to advance from associative fairness notions to causal fairness\nnotions for assessing fairness more properly in recommender systems. Based on\nthe above considerations, this paper focuses on achieving personalized\ncounterfactual fairness for users in recommender systems. To this end, we\nintroduce a framework for achieving counterfactually fair recommendations\nthrough adversary learning by generating feature-independent user embeddings\nfor recommendation. The framework allows recommender systems to achieve\npersonalized fairness for users while also covering non-personalized\nsituations. Experiments on two real-world datasets with shallow and deep\nrecommendation algorithms show that our method can generate fairer\nrecommendations for users with a desirable recommendation performance.",

          "description": "Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a fundamental building block in\ninformation retrieval with graph-based indices being the current\nstate-of-the-art and widely used in the industry. Recent advances in\ngraph-based indices have made it possible to index and search billion-point\ndatasets with high recall and millisecond-level latency on a single commodity\nmachine with an SSD.\n\nHowever, existing graph algorithms for ANNS support only static indices that\ncannot reflect real-time changes to the corpus required by many key real-world\nscenarios (e.g. index of sentences in documents, email, or a news index). To\novercome this drawback, the current industry practice for manifesting updates\ninto such indices is to periodically re-build these indices, which can be\nprohibitively expensive.\n\nIn this paper, we present the first graph-based ANNS index that reflects\ncorpus updates into the index in real-time without compromising on search\nperformance. Using update rules for this index, we design FreshDiskANN, a\nsystem that can index over a billion points on a workstation with an SSD and\nlimited memory, and support thousands of concurrent real-time inserts, deletes\nand searches per second each, while retaining $>95\\%$ 5-recall@5. This\nrepresents a 5-10x reduction in the cost of maintaining freshness in indices\nwhen compared to existing methods.",

          "description": "An emerging recipe for achieving state-of-the-art effectiveness in neural\ndocument re-ranking involves utilizing large pre-trained language models -\ne.g., BERT - to evaluate all individual passages in the document and then\naggregating the outputs by pooling or additional Transformer layers. A major\ndrawback of this approach is high query latency due to the cost of evaluating\nevery passage in the document with BERT. To make matters worse, this high\ninference cost and latency varies based on the length of the document, with\nlonger documents requiring more time and computation. To address this\nchallenge, we adopt an intra-document cascading strategy, which prunes passages\nof a candidate document using a less expensive model, called ESM, before\nrunning a scoring model that is more expensive and effective, called ETM. We\nfound it best to train ESM (short for Efficient Student Model) via knowledge\ndistillation from the ETM (short for Effective Teacher Model) e.g., BERT. This\npruning allows us to only run the ETM model on a smaller set of passages whose\nsize does not vary by document length. Our experiments on the MS MARCO and TREC\nDeep Learning Track benchmarks suggest that the proposed Intra-Document\nCascaded Ranking Model (IDCM) leads to over 400% lower query latency by\nproviding essentially the same effectiveness as the state-of-the-art BERT-based\ndocument ranking models.",

          "description": "Learning from implicit feedback is one of the most common cases in the\napplication of recommender systems. Generally speaking, interacted examples are\nconsidered as positive while negative examples are sampled from uninteracted\nones. However, noisy examples are prevalent in real-world implicit feedback. A\nnoisy positive example could be interacted but it actually leads to negative\nuser preference. A noisy negative example which is uninteracted because of\nunawareness of the user could also denote potential positive user preference.\nConventional training methods overlook these noisy examples, leading to\nsub-optimal recommendation. In this work, we propose probabilistic and\nvariational recommendation denoising for implicit feedback. Through an\nempirical study, we find that different models make relatively similar\npredictions on clean examples which denote the real user preference, while the\npredictions on noisy examples vary much more across different models. Motivated\nby this observation, we propose denoising with probabilistic inference (DPI)\nwhich aims to minimize the KL-divergence between the real user preference\ndistributions parameterized by two recommendation models while maximize the\nlikelihood of data observation. We then show that DPI recovers the evidence\nlower bound of an variational auto-encoder when the real user preference is\nconsidered as the latent variables. This leads to our second learning framework\ndenoising with variational autoencoder (DVAE). We employ the proposed DPI and\nDVAE on four state-of-the-art recommendation models and conduct experiments on\nthree datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that DPI and DVAE\nsignificantly improve recommendation performance compared with normal training\nand other denoising methods. Codes will be open-sourced.",

          "description": "Lattices have been conceived as a powerful tool for data hiding. While\nconventional studies and applications focus on achieving the optimal robustness\nversus distortion tradeoff, in some applications such as data hiding in\nmedical/physiological signals, the primary concern is to achieve a minimum\namount of distortion to the cover signal. In this paper, we revisit the\ncelebrated quantization index modulation (QIM) scheme and propose a\nminimum-distortion version of it, referred to as MD-QIM. The crux of MD-QIM is\nto move the data point to only the boundary of the Voronoi region of the\nlattice point indexed by a message, which suffices for subsequent correct\ndecoding. At any fixed code rate, the scheme achieves the minimum amount of\ndistortion by sacrificing the robustness to the additive white Gaussian noise\n(AWGN) attacks. Simulation results confirm that our scheme significantly\noutperforms QIM in terms of mean square error (MSE), peak signal to noise ratio\n(PSNR) and percentage residual difference (PRD).",

          "description": "The ubiquity of mobile phones makes mobile GUI understanding an important\ntask. Most previous works in this domain require human-created metadata of\nscreens (e.g. View Hierarchy) during inference, which unfortunately is often\nnot available or reliable enough for GUI understanding. Inspired by the\nimpressive success of Transformers in NLP tasks, targeting for purely\nvision-based GUI understanding, we extend the concepts of Words/Sentence to\nPixel-Words/Screen-Sentence, and propose a mobile GUI understanding\narchitecture: Pixel-Words to Screen-Sentence (PW2SS). In analogy to the\nindividual Words, we define the Pixel-Words as atomic visual components (text\nand graphic components), which are visually consistent and semantically clear\nacross screenshots of a large variety of design styles. The Pixel-Words\nextracted from a screenshot are aggregated into Screen-Sentence with a Screen\nTransformer proposed to model their relations. Since the Pixel-Words are\ndefined as atomic visual components, the ambiguity between their visual\nappearance and semantics is dramatically reduced. We are able to make use of\nmetadata available in training data to auto-generate high-quality annotations\nfor Pixel-Words. A dataset, RICO-PW, of screenshots with Pixel-Words\nannotations is built based on the public RICO dataset, which will be released\nto help to address the lack of high-quality training data in this area. We\ntrain a detector to extract Pixel-Words from screenshots on this dataset and\nachieve metadata-free GUI understanding during inference. We conduct\nexperiments and show that Pixel-Words can be well extracted on RICO-PW and well\ngeneralized to a new dataset, P2S-UI, collected by ourselves. The effectiveness\nof PW2SS is further verified in the GUI understanding tasks including relation\nprediction, clickability prediction, screen retrieval, and app type\nclassification.",

          "description": "Transformer networks are effective at modeling long-range contextual\ninformation and have recently demonstrated exemplary performance in the natural\nlanguage processing domain. Conventionally, the temporal action proposal\ngeneration (TAPG) task is divided into two main sub-tasks: boundary prediction\nand proposal confidence prediction, which rely on the frame-level dependencies\nand proposal-level relationships separately. To capture the dependencies at\ndifferent levels of granularity, this paper intuitively presents a unified\ntemporal action proposal generation framework with original Transformers,\ncalled TAPG Transformer, which consists of a Boundary Transformer and a\nProposal Transformer. Specifically, the Boundary Transformer captures long-term\ntemporal dependencies to predict precise boundary information and the Proposal\nTransformer learns the rich inter-proposal relationships for reliable\nconfidence evaluation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two popular\nbenchmarks: ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS14, and the results demonstrate that TAPG\nTransformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Equipped with the existing\naction classifier, our method achieves remarkable performance on the temporal\naction localization task. Codes and models will be available.",

          "description": "Food retrieval is an important task to perform analysis of food-related\ninformation, where we are interested in retrieving relevant information about\nthe queried food item such as ingredients, cooking instructions, etc. In this\npaper, we investigate cross-modal retrieval between food images and cooking\nrecipes. The goal is to learn an embedding of images and recipes in a common\nfeature space, such that the corresponding image-recipe embeddings lie close to\none another. Two major challenges in addressing this problem are 1) large\nintra-variance and small inter-variance across cross-modal food data; and 2)\ndifficulties in obtaining discriminative recipe representations. To address\nthese two problems, we propose Semantic-Consistent and Attention-based Networks\n(SCAN), which regularize the embeddings of the two modalities through aligning\noutput semantic probabilities. Besides, we exploit a self-attention mechanism\nto improve the embedding of recipes. We evaluate the performance of the\nproposed method on the large-scale Recipe1M dataset, and show that we can\noutperform several state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval strategies for food\nimages and cooking recipes by a significant margin.",

          "description": "Long-range and short-range temporal modeling are two complementary and\ncrucial aspects of video recognition. Most of the state-of-the-arts focus on\nshort-range spatio-temporal modeling and then average multiple snippet-level\npredictions to yield the final video-level prediction. Thus, their video-level\nprediction does not consider spatio-temporal features of how video evolves\nalong the temporal dimension. In this paper, we introduce a novel Dynamic\nSegment Aggregation (DSA) module to capture relationship among snippets. To be\nmore specific, we attempt to generate a dynamic kernel for a convolutional\noperation to aggregate long-range temporal information among adjacent snippets\nadaptively. The DSA module is an efficient plug-and-play module and can be\ncombined with the off-the-shelf clip-based models (i.e., TSM, I3D) to perform\npowerful long-range modeling with minimal overhead. The final video\narchitecture, coined as DSANet. We conduct extensive experiments on several\nvideo recognition benchmarks (i.e., Mini-Kinetics-200, Kinetics-400,\nSomething-Something V1 and ActivityNet) to show its superiority. Our proposed\nDSA module is shown to benefit various video recognition models significantly.\nFor example, equipped with DSA modules, the top-1 accuracy of I3D ResNet-50 is\nimproved from 74.9% to 78.2% on Kinetics-400.

          "description": "360{\\deg} videos a.k.a. spherical videos are getting popular among users\nnevertheless, omnidirectional view of these videos demands high bandwidth and\nprocessing power at the end devices. Recently proposed viewport aware streaming\nmechanisms can reduce the amount of data transmitted by streaming a limited\nportion of the frame covering the current user viewport (VP). However, they\nstill suffer from sending a high amount of redundant data, as the fixed tile\nmechanisms can not provide finer granularity to the user VP. Though making the\ntiles smaller can provide a finer granularity for user viewport, high encoding\noverhead incurred. To overcome this trade-off, in this paper, we present a\ncomputational geometric approach based adaptive tiling mechanism named VAD360,\nwhich takes visual attention information on the 360{\\deg} video frame as the\ninput and provide a suitable non-overlapping variable size tile cover on the\nframe. Experimental results shows that VAD360 can save up to 31.1% of pixel\nredundancy before compression and 35.4% of bandwidth saving compared to\nrecently proposed fixed tile configurations, providing tile schemes within\n0.98($\\pm$0.11)s time frame.",

          "description": "With the explosive growth of video data, video summarization, which attempts\nto seek the minimum subset of frames while still conveying the main story, has\nbecome one of the hottest topics. Nowadays, substantial achievements have been\nmade by supervised learning techniques, especially after the emergence of deep\nlearning. However, it is extremely expensive and difficult to collect human\nannotation for large-scale video datasets. To address this problem, we propose\na convolutional attentive adversarial network (CAAN), whose key idea is to\nbuild a deep summarizer in an unsupervised way. Upon the generative adversarial\nnetwork, our overall framework consists of a generator and a discriminator. The\nformer predicts importance scores for all frames of a video while the latter\ntries to distinguish the score-weighted frame features from original frame\nfeatures. Specifically, the generator employs a fully convolutional sequence\nnetwork to extract global representation of a video, and an attention-based\nnetwork to output normalized importance scores. To learn the parameters, our\nobjective function is composed of three loss functions, which can guide the\nframe-level importance score prediction collaboratively. To validate this\nproposed method, we have conducted extensive experiments on two public\nbenchmarks SumMe and TVSum. The results show the superiority of our proposed\nmethod against other state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches. Our method even\noutperforms some published supervised approaches.",

Despite the growing popularity of VR gaming, user studies\ninto how it might affect the player experience (PX) during the gameplay are\nscarce. Accordingly, the current study investigated the effects of VR gaming\nand game genre on PX. We compared PX metrics for two game genres, strategy\n(more interactive) and racing (less interactive), across two gaming platforms,\nVR and traditional desktop gaming. Participants were randomly assigned to one\nof the gaming platforms, played both a strategy and racing game on their\ncorresponding platform, and provided PX ratings. Results revealed that,\nregardless of the game genre, participants in the VR gaming condition\nexperienced a greater level of sense of presence than did those in the desktop\ngaming condition. That said, results showed that the two gaming platforms did\nnot significantly differ from one another in PX ratings. As for the effect of\ngame genre, participants provided greater PX ratings for the strategy game than\nfor the racing game, regardless of whether the game was played on a VR headset\nor desktop computer. Collectively, these results indicate that although VR\ngaming affords a greater sense of presence in the game environment, this\nincrease in presence does not seem to translate into a more satisfactory PX\nwhen playing either a strategy or racing game.",

Robustness and imperceptibility are two\nchallenging features of watermarking methods that the trade-off between them\nshould be satisfied.

In this work, we propose multimodal\nknowledge expansion (MKE), a knowledge distillation-based framework to\neffectively utilize multimodal data without requiring labels.

However, in many image and video processing applications, the ability\nto resize by a fractional factor would be advantageous. One example is\nconversion between resolutions standardized for video compression, such as from\n1080p to 720p. To solve this problem, we propose an alternative building block,\nformulated as a conventional convolutional layer followed by a differentiable\nresizer. More concretely, the convolutional layer preserves the resolution of\nthe input, while the resizing operation is fully handled by the resizer. In\nthis way, any CNN architecture can be adapted for non-integer resizing. As an\napplication, we replace the resizing convolutional layer of a modern deep\ndownsampling model by the proposed building block, and apply it to an adaptive\nbitrate video streaming scenario. Our experimental results show that an\nimprovement in coding efficiency over the conventional Lanczos algorithm is\nattained, in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and VMAF on test videos.",

          "description": "The content based image retrieval aims to find the similar images from a\nlarge scale dataset against a query image. Generally, the similarity between\nthe representative features of the query image and dataset images is used to\nrank the images for retrieval. In early days, various hand designed feature\ndescriptors have been investigated based on the visual cues such as color,\ntexture, shape, etc. that represent the images. However, the deep learning has\nemerged as a dominating alternative of hand-designed feature engineering from a\ndecade. It learns the features automatically from the data. This paper presents\na comprehensive survey of deep learning based developments in the past decade\nfor content based image retrieval. The categorization of existing\nstate-of-the-art methods from different perspectives is also performed for\ngreater understanding of the progress. The taxonomy used in this survey covers\ndifferent supervision, different networks, different descriptor type and\ndifferent retrieval type.

Increasing\ncases of online antisemitism have become one of the major concerns because of\nits socio-political consequences. Unlike other major forms of online abuse like\nracism, sexism, etc., online antisemitism has not been studied much from a\nmachine learning perspective. To the best of our knowledge, we present the\nfirst work in the direction of automated multimodal detection of online\nantisemitism. The task poses multiple challenges that include extracting\nsignals across multiple modalities, contextual references, and handling\nmultiple aspects of antisemitism. Unfortunately, there does not exist any\npublicly available benchmark corpus for this critical task. Hence, we collect\nand label two datasets with 3,102 and 3,509 social media posts from Twitter and\nGab respectively. Further, we present a multimodal deep learning system that\ndetects the presence of antisemitic content and its specific antisemitism\ncategory using text and images from posts.

          "description": "A common strategy for improving model robustness is through data\naugmentations. Data augmentations encourage models to learn desired\ninvariances, such as invariance to horizontal flipping or small changes in\ncolor. Recent work has shown that arbitrary style transfer can be used as a\nform of data augmentation to encourage invariance to textures by creating\npainting-like images from photographs. However, a stylized photograph is not\nquite the same as an artist-created painting. Artists depict perceptually\nmeaningful cues in paintings so that humans can recognize salient components in\nscenes, an emphasis which is not enforced in style transfer. Therefore, we\nstudy how style transfer and paintings differ in their impact on model\nrobustness. First, we investigate the role of paintings as style images for\nstylization-based data augmentation. We find that style transfer functions well\neven without paintings as style images. Second, we show that learning from\npaintings as a form of perceptual data augmentation can improve model\nrobustness. Finally, we investigate the invariances learned from stylization\nand from paintings, and show that models learn different invariances from these\ndiffering forms of data. Our results provide insights into how stylization\nimproves model robustness, and provide evidence that artist-created paintings\ncan be a valuable source of data for model robustness.",

          "description": "Deep learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples that\nare elaborately designed for malicious purposes and are imperceptible to the\nhuman perceptual system. Autoencoder, when trained solely over benign examples,\nhas been widely used for (self-supervised) adversarial detection based on the\nassumption that adversarial examples yield larger reconstruction error.\nHowever, because lacking adversarial examples in its training and the too\nstrong generalization ability of autoencoder, this assumption does not always\nhold true in practice. To alleviate this problem, we explore to detect\nadversarial examples by disentangled representations of images under the\nautoencoder structure. By disentangling input images as class features and\nsemantic features, we train an autoencoder, assisted by a discriminator\nnetwork, over both correctly paired class/semantic features and incorrectly\npaired class/semantic features to reconstruct benign and counterexamples. This\nmimics the behavior of adversarial examples and can reduce the unnecessary\ngeneralization ability of autoencoder. Compared with the state-of-the-art\nself-supervised detection methods, our method exhibits better performance in\nvarious measurements (i.e., AUC, FPR, TPR) over different datasets (MNIST,\nFashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10), different adversarial attack methods (FGSM, BIM,\nPGD, DeepFool, and CW) and different victim models (8-layer CNN and 16-layer\nVGG). We compare our method with the state-of-the-art self-supervised detection\nmethods under different adversarial attacks and different victim models (30\nattack settings), and it exhibits better performance in various measurements\n(AUC, FPR, TPR) for most attacks settings. Ideally, AUC is $1$ and our method\nachieves $0.99+$ on CIFAR-10 for all attacks. Notably, different from other\nAutoencoder-based detectors, our method can provide resistance to the adaptive\nadversary.",

          "description": "This paper proposes a novel method of learning by predicting view assignments\nwith support samples (PAWS). The method trains a model to minimize a\nconsistency loss, which ensures that different views of the same unlabeled\ninstance are assigned similar pseudo-labels. The pseudo-labels are generated\nnon-parametrically, by comparing the representations of the image views to\nthose of a set of randomly sampled labeled images. The distance between the\nview representations and labeled representations is used to provide a weighting\nover class labels, which we interpret as a soft pseudo-label. By\nnon-parametrically incorporating labeled samples in this way, PAWS extends the\ndistance-metric loss used in self-supervised methods such as BYOL and SwAV to\nthe semi-supervised setting. Despite the simplicity of the approach, PAWS\noutperforms other semi-supervised methods across architectures, setting a new\nstate-of-the-art for a ResNet-50 on ImageNet trained with either 10% or 1% of\nthe labels, reaching 75.5% and 66.5% top-1 respectively.

          "description": "Learning depth from spherical panoramas is becoming a popular research topic\nbecause a panorama has a full field-of-view of the environment and provides a\nrelatively complete description of a scene. However, applying well-studied CNNs\nfor perspective images to the standard representation of spherical panoramas,\ni.e., the equirectangular projection, is suboptimal, as it becomes distorted\ntowards the poles. Another representation is the cubemap projection, which is\ndistortion-free but discontinued on edges and limited in the field-of-view.\nThis paper introduces a new framework to fuse features from the two\nprojections, unidirectionally feeding the cubemap features to the\nequirectangular features only at the decoding stage. Unlike the recent\nbidirectional fusion approach operating at both the encoding and decoding\nstages, our fusion scheme is much more efficient. Besides, we also designed a\nmore effective fusion module for our fusion scheme. Experiments verify the\neffectiveness of our proposed fusion strategy and module, and our model\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on four popular datasets.

          "description": "A growing branch of computer vision is object detection. Object detection is\nused in many applications such as industrial process, medical imaging analysis,\nand autonomous vehicles. The ability to detect objects in videos is crucial.\nObject detection systems are trained on large image datasets. For applications\nsuch as autonomous vehicles, it is crucial that the object detection system can\nidentify objects through multiple frames in video. There are many problems with\napplying these systems to video. Shadows or changes in brightness that can\ncause the system to incorrectly identify objects frame to frame and cause an\nunintended system response. There are many neural networks that have been used\nfor object detection and if there was a way of connecting objects between\nframes then these problems could be eliminated. For these neural networks to\nget better at identifying objects in video, they need to be re-trained. A\ndataset must be created with images that represent consecutive video frames and\nhave matching ground-truth layers. A method is proposed that can generate these\ndatasets. The ground-truth layer contains only moving objects. To generate this\nlayer, FlowNet2-Pytorch was used to create the flow mask using the novel\nMagnitude Method. As well, a segmentation mask will be generated using networks\nsuch as Mask R-CNN or Refinenet. These segmentation masks will contain all\nobjects detected in a frame. By comparing this segmentation mask to the flow\nmask ground-truth layer, a loss function is generated. This loss function can\nbe used to train a neural network to be better at making consistent predictions\non video. The system was tested on multiple video samples and a loss was\ngenerated for each frame, proving the Magnitude Method's ability to be used to\ntrain object detection neural networks in future work.",

          "description": "Video anomaly detection is commonly used in many applications such as\nsecurity surveillance and is very challenging.A majority of recent video\nanomaly detection approaches utilize deep reconstruction models, but their\nperformance is often suboptimal because of insufficient reconstruction error\ndifferences between normal and abnormal video frames in practice. Meanwhile,\nframe prediction-based anomaly detection methods have shown promising\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a novel and robust unsupervised video\nanomaly detection method by frame prediction with proper design which is more\nin line with the characteristics of surveillance videos. The proposed method is\nequipped with a multi-path ConvGRU-based frame prediction network that can\nbetter handle semantically informative objects and areas of different scales\nand capture spatial-temporal dependencies in normal videos. A noise tolerance\nloss is introduced during training to mitigate the interference caused by\nbackground noise. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the CUHK Avenue,\nShanghaiTech Campus, and UCSD Pedestrian datasets, and the results show that\nour proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.\nRemarkably, our proposed method obtains the frame-level AUROC score of 88.3% on\nthe CUHK Avenue dataset.",

          "description": "Leading methods in the domain of action recognition try to distill\ninformation from both the spatial and temporal dimensions of an input video.\nMethods that reach State of the Art (SotA) accuracy, usually make use of 3D\nconvolution layers as a way to abstract the temporal information from video\nframes. The use of such convolutions requires sampling short clips from the\ninput video, where each clip is a collection of closely sampled frames. Since\neach short clip covers a small fraction of an input video, multiple clips are\nsampled at inference in order to cover the whole temporal length of the video.\nThis leads to increased computational load and is impractical for real-world\napplications. We address the computational bottleneck by significantly reducing\nthe number of frames required for inference. Our approach relies on a temporal\ntransformer that applies global attention over video frames, and thus better\nexploits the salient information in each frame. Therefore our approach is very\ninput efficient, and can achieve SotA results (on Kinetics dataset) with a\nfraction of the data (frames per video), computation and latency. Specifically\non Kinetics-400, we reach $80.5$ top-1 accuracy with $\\times 30$ less frames\nper video, and $\\times 40$ faster inference than the current leading method.\nCode is available at: https://github.com/Alibaba-MIIL/STAM",

          "description": "Despite recent advances in vehicle safety technologies, road traffic\naccidents still pose a severe threat to human lives and have become a leading\ncause of premature deaths. In particular, crosswalks present a major threat to\npedestrians, but we lack dense behavioral data to investigate the risks they\nface. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive analytical model for pedestrian\npotential risk using video footage gathered by road security cameras deployed\nat such crossings. The proposed system automatically detects vehicles and\npedestrians, calculates trajectories by frames, and extracts behavioral\nfeatures affecting the likelihood of potentially dangerous scenes between these\nobjects. Finally, we design a data cube model by using the large amount of the\nextracted features accumulated in a data warehouse to perform multidimensional\nanalysis for potential risk scenes with levels of abstraction, but this is\nbeyond the scope of this paper, and will be detailed in a future study. In our\nexperiment, we focused on extracting the various behavioral features from\nmultiple crosswalks, and visualizing and interpreting their behaviors and\nrelationships among them by camera location to show how they may or may not\ncontribute to potential risk. We validated feasibility and applicability by\napplying it in multiple crosswalks in Osan city, Korea.",

          "description": "Most consumer-grade digital cameras can only capture a limited range of\nluminance in real-world scenes due to sensor constraints. Besides, noise and\nquantization errors are often introduced in the imaging process. In order to\nobtain high dynamic range (HDR) images with excellent visual quality, the most\ncommon solution is to combine multiple images with different exposures.\nHowever, it is not always feasible to obtain multiple images of the same scene\nand most HDR reconstruction methods ignore the noise and quantization loss. In\nthis work, we propose a novel learning-based approach using a spatially dynamic\nencoder-decoder network, HDRUNet, to learn an end-to-end mapping for single\nimage HDR reconstruction with denoising and dequantization. The network\nconsists of a UNet-style base network to make full use of the hierarchical\nmulti-scale information, a condition network to perform pattern-specific\nmodulation and a weighting network for selectively retaining information.\nMoreover, we propose a Tanh_L1 loss function to balance the impact of\nover-exposed values and well-exposed values on the network learning. Our method\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance in quantitative comparisons and\nvisual quality.

In this paper, we study the problem of\nhow to map this intuitive human behavior to computer vision algorithms to\ndetect oncoming vehicles at night just from the light reflections they cause by\ntheir headlights. For that, we present an extensive open-source dataset\ncontaining 59746 annotated grayscale images out of 346 different scenes in a\nrural environment at night. In these images, all oncoming vehicles, their\ncorresponding light objects (e.g., headlamps), and their respective light\nreflections (e.g., light reflections on guardrails) are labeled. In this\ncontext, we discuss the characteristics of the dataset and the challenges in\nobjectively describing visual cues such as light reflections.

          "description": "In this paper, we argue that the unsatisfactory out-of-distribution (OOD)\ndetection performance of neural networks is mainly due to the SoftMax loss\nanisotropy and propensity to produce low entropy probability distributions in\ndisagreement with the principle of maximum entropy. Current out-of-distribution\n(OOD) detection approaches usually do not directly fix the SoftMax loss\ndrawbacks but rather build techniques to circumvent it. Unfortunately, those\nmethods usually produce undesired side effects (e.g., classification accuracy\ndrop, additional hyperparameters, slower inferences, and collecting extra\ndata). In the opposite direction, we propose replacing SoftMax loss with a\nnovel loss function that does not suffer from the mentioned weaknesses. The\nproposed IsoMax loss is isotropic (exclusively distance-based) and provides\nhigh entropy posterior probability distributions. Replacing the SoftMax loss by\nIsoMax loss requires no model or training changes. Additionally, the models\ntrained with IsoMax loss produce as fast and energy-efficient inferences as\nthose trained using SoftMax loss. Further, no classification accuracy drop is\nobserved. The proposed method does not rely on outlier/background data,\nhyperparameter tuning, temperature calibration, feature extraction, metric\nlearning, adversarial training, ensemble procedures, or generative models. Our\nexperiments showed that IsoMax loss works as a seamless SoftMax loss drop-in\nreplacement that significantly improves neural networks' OOD detection\nperformance. Therefore, it may be used as a baseline OOD detection approach to\nbe combined with current or future OOD detection techniques to achieve even\nhigher results.",

          "description": "Cardiac segmentation of atriums, ventricles, and myocardium in computed\ntomography (CT) images is an important first-line task for presymptomatic\ncardiovascular disease diagnosis. In several recent studies, deep learning\nmodels have shown significant breakthroughs in medical image segmentation\ntasks. Unlike other organs such as the lungs and liver, the cardiac organ\nconsists of multiple substructures, i.e., ventricles, atriums, aortas,\narteries, veins, and myocardium. These cardiac substructures are proximate to\neach other and have indiscernible boundaries (i.e., homogeneous intensity\nvalues), making it difficult for the segmentation network focus on the\nboundaries between the substructures. In this paper, to improve the\nsegmentation accuracy between proximate organs, we introduce a novel model to\nexploit shape and boundary-aware features. We primarily propose a shape-aware\nattention module, that exploits distance regression, which can guide the model\nto focus on the edges between substructures so that it can outperform the\nconventional contour-based attention method. In the experiments, we used the\nMulti-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation dataset that has 20 CT cardiac images\nfor training and validation, and 40 CT cardiac images for testing. The\nexperimental results show that the proposed network produces more accurate\nresults than state-of-the-art networks by improving the Dice similarity\ncoefficient score by 4.97%. Our proposed shape-aware contour attention\nmechanism demonstrates that distance transformation and boundary features\nimprove the actual attention map to strengthen the responses in the boundary\narea. Moreover, our proposed method significantly reduces the false-positive\nresponses of the final output, resulting in accurate segmentation.",

To this end, we propose\nto train an encoder-decoder network at image-level with small amounts of\nlabeled images, and more importantly, we learn latent representations directly\nat feature-level by imposing contrastive loss on unlabeled images. This method\nstrengthens intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, so as to get\na better pixel classifier. Moreover, we devise a student encoder for online\nlearning and an exponential moving average version of it, called teacher\nencoder, to improve the performance iteratively in a self-ensembling manner. To\nconstruct contrastive samples with unlabeled images, two sampling strategies\nthat exploit structure similarity across medical images and utilize\npseudo-labels for construction, termed region-aware and anatomical-aware\ncontrastive sampling, are investigated. We conduct extensive experiments on an\nMRI and a CT segmentation dataset and demonstrate that in a limited label\nsetting, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

          "description": "We present a novel approach for unsupervised activity segmentation, which\nuses video frame clustering as a pretext task and simultaneously performs\nrepresentation learning and online clustering. This is in contrast with prior\nworks where representation learning and online clustering are often performed\nsequentially. We leverage temporal information in videos by employing temporal\noptimal transport and temporal coherence loss. In particular, we incorporate a\ntemporal regularization term into the standard optimal transport module, which\npreserves the temporal order of the activity, yielding the temporal optimal\ntransport module for computing pseudo-label cluster assignments. Next, the\ntemporal coherence loss encourages neighboring video frames to be mapped to\nnearby points while distant video frames are mapped to farther away points in\nthe embedding space. The combination of these two components results in\neffective representations for unsupervised activity segmentation. Furthermore,\nprevious methods require storing learned features for the entire dataset before\nclustering them in an offline manner, whereas our approach processes one\nmini-batch at a time in an online manner. Extensive evaluations on three public\ndatasets, i.e. 50-Salads, YouTube Instructions, and Breakfast, and our dataset,\ni.e., Desktop Assembly, show that our approach performs on par or better than\nprevious methods for unsupervised activity segmentation, despite having\nsignificantly less memory constraints.",

          "description": "Existing vision-based action recognition is susceptible to occlusion and\nappearance variations, while wearable sensors can alleviate these challenges by\ncapturing human motion with one-dimensional time-series signal. For the same\naction, the knowledge learned from vision sensors and wearable sensors, may be\nrelated and complementary. However, there exists significantly large modality\ndifference between action data captured by wearable-sensor and vision-sensor in\ndata dimension, data distribution and inherent information content. In this\npaper, we propose a novel framework, named Semantics-aware Adaptive Knowledge\nDistillation Networks (SAKDN), to enhance action recognition in vision-sensor\nmodality (videos) by adaptively transferring and distilling the knowledge from\nmultiple wearable sensors. The SAKDN uses multiple wearable-sensors as teacher\nmodalities and uses RGB videos as student modality. To preserve local temporal\nrelationship and facilitate employing visual deep learning model, we transform\none-dimensional time-series signals of wearable sensors to two-dimensional\nimages by designing a gramian angular field based virtual image generation\nmodel. Then, we build a novel Similarity-Preserving Adaptive Multi-modal Fusion\nModule to adaptively fuse intermediate representation knowledge from different\nteacher networks. Finally, to fully exploit and transfer the knowledge of\nmultiple well-trained teacher networks to the student network, we propose a\nnovel Graph-guided Semantically Discriminative Mapping loss, which utilizes\ngraph-guided ablation analysis to produce a good visual explanation\nhighlighting the important regions across modalities and concurrently\npreserving the interrelations of original data. Experimental results on\nBerkeley-MHAD, UTD-MHAD and MMAct datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our proposed SAKDN.",

          "description": "In recent years, significant progress has been made in the research of facial\nlandmark detection. However, few prior works have thoroughly discussed about\nmodels for practical applications. Instead, they often focus on improving a\ncouple of issues at a time while ignoring the others. To bridge this gap, we\naim to explore a practical model that is accurate, robust, efficient,\ngeneralizable, and end-to-end trainable at the same time. To this end, we first\npropose a baseline model equipped with one transformer decoder as detection\nhead. In order to achieve a better accuracy, we further propose two lightweight\nmodules, namely dynamic query initialization (DQInit) and query-aware memory\n(QAMem). Specifically, DQInit dynamically initializes the queries of decoder\nfrom the inputs, enabling the model to achieve as good accuracy as the ones\nwith multiple decoder layers. QAMem is designed to enhance the discriminative\nability of queries on low-resolution feature maps by assigning separate memory\nvalues to each query rather than a shared one. With the help of QAMem, our\nmodel removes the dependence on high-resolution feature maps and is still able\nto obtain superior accuracy. Extensive experiments and analysis on three\npopular benchmarks show the effectiveness and practical advantages of the\nproposed model. Notably, our model achieves new state of the art on WFLW as\nwell as competitive results on 300W and COFW, while still running at 50+ FPS.",

          "description": "In this work, we aim to address the 3D scene stylization problem - generating\nstylized images of the scene at arbitrary novel view angles. A straightforward\nsolution is to combine existing novel view synthesis and image/video style\ntransfer approaches, which often leads to blurry results or inconsistent\nappearance. Inspired by the high quality results of the neural radiance fields\n(NeRF) method, we propose a joint framework to directly render novel views with\nthe desired style. Our framework consists of two components: an implicit\nrepresentation of the 3D scene with the neural radiance field model, and a\nhypernetwork to transfer the style information into the scene representation.\nIn particular, our implicit representation model disentangles the scene into\nthe geometry and appearance branches, and the hypernetwork learns to predict\nthe parameters of the appearance branch from the reference style image. To\nalleviate the training difficulties and memory burden, we propose a two-stage\ntraining procedure and a patch sub-sampling approach to optimize the style and\ncontent losses with the neural radiance field model. After optimization, our\nmodel is able to render consistent novel views at arbitrary view angles with\narbitrary style.

Unlike convolutions which\nare inherently parallel, the de-facto standard for NMS, namely GreedyNMS,\ncannot be easily parallelized and thus could be the performance bottleneck in\nconvolutional object detection pipelines. MaxpoolNMS is introduced as a\nparallelizable alternative to GreedyNMS, which in turn enables faster speed\nthan GreedyNMS at comparable accuracy. However, MaxpoolNMS is only capable of\nreplacing the GreedyNMS at the first stage of two-stage detectors like\nFaster-RCNN. There is a significant drop in accuracy when applying MaxpoolNMS\nat the final detection stage, due to the fact that MaxpoolNMS fails to\napproximate GreedyNMS precisely in terms of bounding box selection. In this\npaper, we propose a general, parallelizable and configurable approach\nPSRR-MaxpoolNMS, to completely replace GreedyNMS at all stages in all\ndetectors. By introducing a simple Relationship Recovery module and a Pyramid\nShifted MaxpoolNMS module, our PSRR-MaxpoolNMS is able to approximate GreedyNMS\nmore precisely than MaxpoolNMS.

Our method can match equirectangular images to the 3D range\nprojections by extracting cross-domain symmetric place descriptors. Our key\ninsight is to retain condition-invariant 3D geometry features from limited data\nsamples while eliminating the condition-related features by a designed\nGenerative Adversarial Network.

Intuitively, learning spatial\ncontextual information first will benefit temporal modeling. In this paper, we\npropose a separable self-attention (SSA) module, which models spatial and\ntemporal correlations sequentially, so that spatial contexts can be efficiently\nused in temporal modeling.

This problem\nhas been recently explored for visual SLAM, but to the best of our knowledge no\nwork has been attempted to address DST for LiDAR scans. The problem is of\ncritical importance due to wide-spread adoption of LiDAR in Autonomous\nVehicles. We show that state-of the art methods developed for the visual domain\nwhen adapted for LiDAR scans perform poorly.\n\nWe develop DSLR, a deep generative model which learns a mapping between\ndynamic scan to its static counterpart through an adversarially trained\nautoencoder. Our model yields the first solution for DST on LiDAR that\ngenerates static scans without using explicit segmentation labels. DSLR cannot\nalways be applied to real world data due to lack of paired dynamic-static\nscans. Using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, we propose DSLR-UDA for transfer\nto real world data and experimentally show that this performs well in real\nworld settings. Additionally, if segmentation information is available, we\nextend DSLR to DSLR-Seg to further improve the reconstruction quality.\n\nDSLR gives the state of the art performance on simulated and real-world\ndatasets and also shows at least 4x improvement.

Instead of naively pipelining these techniques, our Joint-DetNAS\noptimizes them jointly. The algorithm consists of two core processes: student\nmorphism optimizes the student's architecture and removes the redundant\nparameters, while dynamic distillation aims to find the optimal matching\nteacher. For student morphism, weight inheritance strategy is adopted, allowing\nthe student to flexibly update its architecture while fully utilize the\npredecessor's weights, which considerably accelerates the search; To facilitate\ndynamic distillation, an elastic teacher pool is trained via integrated\nprogressive shrinking strategy, from which teacher detectors can be sampled\nwithout additional cost in subsequent searches. Given a base detector as the\ninput, our algorithm directly outputs the derived student detector with high\nperformance without additional training. Experiments demonstrate that our\nJoint-DetNAS outperforms the naive pipelining approach by a great margin. Given\na classic R101-FPN as the base detector, Joint-DetNAS is able to boost its mAP\nfrom 41.4 to 43.9 on MS COCO and reduce the latency by 47%, which is on par\nwith the SOTA EfficientDet while requiring less search cost.

          "description": "Recent advances in unsupervised domain adaptation have seen considerable\nprogress in semantic segmentation. Existing methods either align different\ndomains with adversarial training or involve the self-learning that utilizes\npseudo labels to conduct supervised training. The former always suffers from\nthe unstable training caused by adversarial training and only focuses on the\ninter-domain gap that ignores intra-domain knowledge. The latter tends to put\noverconfident label prediction on wrong categories, which propagates errors to\nmore samples. To solve these problems, we propose a two-stage adaptive semantic\nsegmentation method based on the local Lipschitz constraint that satisfies both\ndomain alignment and domain-specific exploration under a unified principle. In\nthe first stage, we propose the local Lipschitzness regularization as the\nobjective function to align different domains by exploiting intra-domain\nknowledge, which explores a promising direction for non-adversarial adaptive\nsemantic segmentation. In the second stage, we use the local Lipschitzness\nregularization to estimate the probability of satisfying Lipschitzness for each\npixel, and then dynamically sets the threshold of pseudo labels to conduct\nself-learning. Such dynamical self-learning effectively avoids the error\npropagation caused by noisy labels. Optimization in both stages is based on the\nsame principle, i.e., the local Lipschitz constraint, so that the knowledge\nlearned in the first stage can be maintained in the second stage. Further, due\nto the model-agnostic property, our method can easily adapt to any CNN-based\nsemantic segmentation networks.

          "description": "Electric Vehicles are increasingly common, with inductive chargepads being\nconsidered a convenient and efficient means of charging electric vehicles.\nHowever, drivers are typically poor at aligning the vehicle to the necessary\naccuracy for efficient inductive charging, making the automated alignment of\nthe two charging plates desirable. In parallel to the electrification of the\nvehicular fleet, automated parking systems that make use of surround-view\ncamera systems are becoming increasingly popular. In this work, we propose a\nsystem based on the surround-view camera architecture to detect, localize and\nautomatically align the vehicle with the inductive chargepad. The visual design\nof the chargepads is not standardized and not necessarily known beforehand.\nTherefore a system that relies on offline training will fail in some\nsituations. Thus we propose an online learning method that leverages the\ndriver's actions when manually aligning the vehicle with the chargepad and\ncombine it with weak supervision from semantic segmentation and depth to learn\na classifier to auto-annotate the chargepad in the video for further training.\nIn this way, when faced with a previously unseen chargepad, the driver needs\nonly manually align the vehicle a single time. As the chargepad is flat on the\nground, it is not easy to detect it from a distance. Thus, we propose using a\nVisual SLAM pipeline to learn landmarks relative to the chargepad to enable\nalignment from a greater range. We demonstrate the working system on an\nautomated vehicle as illustrated in the video https://youtu.be/_cLCmkW4UYo.

          "description": "Detection and classification of objects in overhead images are two important\nand challenging problems in computer vision. Among various research areas in\nthis domain, the task of fine-grained classification of objects in overhead\nimages has become ubiquitous in diverse real-world applications, due to recent\nadvances in high-resolution satellite and airborne imaging systems. The small\ninter-class variations and the large intra class variations caused by the fine\ngrained nature make it a challenging task, especially in low-resource cases. In\nthis paper, we introduce COFGA a new open dataset for the advancement of\nfine-grained classification research. The 2,104 images in the dataset are\ncollected from an airborne imaging system at 5 15 cm ground sampling distance,\nproviding higher spatial resolution than most public overhead imagery datasets.\nThe 14,256 annotated objects in the dataset were classified into 2 classes, 15\nsubclasses, 14 unique features, and 8 perceived colors a total of 37 distinct\nlabels making it suitable to the task of fine-grained classification more than\nany other publicly available overhead imagery dataset. We compare COFGA to\nother overhead imagery datasets and then describe some distinguished fine-grain\nclassification approaches that were explored during an open data-science\ncompetition we have conducted for this task.",

          "description": "Segmentation-based scene text detection methods have been widely adopted for\narbitrary-shaped text detection recently, since they make accurate pixel-level\npredictions on curved text instances and can facilitate real-time inference\nwithout time-consuming processing on anchors. However, current\nsegmentation-based models are unable to learn the shapes of curved texts and\noften require complex label assignments or repeated feature aggregations for\nmore accurate detection. In this paper, we propose RSCA: a Real-time\nSegmentation-based Context-Aware model for arbitrary-shaped scene text\ndetection, which sets a strong baseline for scene text detection with two\nsimple yet effective strategies: Local Context-Aware Upsampling and Dynamic\nText-Spine Labeling, which model local spatial transformation and simplify\nlabel assignments separately. Based on these strategies, RSCA achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both speed and accuracy, without complex label\nassignments or repeated feature aggregations. We conduct extensive experiments\non multiple benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of our method. RSCA-640\nreaches 83.9% F-measure at 48.3 FPS on CTW1500 dataset.",

          "description": "Data-free compression raises a new challenge because the original training\ndataset for a pre-trained model to be compressed is not available due to\nprivacy or transmission issues. Thus, a common approach is to compute a\nreconstructed training dataset before compression. The current reconstruction\nmethods compute the reconstructed training dataset with a generator by\nexploiting information from the pre-trained model. However, current\nreconstruction methods focus on extracting more information from the\npre-trained model but do not leverage network engineering. This work is the\nfirst to consider network engineering as an approach to design the\nreconstruction method. Specifically, we propose the AutoReCon method, which is\na neural architecture search-based reconstruction method. In the proposed\nAutoReCon method, the generator architecture is designed automatically given\nthe pre-trained model for reconstruction. Experimental results show that using\ngenerators discovered by the AutoRecon method always improve the performance of\ndata-free compression.",

          "description": "In this paper, we propose a new deep image compression framework called\nComplexity and Bitrate Adaptive Network (CBANet), which aims to learn one\nsingle network to support variable bitrate coding under different computational\ncomplexity constraints. In contrast to the existing state-of-the-art learning\nbased image compression frameworks that only consider the rate-distortion\ntrade-off without introducing any constraint related to the computational\ncomplexity, our CBANet considers the trade-off between the rate and distortion\nunder dynamic computational complexity constraints. Specifically, to decode the\nimages with one single decoder under various computational complexity\nconstraints, we propose a new multi-branch complexity adaptive module, in which\neach branch only takes a small portion of the computational budget of the\ndecoder. The reconstructed images with different visual qualities can be\nreadily generated by using different numbers of branches. Furthermore, to\nachieve variable bitrate decoding with one single decoder, we propose a bitrate\nadaptive module to project the representation from a base bitrate to the\nexpected representation at a target bitrate for transmission. Then it will\nproject the transmitted representation at the target bitrate back to that at\nthe base bitrate for the decoding process. The proposed bit adaptive module can\nsignificantly reduce the storage requirement for deployment platforms. As a\nresult, our CBANet enables one single codec to support multiple bitrate\ndecoding under various computational complexity constraints. Comprehensive\nexperiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nCBANet for deep image compression.",

          "description": "Pedestrian Detection is the most critical module of an Autonomous Driving\nsystem. Although a camera is commonly used for this purpose, its quality\ndegrades severely in low-light night time driving scenarios. On the other hand,\nthe quality of a thermal camera image remains unaffected in similar conditions.\nThis paper proposes an end-to-end multimodal fusion model for pedestrian\ndetection using RGB and thermal images. Its novel spatio-contextual deep\nnetwork architecture is capable of exploiting the multimodal input efficiently.\nIt consists of two distinct deformable ResNeXt-50 encoders for feature\nextraction from the two modalities. Fusion of these two encoded features takes\nplace inside a multimodal feature embedding module (MuFEm) consisting of\nseveral groups of a pair of Graph Attention Network and a feature fusion unit.\nThe output of the last feature fusion unit of MuFEm is subsequently passed to\ntwo CRFs for their spatial refinement. Further enhancement of the features is\nachieved by applying channel-wise attention and extraction of contextual\ninformation with the help of four RNNs traversing in four different directions.\nFinally, these feature maps are used by a single-stage decoder to generate the\nbounding box of each pedestrian and the score map. We have performed extensive\nexperiments of the proposed framework on three publicly available multimodal\npedestrian detection benchmark datasets, namely KAIST, CVC-14, and UTokyo. The\nresults on each of them improved the respective state-of-the-art performance.

          "description": "Unstructured neural network pruning algorithms have achieved impressive\ncompression rates. However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse\nmatrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional\nmemory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of\nunstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning\nsolutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient\nimplementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a\nflexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different\ngranularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining\nefficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for\nevery output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature\nmap). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP\nleverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,\nfacilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive\ncompression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning\nmodels trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.\nRelevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization\nof pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the\nnetwork, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic\nmetrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within\na layer.",

          "description": "In recent years, video data has dominated internet traffic and becomes one of\nthe major data formats. With the emerging 5G and internet of things (IoT)\ntechnologies, more and more videos are generated by edge devices, sent across\nnetworks, and consumed by machines. The volume of video consumed by machine is\nexceeding the volume of video consumed by humans. Machine vision tasks include\nobject detection, segmentation, tracking, and other machine-based applications,\nwhich are quite different from those for human consumption. On the other hand,\ndue to large volumes of video data, it is essential to compress video before\ntransmission. Thus, efficient video coding for machines (VCM) has become an\nimportant topic in academia and industry. In July 2019, the international\nstandardization organization, i.e., MPEG, created an Ad-Hoc group named VCM to\nstudy the requirements for potential standardization work. In this paper, we\nwill address the recent development activities in the MPEG VCM group.\nSpecifically, we will first provide an overview of the MPEG VCM group including\nuse cases, requirements, processing pipelines, plan for potential VCM\nstandards, followed by the evaluation framework including machine-vision tasks,\ndataset, evaluation metrics, and anchor generation. We then introduce\ntechnology solutions proposed so far and discuss the recent responses to the\nCall for Evidence issued by MPEG VCM group.",

          "description": "Inspired by the conclusion that humans choose the visual cortex regions\ncorresponding to the real size of an object to analyze its features when\nidentifying objects in the real world, this paper presents a framework,\nSizeNet, which is based on both the real sizes and features of objects to solve\nobject recognition problems. SizeNet was used for object recognition\nexperiments on the homemade Rsize dataset, and was compared with the\nstate-of-the-art methods AlexNet, VGG-16, Inception V3, Resnet-18, and\nDenseNet-121. The results showed that SizeNet provides much higher accuracy\nrates for object recognition than the other algorithms. SizeNet can solve the\ntwo problems of correctly recognizing objects with highly similar features but\nreal sizes that are obviously different from each other, and correctly\ndistinguishing a target object from interference objects whose real sizes are\nobviously different from the target object. This is because SizeNet recognizes\nobjects based not only on their features, but also on their real size. The real\nsize of an object can help exclude the interference object's categories whose\nreal size ranges do not match the real size of the object, which greatly\nreduces the object's categories' number in the label set used for the\ndownstream object recognition based on object features. SizeNet is of great\nsignificance for studying the interpretable computer vision. Our code and\ndataset will thus be made public.",

          "description": "The ability to accurately detect and localize objects is recognized as being\nthe most important for the perception of self-driving cars. From 2D to 3D\nobject detection, the most difficult is to determine the distance from the\nego-vehicle to objects. Expensive technology like LiDAR can provide a precise\nand accurate depth information, so most studies have tended to focus on this\nsensor showing a performance gap between LiDAR-based methods and camera-based\nmethods. Although many authors have investigated how to fuse LiDAR with RGB\ncameras, as far as we know there are no studies to fuse LiDAR and stereo in a\ndeep neural network for the 3D object detection task. This paper presents\nSLS-Fusion, a new approach to fuse data from 4-beam LiDAR and a stereo camera\nvia a neural network for depth estimation to achieve better dense depth maps\nand thereby improves 3D object detection performance. Since 4-beam LiDAR is\ncheaper than the well-known 64-beam LiDAR, this approach is also classified as\na low-cost sensors-based method. Through evaluation on the KITTI benchmark, it\nis shown that the proposed method significantly improves depth estimation\nperformance compared to a baseline method. Also, when applying it to 3D object\ndetection, a new state of the art on low-cost sensor based method is achieved.",

          "description": "Across a wide range of applications, from autonomous vehicles to medical\nimaging, multi-spectral images provide an opportunity to extract additional\ninformation not present in color images. One of the most important steps in\nmaking this information readily available is the accurate estimation of dense\ncorrespondences between different spectra.\n\nDue to the nature of cross-spectral images, most correspondence solving\ntechniques for the visual domain are simply not applicable. Furthermore, most\ncross-spectral techniques utilize spectra-specific characteristics to perform\nthe alignment. In this work, we aim to address the dense correspondence\nestimation problem in a way that generalizes to more than one spectrum. We do\nthis by introducing a novel cycle-consistency metric that allows us to\nself-supervise. This, combined with our spectra-agnostic loss functions, allows\nus to train the same network across multiple spectra.\n\nWe demonstrate our approach on the challenging task of dense RGB-FIR\ncorrespondence estimation. We also show the performance of our unmodified\nnetwork on the cases of RGB-NIR and RGB-RGB, where we achieve higher accuracy\nthan similar self-supervised approaches. Our work shows that cross-spectral\ncorrespondence estimation can be solved in a common framework that learns to\ngeneralize alignment across spectra.",

          "description": "In this paper, we quest the capability of transferring the quality of natural\nscene images to the images that are not acquired by optical cameras (e.g.,\nscreen content images, SCIs), rooted in the widely accepted view that the human\nvisual system has adapted and evolved through the perception of natural\nenvironment. Here, we develop the first unsupervised domain adaptation based no\nreference quality assessment method for SCIs, leveraging rich subjective\nratings of the natural images (NIs). In general, it is a non-trivial task to\ndirectly transfer the quality prediction model from NIs to a new type of\ncontent (i.e., SCIs) that holds dramatically different statistical\ncharacteristics. Inspired by the transferability of pair-wise relationship, the\nproposed quality measure operates based on the philosophy of improving the\ntransferability and discriminability simultaneously. In particular, we\nintroduce three types of losses which complementarily and explicitly regularize\nthe feature space of ranking in a progressive manner. Regarding feature\ndiscriminatory capability enhancement, we propose a center based loss to\nrectify the classifier and improve its prediction capability not only for\nsource domain (NI) but also the target domain (SCI). For feature discrepancy\nminimization, the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) is imposed on the extracted\nranking features of NIs and SCIs. Furthermore, to further enhance the feature\ndiversity, we introduce the correlation penalization between different feature\ndimensions, leading to the features with lower rank and higher diversity.\nExperiments show that our method can achieve higher performance on different\nsource-target settings based on a light-weight convolution neural network. The\nproposed method also sheds light on learning quality assessment measures for\nunseen application-specific content without the cumbersome and costing\nsubjective evaluations.",

          "description": "Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) requires precise time-of-flight measurements\nof the transmitted/received waveform to produce well-focused imagery. It is not\nuncommon for errors in these measurements to be present resulting in image\ndefocusing. To overcome this, an \\emph{autofocus} algorithm is employed as a\npost-processing step after image reconstruction to improve image focus. A\nparticular class of these algorithms can be framed as a sharpness/contrast\nmetric-based optimization. To improve convergence, a hand-crafted weighting\nfunction to remove \"bad\" areas of the image is sometimes applied to the\nimage-under-test before the optimization procedure. Additionally, dozens of\niterations are necessary for convergence which is a large compute burden for\nlow size, weight, and power (SWaP) systems. We propose a deep learning\ntechnique to overcome these limitations and implicitly learn the weighting\nfunction in a data-driven manner. Our proposed method, which we call Deep\nAutofocus, uses features from the single-look-complex (SLC) to estimate the\nphase correction which is applied in $k$-space. Furthermore, we train our\nalgorithm on batches of training imagery so that during deployment, only a\nsingle iteration of our method is sufficient to autofocus. We show results\ndemonstrating the robustness of our technique by comparing our results to four\ncommonly used image sharpness metrics. Our results demonstrate Deep Autofocus\ncan produce imagery perceptually better than common iterative techniques but at\na lower computational cost. We conclude that Deep Autofocus can provide a more\nfavorable cost-quality trade-off than alternatives with significant potential\nof future research.",

          "description": "Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for autonomous vehicles as it\ncan be used to segment objects in a class agnostic manner based on their motion\ncues. It enables the detection of unseen objects during training (e.g., moose\nor a construction truck) based on their motion and independent of their\nappearance. Although pixel-wise motion segmentation has been studied in\nautonomous driving literature, it has been rarely addressed at the instance\nlevel, which would help separate connected segments of moving objects leading\nto better trajectory planning. As the main issue is the lack of large public\ndatasets, we create a new InstanceMotSeg dataset comprising of 12.9K samples\nimproving upon our KITTIMoSeg dataset. In addition to providing instance level\nannotations, we have added 4 additional classes which is crucial for studying\nclass agnostic motion segmentation. We adapt YOLACT and implement a\nmotion-based class agnostic instance segmentation model which would act as a\nbaseline for the dataset. We also extend it to an efficient multi-task model\nwhich additionally provides semantic instance segmentation sharing the encoder.\nThe model then learns separate prototype coefficients within the class agnostic\nand semantic heads providing two independent paths of object detection for\nredundant safety. To obtain real-time performance, we study different efficient\nencoders and obtain 39 fps on a Titan Xp GPU using MobileNetV2 with an\nimprovement of 10% mAP relative to the baseline. Our model improves the\nprevious state of the art motion segmentation method by 3.3%. The dataset and\nqualitative results video are shared in our website at\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/instancemotseg/.",

          "description": "Camouflaged object detection (COD), which aims to identify the objects that\nconceal themselves into the surroundings, has recently drawn increasing\nresearch efforts in the field of computer vision. In practice, the success of\ndeep learning based COD is mainly determined by two key factors, including (i)\nA significantly large receptive field, which provides rich context information,\nand (ii) An effective fusion strategy, which aggregates the rich multi-level\nfeatures for accurate COD. Motivated by these observations, in this paper, we\npropose a novel deep learning based COD approach, which integrates the large\nreceptive field and effective feature fusion into a unified framework.\nSpecifically, we first extract multi-level features from a backbone network.\nThe resulting features are then fed to the proposed dual-branch mixture\nconvolution modules, each of which utilizes multiple asymmetric convolutional\nlayers and two dilated convolutional layers to extract rich context features\nfrom a large receptive field. Finally, we fuse the features using\nspecially-designed multi-level interactive fusion modules, each of which\nemploys an attention mechanism along with feature interaction for effective\nfeature fusion. Our method detects camouflaged objects with an effective fusion\nstrategy, which aggregates the rich context information from a large receptive\nfield. All of these designs meet the requirements of COD well, allowing the\naccurate detection of camouflaged objects. Extensive experiments on widely-used\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that our method is capable of accurately\ndetecting camouflaged objects and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "The need to accurately estimate the speed of road vehicles is becoming\nincreasingly important for at least two main reasons. First, the number of\nspeed cameras installed worldwide has been growing in recent years, as the\nintroduction and enforcement of appropriate speed limits is considered one of\nthe most effective means to increase the road safety. Second, traffic\nmonitoring and forecasting in road networks plays a fundamental role to enhance\ntraffic, emissions and energy consumption in smart cities, being the speed of\nthe vehicles one of the most relevant parameters of the traffic state. Among\nthe technologies available for the accurate detection of vehicle speed, the use\nof vision-based systems brings great challenges to be solved, but also great\npotential advantages, such as the drastic reduction of costs due to the absence\nof expensive range sensors, and the possibility of identifying vehicles\naccurately. This paper provides a review of vision-based vehicle speed\nestimation. We describe the terminology, the application domains, and propose a\ncomplete taxonomy of a large selection of works that categorizes all stages\ninvolved.

We used a conventional support vector machine (SVM)\nand a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) approach based on structural MRI\nscans that underwent either minimal pre-processing or more extensive\npre-processing into modulated gray matter (GM) maps. Classifiers were optimized\nand evaluated using cross-validation in the ADNI (334 AD, 520 CN). Trained\nclassifiers were subsequently applied to predict conversion to AD in ADNI MCI\npatients (231 converters, 628 non-converters) and in the independent Health-RI\nParelsnoer data set. From this multi-center study representing a tertiary\nmemory clinic population, we included 199 AD patients, 139 participants with\nsubjective cognitive decline, 48 MCI patients converting to dementia, and 91\nMCI patients who did not convert to dementia. AD-CN classification based on\nmodulated GM maps resulted in a similar AUC for SVM (0.940) and CNN (0.933).\nApplication to conversion prediction in MCI yielded significantly higher\nperformance for SVM (0.756) than for CNN (0.742). In external validation,\nperformance was slightly decreased. For AD-CN, it again gave similar AUCs for\nSVM (0.896) and CNN (0.876). For prediction in MCI, performances decreased for\nboth SVM (0.665) and CNN (0.702). Both with SVM and CNN, classification based\non modulated GM maps significantly outperformed classification based on\nminimally processed images. Deep and conventional classifiers performed equally\nwell for AD classification and their performance decreased only slightly when\napplied to the external cohort. We expect that this work on external validation\ncontributes towards translation of machine learning to clinical practice.",

          "description": "Active stereo cameras that recover depth from structured light captures have\nbecome a cornerstone sensor modality for 3D scene reconstruction and\nunderstanding tasks across application domains. Existing active stereo cameras\nproject a pseudo-random dot pattern on object surfaces to extract disparity\nindependently of object texture. Such hand-crafted patterns are designed in\nisolation from the scene statistics, ambient illumination conditions, and the\nreconstruction method. In this work, we propose the first method to jointly\nlearn structured illumination and reconstruction, parameterized by a\ndiffractive optical element and a neural network, in an end-to-end fashion. To\nthis end, we introduce a novel differentiable image formation model for active\nstereo, relying on both wave and geometric optics, and a novel trinocular\nreconstruction network. The jointly optimized pattern, which we dub \"Polka\nLines,\" together with the reconstruction network, achieve state-of-the-art\nactive-stereo depth estimates across imaging conditions. We validate the\nproposed method in simulation and on a hardware prototype, and show that our\nmethod outperforms existing active stereo systems.",

From the perspective of space mapping, prevalent methods of\ndynamic routing didn't consider how inference paths would be distributed in the\nrouting space. Thus, we propose a novel method, termed CoDiNet, to model the\nrelationship between a sample space and a routing space by regularizing the\ndistribution of routing paths with the properties of consistency and diversity.\nSpecifically, samples with similar semantics should be mapped into the same\narea in routing space, while those with dissimilar semantics should be mapped\ninto different areas.

          "description": "Chest X-rays are the most commonly available and affordable radiological\nexamination for screening thoracic diseases. According to the domain knowledge\nof screening chest X-rays, the pathological information usually lay on the lung\nand heart regions. However, it is costly to acquire region-level annotation in\npractice, and model training mainly relies on image-level class labels in a\nweakly supervised manner, which is highly challenging for computer-aided chest\nX-ray screening. To address this issue, some methods have been proposed\nrecently to identify local regions containing pathological information, which\nis vital for thoracic disease classification. Inspired by this, we propose a\nnovel deep learning framework to explore discriminative information from lung\nand heart regions. We design a feature extractor equipped with a multi-scale\nattention module to learn global attention maps from global images. To exploit\ndisease-specific cues effectively, we locate lung and heart regions containing\npathological information by a well-trained pixel-wise segmentation model to\ngenerate binarization masks. By introducing element-wise logical AND operator\non the learned global attention maps and the binarization masks, we obtain\nlocal attention maps in which pixels are $1$ for lung and heart region and $0$\nfor other regions. By zeroing features of non-lung and heart regions in\nattention maps, we can effectively exploit their disease-specific cues in lung\nand heart regions. Compared to existing methods fusing global and local\nfeatures, we adopt feature weighting to avoid weakening visual cues unique to\nlung and heart regions.

          "description": "Camouflaged object detection (COD) is a challenging task due to the low\nboundary contrast between the object and its surroundings. In addition, the\nappearance of camouflaged objects varies significantly, e.g., object size and\nshape, aggravating the difficulties of accurate COD. In this paper, we propose\na novel Context-aware Cross-level Fusion Network (C2F-Net) to address the\nchallenging COD task. Specifically, we propose an Attention-induced Cross-level\nFusion Module (ACFM) to integrate the multi-level features with informative\nattention coefficients. The fused features are then fed to the proposed\nDual-branch Global Context Module (DGCM), which yields multi-scale feature\nrepresentations for exploiting rich global context information. In C2F-Net, the\ntwo modules are conducted on high-level features using a cascaded manner.\nExtensive experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nour C2F-Net is an effective COD model and outperforms state-of-the-art models\nremarkably.

          "description": "Many neurological diseases are characterized by gradual deterioration of\nbrain structure and function. Large longitudinal MRI datasets have revealed\nsuch deterioration, in part, by applying machine and deep learning to predict\ndiagnosis. A popular approach is to apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\nto extract informative features from each visit of the longitudinal MRI and\nthen use those features to classify each visit via Recurrent Neural Networks\n(RNNs). Such modeling neglects the progressive nature of the disease, which may\nresult in clinically implausible classifications across visits. To avoid this\nissue, we propose to combine features across visits by coupling feature\nextraction with a novel longitudinal pooling layer and enforce consistency of\nthe classification across visits in line with disease progression. We evaluate\nthe proposed method on the longitudinal structural MRIs from three neuroimaging\ndatasets: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N=404), a dataset\ncomposed of 274 normal controls and 329 patients with Alcohol Use Disorder\n(AUD), and 255 youths from the National Consortium on Alcohol and\nNeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA).

          "description": "Animals locomote for various reasons: to search for food, find suitable\nhabitat, pursue prey, escape from predators, or seek a mate. The grand scale of\nbiodiversity contributes to the great locomotory design and mode diversity.\nVarious creatures make use of legs, wings, fins and other means to move through\nthe world. In this report, we refer to the locomotion of general biological\nspecies as biolocomotion. We present a computational approach to detect\nbiolocomotion in unprocessed video.\n\nSignificantly, the motion exhibited by the body parts of a biological entity\nto navigate through an environment can be modeled by a combination of an\noverall positional advance with an overlaid asymmetric oscillatory pattern, a\ndistinctive signature that tends to be absent in non-biological objects in\nlocomotion. We exploit this key trait of positional advance with asymmetric\noscillation along with differences in an object's common motion (extrinsic\nmotion) and localized motion of its parts (intrinsic motion) to detect\nbiolocomotion. An algorithm is developed to measure the presence of these\ntraits in tracked objects to determine if they correspond to a biological\nentity in locomotion. An alternative algorithm, based on generic features\ncombined with learning is assembled out of components from allied areas of\ninvestigation, also is presented as a basis of comparison.\n\nA novel biolocomotion dataset encompassing a wide range of moving biological\nand non-biological objects in natural settings is provided. Also, biolocomotion\nannotations to an extant camouflage animals dataset are provided. Quantitative\nresults indicate that the proposed algorithm considerably outperforms the\nalternative approach, supporting the hypothesis that biolocomotion can be\ndetected reliably based on its distinct signature of positional advance with\nasymmetric oscillation and extrinsic/intrinsic motion dissimilarity.",

To overcome this problem, most existing methods restore low resolution\n(LR) images to high resolution (HR) by super-resolution (SR). However, they\nonly focus on the HR feature extraction and ignore the valid information from\noriginal LR images.

However, a crucial challenge prohibits\ntheir use in practice: Bayesian NNs require a large number of predictions to\nproduce reliable results, leading to a significant increase in computational\ncost. To alleviate this issue, we propose spatial smoothing, a method that\nensembles neighboring feature map points of CNNs.

          "description": "We investigate what grade of sensor data is required for training an\nimitation-learning-based AV planner on human expert demonstration.\nMachine-learned planners are very hungry for training data, which is usually\ncollected using vehicles equipped with the same sensors used for autonomous\noperation. This is costly and non-scalable. If cheaper sensors could be used\nfor collection instead, data availability would go up, which is crucial in a\nfield where data volume requirements are large and availability is small. We\npresent experiments using up to 1000 hours worth of expert demonstration and\nfind that training with 10x lower-quality data outperforms 1x AV-grade data in\nterms of planner performance. The important implication of this is that cheaper\nsensors can indeed be used. This serves to improve data access and democratize\nthe field of imitation-based motion planning. Alongside this, we perform a\nsensitivity analysis of planner performance as a function of perception range,\nfield-of-view, accuracy, and data volume, and the reason why lower-quality data\nstill provide good planning results.",

These artifacts raise many readability issues\nfor current Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) algorithms and severely devalue\ntheir efficiency. In this paper, we propose an end to end architecture based on\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to recover the degraded documents into a\nclean and readable form. Unlike the most well-known document binarization\nmethods, which try to improve the visual quality of the degraded document, the\nproposed architecture integrates a handwritten text recognizer that promotes\nthe generated document image to be more readable. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work to use the text information while binarizing handwritten\ndocuments. Extensive experiments conducted on degraded Arabic and Latin\nhandwritten documents demonstrate the usefulness of integrating the recognizer\nwithin the GAN architecture, which improves both the visual quality and the\nreadability of the degraded document images. Moreover, we outperform the state\nof the art in H-DIBCO 2018 challenge, after fine tuning our pre-trained model\nwith synthetically degraded Latin handwritten images, on this task.",

The\nnew techniques, considered as an advanced form of Artificial Intelligence (AI),\nbring previously unforeseen capabilities. However, they typically come in the\nform of resource-hungry black-boxes (overly complex with little transparency\nregarding the inner workings).

The aim\nof this work is to understand and optimise learned models in video processing\napplications so systems that incorporate them can be used in a more trustworthy\nmanner. In this context, the presented work introduces principles for\nsimplification of learned models targeting improved transparency in\nimplementing machine learning for video production and distribution\napplications.

          "description": "Invasive ductal carcinoma is a prevalent, potentially deadly disease\nassociated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Its malignancy is the\nsecond leading cause of death from cancer in women. The mammogram is an\nextremely useful resource for mass detection and invasive ductal carcinoma\ndiagnosis. We are proposing a method for Invasive ductal carcinoma that will\nuse convolutional neural networks (CNN) on mammograms to assist radiologists in\ndiagnosing the disease. Due to the varying image clarity and structure of\ncertain mammograms, it is difficult to observe major cancer characteristics\nsuch as microcalcification and mass, and it is often difficult to interpret and\ndiagnose these attributes. The aim of this study is to establish a novel method\nfor fully automated feature extraction and classification in invasive ductal\ncarcinoma computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. This article presents a tumor\nclassification algorithm that makes novel use of convolutional neural networks\non breast mammogram images to increase feature extraction and training speed.\nThe algorithm makes two contributions.",

However, for\nsafety-critical systems adversarial robustness should be achieved wrt all\n$l_p$-threat models simultaneously. In this paper we develop a simple and\nefficient training scheme to achieve adversarial robustness against the union\nof $l_p$-threat models. Our novel $l_1+l_\\infty$-AT scheme is based on\ngeometric considerations of the different $l_p$-balls and costs as much as\nnormal adversarial training against a single $l_p$-threat model. Moreover, we\nshow that using our $l_1+l_\\infty$-AT scheme one can fine-tune with just 3\nepochs any $l_p$-robust model (for $p \\in \\{1,2,\\infty\\}$) and achieve multiple\nnorm adversarial robustness. In this way we boost the previous state-of-the-art\nreported for multiple-norm robustness by more than $6\\%$ on CIFAR-10 and report\nup to our knowledge the first ImageNet models with multiple norm robustness.\nMoreover, we study the general transfer of adversarial robustness between\ndifferent threat models and in this way boost the previous SOTA\n$l_1$-robustness on CIFAR-10 by almost $10\\%$.",

          "description": "High resolution data models like grid terrain models made from LiDAR data are\na prerequisite for modern day Geographic Information Systems applications.\nBesides providing the foundation for the very accurate digital terrain models,\nLiDAR data is also extensively used to classify which parts of the considered\nsurface comprise relevant elements like water, buildings and vegetation. In\nthis paper we consider the problem of classifying which areas of a given\nsurface are fortified by for instance, roads, sidewalks, parking spaces, paved\ndriveways and terraces. We consider using LiDAR data and orthophotos, combined\nand alone, to show how well the modern machine learning algorithms Gradient\nBoosted Trees and Convolutional Neural Networks are able to detect fortified\nareas on large real world data. The LiDAR data features, in particular the\nintensity feature that measures the signal strength of the return, that we\nconsider in this project are heavily dependent on the actual LiDAR sensor that\nmade the measurement. This is highly problematic, in particular for the\ngeneralisation capability of pattern matching algorithms, as this means that\ndata features for test data may be very different from the data the model is\ntrained on. We propose an algorithmic solution to this problem by designing a\nneural net embedding architecture that transforms data from all the different\nsensor systems into a new common representation that works as well as if the\ntraining data and test data originated from the same sensor. The final\nalgorithm result has an accuracy above 96 percent, and an AUC score above 0.99.",

This can be\nused for the verification of self-driving system performance without relying on\nexpensive and time-consuming road testing. In particular, we frame the\nsimulation problem as a Markov Process, leveraging deep neural networks to\nmodel both state distribution and transition function. These are trainable\ndirectly from the existing raw observations without the need for any\nhandcrafting in the form of plant or kinematic models. All that is needed is a\ndataset of historical traffic episodes.

We train our system directly from 1,000 hours of\ndriving logs and measure both realism, reactivity of the simulation as the two\nkey properties of the simulation. At the same time, we apply the method to\nevaluate the performance of a recently proposed state-of-the-art ML planning\nsystem trained from human driving logs. We discover this planning system is\nprone to previously unreported causal confusion issues that are difficult to\ntest by non-reactive simulation.

          "description": "Recent advances have shown how deep neural networks can be extremely\neffective at super-resolving remote sensing imagery, starting from a\nmultitemporal collection of low-resolution images. However, existing models\nhave neglected the issue of temporal permutation, whereby the temporal ordering\nof the input images does not carry any relevant information for the\nsuper-resolution task and causes such models to be inefficient with the, often\nscarce, ground truth data that available for training. Thus, models ought not\nto learn feature extractors that rely on temporal ordering. In this paper, we\nshow how building a model that is fully invariant to temporal permutation\nsignificantly improves performance and data efficiency. Moreover, we study how\nto quantify the uncertainty of the super-resolved image so that the final user\nis informed on the local quality of the product. We show how uncertainty\ncorrelates with temporal variation in the series, and how quantifying it\nfurther improves model performance. Experiments on the Proba-V challenge\ndataset show significant improvements over the state of the art without the\nneed for self-ensembling, as well as improved data efficiency, reaching the\nperformance of the challenge winner with just 25% of the training data.",

The topic revolves around people's daily lives (e.g.,\ntravel, shopping, medical care), the most likely SLT application scenario.\nExtensive experimental results and analysis of SLT methods are reported on\nCSL-Daily.

We also study the use of particle filters to\nimprove trackers' accuracy. Our results are experimentally evaluated using a)\nstandard dataset and b) real-time using the Microsoft Kinect V2 sensor. We\nbelieve this work will set the basis for a better understanding of the\neffectiveness of kernel-based correlation filter trackers and to further define\nsome of its possible advantages in tracking.",

          "description": "In this paper, we address the makeup transfer and removal tasks\nsimultaneously, which aim to transfer the makeup from a reference image to a\nsource image and remove the makeup from the with-makeup image respectively.\nExisting methods have achieved much advancement in constrained scenarios, but\nit is still very challenging for them to transfer makeup between images with\nlarge pose and expression differences, or handle makeup details like blush on\ncheeks or highlight on the nose. In addition, they are hardly able to control\nthe degree of makeup during transferring or to transfer a specified part in the\ninput face. In this work, we propose the PSGAN++, which is capable of\nperforming both detail-preserving makeup transfer and effective makeup removal.\nFor makeup transfer, PSGAN++ uses a Makeup Distill Network to extract makeup\ninformation, which is embedded into spatial-aware makeup matrices. We also\ndevise an Attentive Makeup Morphing module that specifies how the makeup in the\nsource image is morphed from the reference image, and a makeup detail loss to\nsupervise the model within the selected makeup detail area. On the other hand,\nfor makeup removal, PSGAN++ applies an Identity Distill Network to embed the\nidentity information from with-makeup images into identity matrices. Finally,\nthe obtained makeup/identity matrices are fed to a Style Transfer Network that\nis able to edit the feature maps to achieve makeup transfer or removal. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of our PSGAN++, we collect a Makeup Transfer In the\nWild dataset that contains images with diverse poses and expressions and a\nMakeup Transfer High-Resolution dataset that contains high-resolution images.\nExperiments demonstrate that PSGAN++ not only achieves state-of-the-art results\nwith fine makeup details even in cases of large pose/expression differences but\nalso can perform partial or degree-controllable makeup transfer.",

Adversarial examples, which are carefully crafted\nwith a malicious purpose, can lead to erroneous predictions, resulting in\ncatastrophic accidents. To mitigate the effects of adversarial attacks, we\npropose a novel purification model called CAP-GAN.

Specifically, we utilize the\nguided attention module and knowledge distillation to convey meaningful\ninformation to the purification model.

We vary the capacity of the adversary to argue the robustness against\nvarious types of attack strategies.

          "description": "Automatically detecting the positions of key-points (e.g., facial key-points\nor finger key-points) in an image is an essential problem in many applications,\nsuch as driver's gaze detection and drowsiness detection in automated driving\nsystems. With the recent advances of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Key-Points\ndetection DNNs (KP-DNNs) have been increasingly employed for that purpose.\nNevertheless, KP-DNN testing and validation have remained a challenging problem\nbecause KP-DNNs predict many independent key-points at the same time -- where\neach individual key-point may be critical in the targeted application -- and\nimages can vary a great deal according to many factors.\n\nIn this paper, we present an approach to automatically generate test data for\nKP-DNNs using many-objective search. In our experiments, focused on facial\nkey-points detection DNNs developed for an industrial automotive application,\nwe show that our approach can generate test suites to severely mispredict, on\naverage, more than 93% of all key-points. In comparison, random search-based\ntest data generation can only severely mispredict 41% of them. Many of these\nmispredictions, however, are not avoidable and should not therefore be\nconsidered failures. We also empirically compare state-of-the-art,\nmany-objective search algorithms and their variants, tailored for test suite\ngeneration. Furthermore, we investigate and demonstrate how to learn specific\nconditions, based on image characteristics (e.g., head posture and skin color),\nthat lead to severe mispredictions. Such conditions serve as a basis for risk\nanalysis or DNN retraining.",

          "description": "Photoacoustic (PA) computed tomography (PACT) reconstructs the initial\npressure distribution from raw PA signals. The standard reconstruction of\nmedical image could cause the artifacts due to interferences or ill-posed\nsetup. Recently, deep learning has been used to reconstruct the PA image with\nill-posed conditions. Most works remove the artifacts from image domain, and\ncompensate the limited-view from dataset. In this paper, we propose a jointed\nfeature fusion framework (JEFF-Net) based on deep learning to reconstruct the\nPA image using limited-view data. The cross-domain features from limited-view\nposition-wise data and the reconstructed image are fused by a backtracked\nsupervision. Specifically, our results could generate superior performance,\nwhose artifacts are drastically reduced in the output compared to ground-truth\n(full-view reconstructed result). In this paper, a quarter position-wise data\n(32 channels) is fed into model, which outputs another 3-quarters-view data (96\nchannels). Moreover, two novel losses are designed to restrain the artifacts by\nsufficiently manipulating superposed data. The numerical and in-vivo results\nhave demonstrated the superior performance of our method to reconstruct the\nfull-view image without artifacts. Finally, quantitative evaluations show that\nour proposed method outperformed the ground-truth in some metrics.",

          "description": "Rotation detection serves as a fundamental building block in many visual\napplications involving aerial image, scene text, and face etc. Differing from\nthe dominant regression-based approaches for orientation estimation, this paper\nexplores a relatively less-studied methodology based on classification. The\nhope is to inherently dismiss the boundary discontinuity issue as encountered\nby the regression-based detectors. We propose new techniques to push its\nfrontier in two aspects: i) new encoding mechanism: the design of two Densely\nCoded Labels (DCL) for angle classification, to replace the Sparsely Coded\nLabel (SCL) in existing classification-based detectors, leading to three times\ntraining speed increase as empirically observed across benchmarks, further with\nnotable improvement in detection accuracy; ii) loss re-weighting: we propose\nAngle Distance and Aspect Ratio Sensitive Weighting (ADARSW), which improves\nthe detection accuracy especially for square-like objects, by making DCL-based\ndetectors sensitive to angular distance and object's aspect ratio. Extensive\nexperiments and visual analysis on large-scale public datasets for aerial\nimages i.e. DOTA, UCAS-AOD, HRSC2016, as well as scene text dataset ICDAR2015\nand MLT, show the effectiveness of our approach.

Here, these annotations correspond to the 3D coordinates of\na set of pre-defined facial landmarks. However, this annotation process, be it\nmanual or automatic, is rarely error-free, which strongly biases the analysis.\nIn contrast, we propose a fully unsupervised methodology based on robust\nstatistics and a parametric confidence test. We revisit the problem of robust\nestimation of the rigid transformation between two point sets and we describe\ntwo algorithms, one based on a mixture between a Gaussian and a uniform\ndistribution, and another one based on the generalized Student's\nt-distribution. We show that these methods are robust to up to 50% outliers,\nwhich makes them suitable for mapping a face, from an unknown pose to a frontal\npose, in the presence of facial expressions and occlusions. Using these methods\nin conjunction with large datasets of face images, we build a statistical\nfrontal facial model and an associated parametric confidence metric, eventually\nused for performance analysis. We empirically show that the proposed pipeline\nis neither method-biased nor data-biased, and that it can be used to assess\nboth the performance of 3DFA algorithms and the accuracy of annotations of face\ndatasets.",

          "description": "While deep learning strategies achieve outstanding results in computer vision\ntasks, one issue remains: The current strategies rely heavily on a huge amount\nof labeled data. In many real-world problems, it is not feasible to create such\nan amount of labeled training data. Therefore, it is common to incorporate\nunlabeled data into the training process to reach equal results with fewer\nlabels. Due to a lot of concurrent research, it is difficult to keep track of\nrecent developments. In this survey, we provide an overview of often used ideas\nand methods in image classification with fewer labels. We compare 34 methods in\ndetail based on their performance and their commonly used ideas rather than a\nfine-grained taxonomy. In our analysis, we identify three major trends that\nlead to future research opportunities. 1. State-of-the-art methods are\nscaleable to real-world applications in theory but issues like class imbalance,\nrobustness, or fuzzy labels are not considered. 2. The degree of supervision\nwhich is needed to achieve comparable results to the usage of all labels is\ndecreasing and therefore methods need to be extended to settings with a\nvariable number of classes. 3. All methods share some common ideas but we\nidentify clusters of methods that do not share many ideas. We show that\ncombining ideas from different clusters can lead to better performance.",

          "description": "We synthesize both optical RGB and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote\nsensing images from land cover maps and auxiliary raster data using generative\nadversarial networks (GANs). In remote sensing, many types of data, such as\ndigital elevation models (DEMs) or precipitation maps, are often not reflected\nin land cover maps but still influence image content or structure. Including\nsuch data in the synthesis process increases the quality of the generated\nimages and exerts more control on their characteristics. Spatially adaptive\nnormalization layers fuse both inputs and are applied to a full-blown generator\narchitecture consisting of encoder and decoder to take full advantage of the\ninformation content in the auxiliary raster data. Our method successfully\nsynthesizes medium (10 m) and high (1 m) resolution images when trained with\nthe corresponding data set. We show the advantage of data fusion of land cover\nmaps and auxiliary information using mean intersection over unions (mIoUs),\npixel accuracy, and Fr\\'echet inception distances (FIDs) using pretrained U-Net\nsegmentation models. Handpicked images exemplify how fusing information avoids\nambiguities in the synthesized images.

Predicting the labels and the captions of future\nactivities where no frames of the predicted activities have been observed is a\nchallenging problem, with important applications that require anticipatory\nresponse. In this work, we propose a system that can infer the labels and the\ncaptions of a sequence of future activities. Our proposed network for label\nprediction of a future activity sequence has three branches where the first\nbranch takes visual features from the objects present in the scene, the second\nbranch takes observed sequential activity features, and the third branch\ncaptures the last observed activity features. The predicted labels and the\nobserved scene context are then mapped to meaningful captions using a\nsequence-to-sequence learning-based method. Experiments on four challenging\nactivity analysis datasets and a video description dataset demonstrate that our\nlabel prediction approach achieves comparable performance with the\nstate-of-the-arts and our captioning framework outperform the\nstate-of-the-arts.",

          "description": "Depth maps captured with commodity sensors are often of low quality and\nresolution; these maps need to be enhanced to be used in many applications.\nState-of-the-art data-driven methods of depth map super-resolution rely on\nregistered pairs of low- and high-resolution depth maps of the same scenes.\nAcquisition of real-world paired data requires specialized setups. Another\nalternative, generating low-resolution maps from high-resolution maps by\nsubsampling, adding noise and other artificial degradation methods, does not\nfully capture the characteristics of real-world low-resolution images. As a\nconsequence, supervised learning methods trained on such artificial paired data\nmay not perform well on real-world low-resolution inputs. We consider an\napproach to depth map enhancement based on learning from unpaired data. While\nmany techniques for unpaired image-to-image translation have been proposed,\nmost are not directly applicable to depth maps. We propose an unpaired learning\nmethod for simultaneous depth enhancement and super-resolution, which is based\non a learnable degradation model and surface normal estimates as features to\nproduce more accurate depth maps. We demonstrate that our method outperforms\nexisting unpaired methods and performs on par with paired methods on a new\nbenchmark for unpaired learning that we developed.",

          "description": "Existing deep learning methods for diagnosis of gastric cancer commonly use\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN). Recently, the Visual Transformer (VT) has\nattracted a major attention because of its performance and efficiency, but its\napplications are mostly in the field of computer vision. In this paper, a\nmulti-scale visual transformer model, referred to as GasHis-Transformer, is\nproposed for gastric histopathology image classification (GHIC), which enables\nthe automatic classification of microscopic gastric images into abnormal and\nnormal cases. The GasHis-Transformer model consists of two key modules: a\nglobal information module (GIM) and a local information module (LIM) to extract\npathological features effectively. In our experiments, a public hematoxylin and\neosin (H&E) stained gastric histopathology dataset with 280 abnormal or normal\nimages using the GasHis-Transformer model is applied to estimate precision,\nrecall, F1-score, and accuracy on the testing set as 98.0%, 100.0%, 96.0% and\n98.0% respectively. Furthermore, a critical study is conducted to evaluate the\nrobustness of GasHis-Transformer according to add ten different noises\nincluding adversarial attack and traditional image noise. In addition, a\nclinically meaningful study is executed to test the gastric cancer\nidentification of GasHis-Transformerwith 420 abnormal images and achieves 96.2%\naccuracy. Finally, a comparative study is performed to test the\ngeneralizability with both H&E and Immunohistochemical (IHC) stained images on\na lymphoma image dataset, a breast cancer dataset and a cervical cancer\ndataset, producing comparable F1-scores (85.6%, 82.8% and 65.7%, respectively)\nand accuracy (83.9%, 89.4% and 65.7%, respectively) respectively. In\nconclusion, GasHis-Transformerdemonstrates a high classification performance\nand shows its significant potential in histopathology image analysis.",

          "description": "Few-shot learning is a challenging task since only few instances are given\nfor recognizing an unseen class.

In this\npaper, we show that such inductive bias can be learned from a flat collection\nof unlabeled images, and instantiated as transferable representations among\nseen and unseen classes. Specifically, we propose a novel part-based\nself-supervised representation learning scheme to learn transferable\nrepresentations by maximizing the similarity of an image to its discriminative\npart. To mitigate the overfitting in few-shot classification caused by data\nscarcity, we further propose a part augmentation strategy by retrieving extra\nimages from a base dataset. We conduct systematic studies on miniImageNet and\ntieredImageNet benchmarks. Remarkably, our method yields impressive results,\noutperforming the previous best unsupervised methods by 7.74% and 9.24% under\n5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot settings, which are comparable with\nstate-of-the-art supervised methods.",

          "description": "Deep learning networks have shown promising performance for accurate object\nlocalization in medial images, but require large amount of annotated data for\nsupervised training, which is expensive and expertise burdensome. To address\nthis problem, we present a one-shot framework for organ and landmark\nlocalization in volumetric medical images, which does not need any annotation\nduring the training stage and could be employed to locate any landmarks or\norgans in test images given a support (reference) image during the inference\nstage. Our main idea comes from that tissues and organs from different human\nbodies have a similar relative position and context. Therefore, we could\npredict the relative positions of their non-local patches, thus locate the\ntarget organ. Our framework is composed of three parts: (1) A projection\nnetwork trained to predict the 3D offset between any two patches from the same\nvolume, where human annotations are not required. In the inference stage, it\ntakes one given landmark in a reference image as a support patch and predicts\nthe offset from a random patch to the corresponding landmark in the test\n(query) volume. (2) A coarse-to-fine framework contains two projection\nnetworks, providing more accurate localization of the target. (3) Based on the\ncoarse-to-fine model, we transfer the organ boundingbox (B-box) detection to\nlocating six extreme points along x, y and z directions in the query volume.\nExperiments on multi-organ localization from head-and-neck (HaN) CT volumes\nshowed that our method acquired competitive performance in real time, which is\nmore accurate and 10^5 times faster than template matching methods with the\nsame setting.

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved remarkable success in computer\nvision (CV). However, training and inference of DNN models are both memory and\ncomputation intensive, incurring significant overhead in terms of energy\nconsumption and silicon area. In particular, inference is much more\ncost-sensitive than training because training can be done offline with powerful\nplatforms, while inference may have to be done on battery powered devices with\nconstrained form factors, especially for mobile or edge vision applications. In\norder to accelerate DNN inference, model quantization was proposed. However\nprevious works only focus on the quantization rate without considering the\nefficiency of operations. In this paper, we propose Dendrite-Tree based Neural\nNetwork (DTNN) for energy-efficient inference with table lookup operations\nenabled by activation quantization. In DTNN both costly weight access and\narithmetic computations are eliminated for inference. We conducted experiments\non various kinds of DNN models such as LeNet-5, MobileNet, VGG, and ResNet with\ndifferent datasets, including MNIST, Cifar10/Cifar100, SVHN, and ImageNet. DTNN\nachieved significant energy saving (19.4X and 64.9X improvement on ResNet-18\nand VGG-11 with ImageNet, respectively) with negligible loss of accuracy. To\nfurther validate the effectiveness of DTNN and compare with state-of-the-art\nlow energy implementation for edge vision, we design and implement DTNN based\nMLP image classifiers using off-the-shelf FPGAs. The results show that DTNN on\nthe FPGA, with higher accuracy, could achieve orders of magnitude better energy\nconsumption and latency compared with the state-of-the-art low energy\napproaches reported that use ASIC chips.",

          "description": "Automatic lesion segmentation on thoracic CT enables rapid quantitative\nanalysis of lung involvement in COVID- 19 infections. Obtaining voxel-level\nannotations for training segmentation networks is prohibitively expensive.\nTherefore we propose a weakly-supervised segmentation method based on dense\nregression activation maps (dRAM). Most advanced weakly supervised segmentation\napproaches exploit class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects generated\nfrom high-level semantic features at a coarse resolution. As a result, CAMs\nprovide coarse outlines that do not align precisely with the object\nsegmentations. Instead, we exploit dense features from a segmentation network\nto compute dense regression activation maps (dRAMs) for preserving local\ndetails. During training, dRAMs are pooled lobe-wise to regress the per-lobe\nlesion percentage. In such a way, the network achieves additional information\nregarding the lesion quantification in comparison with the classification\napproach. Furthermore, we refine dRAMs based on an attention module and dense\nconditional random field trained together with the main regression task. The\nrefined dRAMs are served as the pseudo labels for training a final segmentation\nnetwork.

          "description": "Recovering the 3D geometry of a purely texture-less object with generally\nunknown surface reflectance (e.g. non-Lambertian) is regarded as a challenging\ntask in multi-view reconstruction. The major obstacle revolves around\nestablishing cross-view correspondences where photometric constancy is\nviolated. This paper proposes a simple and practical solution to overcome this\nchallenge based on a co-located camera-light scanner device. Unlike existing\nsolutions, we do not explicitly solve for correspondence. Instead, we argue the\nproblem is generally well-posed by multi-view geometrical and photometric\nconstraints, and can be solved from a small number of input views. We formulate\nthe reconstruction task as a joint energy minimization over the surface\ngeometry and reflectance. Despite this energy is highly non-convex, we develop\nan optimization algorithm that robustly recovers globally optimal shape and\nreflectance even from a random initialization. Extensive experiments on both\nsimulated and real data have validated our method, and possible future\nextensions are discussed.",

          "description": "Depth cameras are emerging as a cornerstone modality with diverse\napplications that directly or indirectly rely on measured depth, including\npersonal devices, robotics, and self-driving vehicles. Although time-of-flight\n(ToF) methods have fueled these applications, the precision and robustness of\nToF methods is limited by relying on photon time-tagging or modulation after\nphoto-conversion. Successful optical modulation approaches have been restricted\nfiber-coupled modulation with large coupling losses or interferometric\nmodulation with sub-cm range, and the precision gap between interferometric\nmethods and ToF methods is more than three orders of magnitudes. In this work,\nwe close this gap and propose a computational imaging method for all-optical\nfree-space correlation before photo-conversion that achieves micron-scale depth\nresolution with robustness to surface reflectance and ambient light with\nconventional silicon intensity sensors. To this end, we solve two technical\nchallenges: modulating at GHz rates and computational phase unwrapping. We\npropose an imaging approach with resonant polarization modulators and devise a\nnovel optical dual-pass frequency-doubling which achieves high modulation\ncontrast at more than 10GHz. At the same time, centimeter-wave modulation\ntogether with a small modulation bandwidth render existing phase unwrapping\nmethods ineffective. We tackle this problem with a neural phase unwrapping\nmethod that exploits that adjacent wraps are often highly correlated. We\nvalidate the proposed method in simulation and experimentally, where it\nachieves micron-scale depth precision. We demonstrate precise depth sensing\nindependently of surface texture and ambient light and compare against existing\nanalog demodulation methods, which we outperform across all tested scenarios.",

We compare three different approaches to obtaining probabilistic\nmodels based on convolutional neural networks in a Bayesian formalism, namely\nDeep Ensembles, Concrete Dropout, and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian\n(SWAG). These methods are consistently applied to fault detection case studies\nwhere Deep Ensembles use independently trained models to provide fault\nprobabilities, Concrete Dropout represents an extension to the popular Dropout\ntechnique to approximate Bayesian neural networks, and finally, we apply SWAG,\na recent method that is based on the Bayesian inference equivalence of\nmini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent. We provide quantitative results in\nterms of model calibration and uncertainty representation, as well as\nqualitative results on synthetic and real seismic datasets.

          "description": "Recent breakthroughs of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) extend the field's\nresearch scope towards a broader range of vision tasks and more diversified\nsearch spaces. While existing NAS methods mostly design architectures on a\nsingle task, algorithms that look beyond single-task search are surging to\npursue a more efficient and universal solution across various tasks. Many of\nthem leverage transfer learning and seek to preserve, reuse, and refine network\ndesign knowledge to achieve higher efficiency in future tasks. However, the\nenormous computational cost and experiment complexity of cross-task NAS are\nimposing barriers for valuable research in this direction. Existing NAS\nbenchmarks all focus on one type of vision task, i.e., classification. In this\nwork, we propose TransNAS-Bench-101, a benchmark dataset containing network\nperformance across seven tasks, covering classification, regression,\npixel-level prediction, and self-supervised tasks. This diversity provides\nopportunities to transfer NAS methods among tasks and allows for more complex\ntransfer schemes to evolve. We explore two fundamentally different types of\nsearch space: cell-level search space and macro-level search space. With 7,352\nbackbones evaluated on seven tasks, 51,464 trained models with detailed\ntraining information are provided. With TransNAS-Bench-101, we hope to\nencourage the advent of exceptional NAS algorithms that raise cross-task search\nefficiency and generalizability to the next level. Our dataset file will be\navailable at Mindspore, VEGA.",

          "description": "Person re-identification (re-ID) tackles the problem of matching person\nimages with the same identity from different cameras. In practical\napplications, due to the differences in camera performance and distance between\ncameras and persons of interest, captured person images usually have various\nresolutions. We name this problem as Cross-Resolution Person Re-identification\nwhich brings a great challenge for matching correctly. In this paper, we\npropose a Deep High-Resolution Pseudo-Siamese Framework (PS-HRNet) to solve the\nabove problem. Specifically, in order to restore the resolution of\nlow-resolution images and make reasonable use of different channel information\nof feature maps, we introduce and innovate VDSR module with channel attention\n(CA) mechanism, named as VDSR-CA. Then we reform the HRNet by designing a novel\nrepresentation head to extract discriminating features, named as HRNet-ReID. In\naddition, a pseudo-siamese framework is constructed to reduce the difference of\nfeature distributions between low-resolution images and high-resolution images.\nThe experimental results on five cross-resolution person datasets verify the\neffectiveness of our proposed approach. Compared with the state-of-the-art\nmethods, our proposed PS-HRNet improves 3.4\\%, 6.2\\%, 2.5\\%,1.1\\% and 4.2\\% at\nRank-1 on MLR-Market-1501, MLR-CUHK03, MLR-VIPeR, MLR-DukeMTMC-reID, and CAVIAR\ndatasets, respectively.

It has been an\nintuitive and widely used technique to construct a steerable filter by\naugmenting a filter with its transformed copies in the past decades, which is\nnamed as filter transform in this paper. Recently, the problem of steerable CNN\nhas been studied from aspect of group representation theory, which reveals the\nfunction space structure of a steerable kernel function.

          "description": "The ubiquity of mobile phones makes mobile GUI understanding an important\ntask. Most previous works in this domain require human-created metadata of\nscreens (e.g. View Hierarchy) during inference, which unfortunately is often\nnot available or reliable enough for GUI understanding. Inspired by the\nimpressive success of Transformers in NLP tasks, targeting for purely\nvision-based GUI understanding, we extend the concepts of Words/Sentence to\nPixel-Words/Screen-Sentence, and propose a mobile GUI understanding\narchitecture: Pixel-Words to Screen-Sentence (PW2SS). In analogy to the\nindividual Words, we define the Pixel-Words as atomic visual components (text\nand graphic components), which are visually consistent and semantically clear\nacross screenshots of a large variety of design styles. The Pixel-Words\nextracted from a screenshot are aggregated into Screen-Sentence with a Screen\nTransformer proposed to model their relations. Since the Pixel-Words are\ndefined as atomic visual components, the ambiguity between their visual\nappearance and semantics is dramatically reduced. We are able to make use of\nmetadata available in training data to auto-generate high-quality annotations\nfor Pixel-Words. A dataset, RICO-PW, of screenshots with Pixel-Words\nannotations is built based on the public RICO dataset, which will be released\nto help to address the lack of high-quality training data in this area. We\ntrain a detector to extract Pixel-Words from screenshots on this dataset and\nachieve metadata-free GUI understanding during inference. We conduct\nexperiments and show that Pixel-Words can be well extracted on RICO-PW and well\ngeneralized to a new dataset, P2S-UI, collected by ourselves. The effectiveness\nof PW2SS is further verified in the GUI understanding tasks including relation\nprediction, clickability prediction, screen retrieval, and app type\nclassification.",

To classify query\ninstances from novel classes encountered at test-time, they only require a\nsupport set composed of a few labelled samples. FSL benchmarks commonly assume\nthat those queries come from the same distribution as instances in the support\nset. However, in a realistic set-ting, data distribution is plausibly subject\nto change, a situation referred to as Distribution Shift (DS). The present work\naddresses the new and challenging problem of Few-Shot Learning under\nSupport/Query Shift (FSQS) i.e., when support and query instances are sampled\nfrom related but different distributions. Our contributions are the following.\nFirst, we release a testbed for FSQS, including datasets, relevant baselines\nand a protocol for a rigorous and reproducible evaluation. Second, we observe\nthat well-established FSL algorithms unsurprisingly suffer from a considerable\ndrop in accuracy when facing FSQS, stressing the significance of our study.\nFinally, we show that transductive algorithms can limit the inopportune effect\nof DS. In particular, we study both the role of Batch-Normalization and Optimal\nTransport (OT) in aligning distributions, bridging Unsupervised Domain\nAdaptation with FSL. This results in a new method that efficiently combines OT\nwith the celebrated Prototypical Networks. We bring compelling experiments\ndemonstrating the advantage of our method.

A common way to tackle this difficulty is\nto approximate the tensor rank with the $\\ell_1-$norm of singular values based\non its Tensor Singular Value Decomposition (T-SVD). Besides, the sparsity of a\ntensor is also measured by its $\\ell_1-$norm. However, the $\\ell_1$ penalty is\nessentially biased and thus the result will deviate. In order to sidestep the\nbias, we propose a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate function and a novel\nnon-convex sparsity measure. In this new setting by using the concavity instead\nof the convexity, a majorization minimization algorithm is further designed for\ntensor completion and robust principal component analysis. Furthermore, we\nanalyze its theoretical properties. Finally, the experiments on natural and\nhyperspectral images demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed\nmethod.",

          "description": "Transformer networks are effective at modeling long-range contextual\ninformation and have recently demonstrated exemplary performance in the natural\nlanguage processing domain. Conventionally, the temporal action proposal\ngeneration (TAPG) task is divided into two main sub-tasks: boundary prediction\nand proposal confidence prediction, which rely on the frame-level dependencies\nand proposal-level relationships separately. To capture the dependencies at\ndifferent levels of granularity, this paper intuitively presents a unified\ntemporal action proposal generation framework with original Transformers,\ncalled TAPG Transformer, which consists of a Boundary Transformer and a\nProposal Transformer. Specifically, the Boundary Transformer captures long-term\ntemporal dependencies to predict precise boundary information and the Proposal\nTransformer learns the rich inter-proposal relationships for reliable\nconfidence evaluation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two popular\nbenchmarks: ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS14, and the results demonstrate that TAPG\nTransformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Equipped with the existing\naction classifier, our method achieves remarkable performance on the temporal\naction localization task. Codes and models will be available.",

We require that the probe and\ngallery images be represented in terms of a fixed-length representation, which\nis typical for representations obtained from learned networks. Our encryption\nscheme is agnostic to how the fixed-length representation is obtained and can\ntherefore be applied to any fixed-length representation in any application\ndomain. Our method, dubbed HERS (Homomorphically Encrypted Representation\nSearch), operates by (i) compressing the representation towards its estimated\nintrinsic dimensionality with minimal loss of accuracy (ii) encrypting the\ncompressed representation using the proposed fully homomorphic encryption\nscheme, and (iii) efficiently searching against a gallery of encrypted\nrepresentations directly in the encrypted domain, without decrypting them.\nNumerical results on large galleries of face, fingerprint, and object datasets\nsuch as ImageNet show that, for the first time, accurate and fast image search\nwithin the encrypted domain is feasible at scale (500 seconds; $275\\times$\nspeed up over state-of-the-art for encrypted search against a gallery of 100\nmillion).",

          "description": "Creating intelligent systems capable of recognizing emotions is a difficult\ntask, especially when looking at emotions in animals. This paper describes the\nprocess of designing a \"proof of concept\" system to recognize emotions in\nhorses. This system is formed by two elements, a detector and a model. The\ndetector is a faster region-based convolutional neural network that detects\nhorses in an image. The second one, the model, is a convolutional neural\nnetwork that predicts the emotion of those horses. These two models were\ntrained with multiple images of horses until they achieved high accuracy in\ntheir tasks, creating therefore the desired system. 400 images of horses were\nused to train both the detector and the model while 80 were used to validate\nthe system. Once the two components were validated they were combined into a\ntestable system that would detect equine emotions based on established\nbehavioral ethograms indicating emotional affect through head, neck, ear,\nmuzzle, and eye position. The system showed an accuracy of between 69% and 74%\non the validation set, demonstrating that it is possible to predict emotions in\nanimals using autonomous intelligent systems. It is a first \"proof of concept\"\napproach that can be enhanced in many ways. Such a system has multiple\napplications including further studies in the growing field of animal emotions\nas well as in the veterinary field to determine the physical welfare of horses\nor other livestock.",

          "description": "Long-range and short-range temporal modeling are two complementary and\ncrucial aspects of video recognition. Most of the state-of-the-arts focus on\nshort-range spatio-temporal modeling and then average multiple snippet-level\npredictions to yield the final video-level prediction. Thus, their video-level\nprediction does not consider spatio-temporal features of how video evolves\nalong the temporal dimension. In this paper, we introduce a novel Dynamic\nSegment Aggregation (DSA) module to capture relationship among snippets. To be\nmore specific, we attempt to generate a dynamic kernel for a convolutional\noperation to aggregate long-range temporal information among adjacent snippets\nadaptively. The DSA module is an efficient plug-and-play module and can be\ncombined with the off-the-shelf clip-based models (i.e., TSM, I3D) to perform\npowerful long-range modeling with minimal overhead. The final video\narchitecture, coined as DSANet. We conduct extensive experiments on several\nvideo recognition benchmarks (i.e., Mini-Kinetics-200, Kinetics-400,\nSomething-Something V1 and ActivityNet) to show its superiority. Our proposed\nDSA module is shown to benefit various video recognition models significantly.\nFor example, equipped with DSA modules, the top-1 accuracy of I3D ResNet-50 is\nimproved from 74.9% to 78.2% on Kinetics-400.

The goal is to learn an embedding of images and recipes in a common\nfeature space, such that the corresponding image-recipe embeddings lie close to\none another. Two major challenges in addressing this problem are 1) large\nintra-variance and small inter-variance across cross-modal food data; and 2)\ndifficulties in obtaining discriminative recipe representations. To address\nthese two problems, we propose Semantic-Consistent and Attention-based Networks\n(SCAN), which regularize the embeddings of the two modalities through aligning\noutput semantic probabilities. Besides, we exploit a self-attention mechanism\nto improve the embedding of recipes.

          "description": "Reinforcement learning (RL)-based neural architecture search (NAS) generally\nguarantees better convergence yet suffers from the requirement of huge\ncomputational resources compared with gradient-based approaches, due to the\nrollout bottleneck -- exhaustive training for each sampled generation on proxy\ntasks. In this paper, we propose a general pipeline to accelerate the\nconvergence of the rollout process as well as the RL process in NAS. It is\nmotivated by the interesting observation that both the architecture and the\nparameter knowledge can be transferred between different experiments and even\ndifferent tasks. We first introduce an uncertainty-aware critic (value\nfunction) in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to utilize the architecture\nknowledge in previous experiments, which stabilizes the training process and\nreduces the searching time by 4 times. Further, an architecture knowledge pool\ntogether with a block similarity function is proposed to utilize parameter\nknowledge and reduces the searching time by 2 times. It is the first to\nintroduce block-level weight sharing in RLbased NAS. The block similarity\nfunction guarantees a 100% hitting ratio with strict fairness. Besides, we show\nthat a simply designed off-policy correction factor used in \"replay buffer\" in\nRL optimization can further reduce half of the searching time. Experiments on\nthe Mobile Neural Architecture Search (MNAS) search space show the proposed\nFast Neural Architecture Search (FNAS) accelerates standard RL-based NAS\nprocess by ~10x (e.g. ~256 2x2 TPUv2 x days / 20,000 GPU x hour -> 2,000 GPU x\nhour for MNAS), and guarantees better performance on various vision tasks.",

          "description": "Light can undergo complex interactions with multiple scene surfaces of\ndifferent material types before being reflected towards a detector. During this\ntransport, every surface reflection and propagation is encoded in the\nproperties of the photons that ultimately reach the detector, including travel\ntime, direction, intensity, wavelength and polarization. Conventional imaging\nsystems capture intensity by integrating over all other dimensions of the light\ninto a single quantity, hiding this rich scene information in the accumulated\nmeasurements. Existing methods can untangle these into their spatial and\ntemporal dimensions, fueling geometric scene understanding. However, examining\npolarimetric material properties jointly with geometric properties is an open\nchallenge that could enable unprecedented capabilities beyond geometric\nunderstanding, allowing to incorporate material-dependent semantics. In this\nwork, we propose a computational light-transport imaging method that captures\nthe spatially- and temporally-resolved complete polarimetric response of a\nscene. Our method hinges on a novel 7D tensor theory of light transport. We\ndiscover low-rank structures in the polarimetric tensor dimension and propose a\ndata-driven rotating ellipsometry method that learns to exploit redundancy of\nthe polarimetric structures. We instantiate our theory in two imaging\nprototypes: spatio-polarimetric imaging and coaxial temporal-polarimetric\nimaging. This allows us to decompose scene light transport into temporal,\nspatial, and complete polarimetric dimensions that unveil scene properties\nhidden to conventional methods. We validate the applicability of our method on\ndiverse tasks, including shape reconstruction with subsurface scattering,\nseeing through scattering medium, untangling multi-bounce light transport,\nbreaking metamerism with polarization, and spatio-polarimetric decomposition of\ncrystals.",

          "description": "Early-stage plant density is an essential trait that determines the fate of a\ngenotype under given environmental conditions and management practices. The use\nof RGB images taken from UAVs may replace traditional visual counting in fields\nwith improved throughput, accuracy and access to plant localization. However,\nhigh-resolution (HR) images are required to detect small plants present at\nearly stages. This study explores the impact of image ground sampling distance\n(GSD) on the performances of maize plant detection at 3-5 leaves stage using\nFaster-RCNN. Data collected at HR (GSD=0.3cm) over 6 contrasted sites were used\nfor model training. Two additional sites with images acquired both at high and\nlow (GSD=0.6cm) resolution were used for model evaluation. Results show that\nFaster-RCNN achieved very good plant detection and counting (rRMSE=0.08)\nperformances when native HR images are used both for training and validation.\nSimilarly, good performances were observed (rRMSE=0.11) when the model is\ntrained over synthetic low-resolution (LR) images obtained by down-sampling the\nnative training HR images, and applied to the synthetic LR validation images.\nConversely, poor performances are obtained when the model is trained on a given\nspatial resolution and applied to another spatial resolution. Training on a mix\nof HR and LR images allows to get very good performances on the native HR\n(rRMSE=0.06) and synthetic LR (rRMSE=0.10) images. However, very low\nperformances are still observed over the native LR images (rRMSE=0.48), mainly\ndue to the poor quality of the native LR images. Finally, an advanced\nsuper-resolution method based on GAN (generative adversarial network) that\nintroduces additional textural information derived from the native HR images\nwas applied to the native LR validation images. Results show some significant\nimprovement (rRMSE=0.22) compared to bicubic up-sampling approach.",

          "description": "Monocular (relative or metric) depth estimation is a critical task for\nvarious applications, such as autonomous vehicles, augmented reality and image\nediting. In recent years, with the increasing availability of mobile devices,\naccurate and mobile-friendly depth models have gained importance. Increasingly\naccurate models typically require more computational resources, which inhibits\nthe use of such models on mobile devices. The mobile use case is arguably the\nmost unrestricted one, which requires highly accurate yet mobile-friendly\narchitectures. Therefore, we try to answer the following question: How can we\nimprove a model without adding further complexity (i.e. parameters)? Towards\nthis end, we systematically explore the design space of a relative depth\nestimation model from various dimensions and we show, with key design choices\nand ablation studies, even an existing architecture can reach highly\ncompetitive performance to the state of the art, with a fraction of the\ncomplexity. Our study spans an in-depth backbone model selection process,\nknowledge distillation, intermediate predictions, model pruning and loss\nrebalancing. We show that our model, using only DIW as the supervisory dataset,\nachieves 0.1156 WHDR on DIW with 2.6M parameters and reaches 37 FPS on a mobile\nGPU, without pruning or hardware-specific optimization.

          "description": "Accurate layout estimation is crucial for planning and navigation in robotics\napplications, such as self-driving. In this paper, we introduce the Stereo\nBird's Eye ViewNetwork (SBEVNet), a novel supervised end-to-end framework for\nestimation of bird's eye view layout from a pair of stereo images. Although our\nnetwork reuses some of the building blocks from the state-of-the-art deep\nlearning networks for disparity estimation, we show that explicit depth\nestimation is neither sufficient nor necessary. Instead, the learning of a good\ninternal bird's eye view feature representation is effective for layout\nestimation. Specifically, we first generate a disparity feature volume using\nthe features of the stereo images and then project it to the bird's eye view\ncoordinates. This gives us coarse-grained information about the scene\nstructure. We also apply inverse perspective mapping (IPM) to map the input\nimages and their features to the bird's eye view. This gives us fine-grained\ntexture information. Concatenating IPM features with the projected feature\nvolume creates a rich bird's eye view representation which is useful for\nspatial reasoning. We use this representation to estimate the BEV semantic map.\nAdditionally, we show that using the IPM features as a supervisory signal for\nstereo features can give an improvement in performance. We demonstrate our\napproach on two datasets:the KITTI dataset and a synthetically generated\ndataset from the CARLA simulator. For both of these datasets, we establish\nstate-of-the-art performance compared to baseline techniques.",

          "description": "Detecting human-object interactions (HOI) is an important step toward a\ncomprehensive visual understanding of machines. While detecting non-temporal\nHOIs (e.g., sitting on a chair) from static images is feasible, it is unlikely\neven for humans to guess temporal-related HOIs (e.g., opening/closing a door)\nfrom a single video frame, where the neighboring frames play an essential role.\nHowever, conventional HOI methods operating on only static images have been\nused to predict temporal-related interactions, which is essentially guessing\nwithout temporal contexts and may lead to sub-optimal performance. In this\npaper, we bridge this gap by detecting video-based HOIs with explicit temporal\ninformation. We first show that a naive temporal-aware variant of a common\naction detection baseline does not work on video-based HOIs due to a\nfeature-inconsistency issue. We then propose a simple yet effective\narchitecture named Spatial-Temporal HOI Detection (ST-HOI) utilizing temporal\ninformation such as human and object trajectories, correctly-localized visual\nfeatures, and spatial-temporal masking pose features. We construct a new video\nHOI benchmark dubbed VidHOI where our proposed approach serves as a solid\nbaseline.",

          "description": "Cluster discrimination is an effective pretext task for unsupervised\nrepresentation learning, which often consists of two phases: clustering and\ndiscrimination. Clustering is to assign each instance a pseudo label that will\nbe used to learn representations in discrimination. The main challenge resides\nin clustering since many prevalent clustering methods (e.g., k-means) have to\nrun in a batch mode that goes multiple iterations over the whole data.\nRecently, a balanced online clustering method, i.e., SwAV, is proposed for\nrepresentation learning. However, the assignment is optimized within only a\nsmall subset of data, which can be suboptimal. To address these challenges, we\nfirst investigate the objective of clustering-based representation learning\nfrom the perspective of distance metric learning. Based on this, we propose a\nnovel clustering-based pretext task with online \\textbf{Co}nstrained\n\\textbf{K}-m\\textbf{e}ans (\\textbf{CoKe}) to learn representations and\nrelations between instances simultaneously. Compared with the balanced\nclustering that each cluster has exactly the same size, we only constrain the\nminimum size of clusters to flexibly capture the inherent data structure. More\nimportantly, our online assignment method has a theoretical guarantee to\napproach the global optimum. Finally, two variance reduction strategies are\nproposed to make the clustering robust for different augmentations. Without\nkeeping representations of instances, the data is accessed in an online mode in\nCoKe while a single view of instances at each iteration is sufficient to\ndemonstrate a better performance than contrastive learning methods relying on\ntwo views. Extensive experiments on ImageNet verify the efficacy of our\nproposal. Code will be released.",

          "description": "Zero-shot action recognition can recognize samples of unseen classes that are\nunavailable in training by exploring common latent semantic representation in\nsamples. However, most methods neglected the connotative relation and\nextensional relation between the action classes, which leads to the poor\ngeneralization ability of the zero-shot learning. Furthermore, the learned\nclassifier incline to predict the samples of seen class, which leads to poor\nclassification performance. To solve the above problems, we propose a two-stage\ndeep neural network for zero-shot action recognition, which consists of a\nfeature generation sub-network serving as the sampling stage and a graph\nattention sub-network serving as the classification stage. In the sampling\nstage, we utilize a generative adversarial networks (GAN) trained by action\nfeatures and word vectors of seen classes to synthesize the action features of\nunseen classes, which can balance the training sample data of seen classes and\nunseen classes. In the classification stage, we construct a knowledge graph\n(KG) based on the relationship between word vectors of action classes and\nrelated objects, and propose a graph convolution network (GCN) based on\nattention mechanism, which dynamically updates the relationship between action\nclasses and objects, and enhances the generalization ability of zero-shot\nlearning. In both stages, we all use word vectors as bridges for feature\ngeneration and classifier generalization from seen classes to unseen classes.\nWe compare our method with state-of-the-art methods on UCF101 and HMDB51\ndatasets.

The\nmost efficient way to train deep SNNs is through ANN-SNN conversion. However,\nthe conversion usually suffers from accuracy loss and long inference time,\nwhich impede the practical application of SNN. In this paper, we theoretically\nanalyze ANN-SNN conversion and derive sufficient conditions of the optimal\nconversion. To better correlate ANN-SNN and get greater accuracy, we propose\nRate Norm Layer to replace the ReLU activation function in source ANN training,\nenabling direct conversion from a trained ANN to an SNN. Moreover, we propose\nan optimal fit curve to quantify the fit between the activation value of source\nANN and the actual firing rate of target SNN. We show that the inference time\ncan be reduced by optimizing the upper bound of the fit curve in the revised\nANN to achieve fast inference. Our theory can explain the existing work on fast\nreasoning and get better results. The experimental results show that the\nproposed method achieves near loss less conversion with VGG-16,\nPreActResNet-18, and deeper structures.

          "description": "We propose a novel method for fine-grained high-quality image segmentation of\nboth objects and scenes. Inspired by dilation and erosion from morphological\nimage processing techniques, we treat the pixel level segmentation problems as\nsqueezing object boundary. From this perspective, we propose \\textbf{Boundary\nSqueeze} module: a novel and efficient module that squeezes the object boundary\nfrom both inner and outer directions which leads to precise mask\nrepresentation. To generate such squeezed representation, we propose a new\nbidirectionally flow-based warping process and design specific loss signals to\nsupervise the learning process. Boundary Squeeze Module can be easily applied\nto both instance and semantic segmentation tasks as a plug-and-play module by\nbuilding on top of existing models. We show that our simple yet effective\ndesign can lead to high qualitative results on several different datasets and\nwe also provide several different metrics on boundary to prove the\neffectiveness over previous work. Moreover, the proposed module is\nlight-weighted and thus has potential for practical usage. Our method yields\nlarge gains on COCO, Cityscapes, for both instance and semantic segmentation\nand outperforms previous state-of-the-art PointRend in both accuracy and speed\nunder the same setting. Code and model will be available.",

          "description": "Stroke order and velocity are helpful features in the fields of signature\nverification, handwriting recognition, and handwriting synthesis. Recovering\nthese features from offline handwritten text is a challenging and well-studied\nproblem. We propose a new model called TRACE (Trajectory Recovery by an\nAdaptively-trained Convolutional Encoder). TRACE is a differentiable approach\nthat uses a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) to infer temporal\nstroke information from long lines of offline handwritten text with many\ncharacters and dynamic time warping (DTW) to align predictions and ground truth\npoints. TRACE is perhaps the first system to be trained end-to-end on entire\nlines of text of arbitrary width and does not require the use of dynamic\nexemplars. Moreover, the system does not require images to undergo any\npre-processing, nor do the predictions require any post-processing.\nConsequently, the recovered trajectory is differentiable and can be used as a\nloss function for other tasks, including synthesizing offline handwritten text.\n\nWe demonstrate that temporal stroke information recovered by TRACE from\noffline data can be used for handwriting synthesis and establish the first\nbenchmarks for a stroke trajectory recovery system trained on the IAM online\nhandwriting dataset.",

          "description": "The Graph Neural Network (GNN) has achieved remarkable success in graph data\nrepresentation. However, the previous work only considered the ideal balanced\ndataset, and the practical imbalanced dataset was rarely considered, which, on\nthe contrary, is of more significance for the application of GNN. Traditional\nmethods such as resampling, reweighting and synthetic samples that deal with\nimbalanced datasets are no longer applicable in GNN. Ensemble models can handle\nimbalanced datasets better compared with single estimator. Besides, ensemble\nlearning can achieve higher estimation accuracy and has better reliability\ncompared with the single estimator. In this paper, we propose an ensemble model\ncalled AdaGCN, which uses a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) as the base\nestimator during adaptive boosting. In AdaGCN, a higher weight will be set for\nthe training samples that are not properly classified by the previous\nclassifier, and transfer learning is used to reduce computational cost and\nincrease fitting capability. Experiments show that the AdaGCN model we proposed\nachieves better performance than GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, N-GCN and the most of\nadvanced reweighting and resampling methods on synthetic imbalanced datasets,\nwith an average improvement of 4.3%.

          "description": "In this paper, we propose a method for coarse camera pose computation which\nis robust to viewing conditions and does not require a detailed model of the\nscene. This method meets the growing need of easy deployment of robotics or\naugmented reality applications in any environments, especially those for which\nno accurate 3D model nor huge amount of ground truth data are available. It\nexploits the ability of deep learning techniques to reliably detect objects\nregardless of viewing conditions. Previous works have also shown that\nabstracting the geometry of a scene of objects by an ellipsoid cloud allows to\ncompute the camera pose accurately enough for various application needs. Though\npromising, these approaches use the ellipses fitted to the detection bounding\nboxes as an approximation of the imaged objects. In this paper, we go one step\nfurther and propose a learning-based method which detects improved elliptic\napproximations of objects which are coherent with the 3D ellipsoid in terms of\nperspective projection. Experiments prove that the accuracy of the computed\npose significantly increases thanks to our method and is more robust to the\nvariability of the boundaries of the detection boxes.

Previous baseline Oracle model\nencodes no visual information in the model, and it cannot fully understand\ncomplex questions about color, shape, relationships and so on. Most existing\nwork for Guesser encode the dialog history as a whole and train the Guesser\nmodels from scratch on the GuessWhat?! dataset.

Previous work for\nQuestioner introduces state tracking mechanism into the model, but it is\nlearned as a soft intermediates without any prior vision-linguistic insights.\nTo bridge these gaps, in this paper we propose Vilbert-based Oracle, Guesser\nand Questioner, which are all built on top of pretrained vision-linguistic\nmodel, Vilbert. We introduce two-way background/target fusion mechanism into\nVilbert-Oracle to account for both intra and inter-object questions.

          "description": "There is increasing evidence on the importance of brain morphology in\npredicting and classifying mental disorders. However, the vast majority of\ncurrent shape approaches rely heavily on vertex-wise analysis that may not\nsuccessfully capture complexities of subcortical structures. Additionally, the\npast works do not include interactions between these structures and exposure\nfactors. Predictive modeling with such interactions is of paramount interest in\nheterogeneous mental disorders such as PTSD, where trauma exposure interacts\nwith brain shape changes to influence behavior. We propose a comprehensive\nframework that overcomes these limitations by representing brain substructures\nas continuous parameterized surfaces and quantifying their shape differences\nusing elastic shape metrics. Using the elastic shape metric, we compute shape\nsummaries of subcortical data and represent individual shapes by their\nprincipal scores. These representations allow visualization tools that help\nlocalize changes when these PCs are varied. Subsequently, these PCs, the\nauxiliary exposure variables, and their interactions are used for regression\nmodeling. We apply our method to data from the Grady Trauma Project, where the\ngoal is to predict clinical measures of PTSD using shapes of brain\nsubstructures. Our analysis revealed considerably greater predictive power\nunder the elastic shape analysis than widely used approaches such as\nvertex-wise shape analysis and even volumetric analysis. It helped identify\nlocal deformations in brain shapes related to change in PTSD severity. To our\nknowledge, this is one of the first brain shape analysis approaches that can\nseamlessly integrate the pre-processing steps under one umbrella for improved\naccuracy and are naturally able to account for interactions between brain shape\nand additional covariates to yield superior predictive performance when\nmodeling clinical outcomes.",

          "description": "Hyperspectral images (HSIs) have been widely used in a variety of\napplications thanks to the rich spectral information they are able to provide.\nAmong all HSI processing tasks, HSI denoising is a crucial step. Recently, deep\nlearning-based image denoising methods have made great progress and achieved\ngreat performance. However, existing methods tend to ignore the correlations\nbetween adjacent spectral bands, leading to problems such as spectral\ndistortion and blurred edges in denoised results. In this study, we propose a\nnovel HSI denoising network, termed SSCAN, that combines group convolutions and\nattention modules. Specifically, we use a group convolution with a spatial\nattention module to facilitate feature extraction by directing models'\nattention to band-wise important features. We propose a spectral-spatial\nattention block (SSAB) to exploit the spatial and spectral information in\nhyperspectral images in an effective manner. In addition, we adopt residual\nlearning operations with skip connections to ensure training stability. The\nexperimental results indicate that the proposed SSCAN outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art HSI denoising algorithms.",

          "description": "Tuberculosis is a contagious disease which is one of the leading causes of\ndeath, globally. The general diagnosis methods for tuberculosis include\nmicroscopic examination, tuberculin skin test, culture method, enzyme linked\nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) and electronic nose system. World Health\nOrganization (WHO) recommends standard microscopic examination for early\ndiagnosis of tuberculosis. In microscopy, the technician examines field of\nviews (FOVs) in sputum smear for presence of any TB bacilli and counts the\nnumber of TB bacilli per FOV to report the level of severity. This process is\ntime consuming with an increased concentration for an experienced staff to\nexamine a single sputum smear. The examination demands for skilled technicians\nin high-prevalence countries which may lead to overload, fatigue and diminishes\nthe quality of microscopy. Thus, a computer assisted system is proposed and\ndesigned for the detection of tuberculosis bacilli to assist pathologists with\nincreased sensitivity and specificity. The manual efforts in detecting and\ncounting the number of TB bacilli is greatly minimized. The system obtains\nZiehl-Neelsen stained microscopic images from conventional microscope at 100x\nmagnification and passes the data to the detection system. Initially the\nsegmentation of TB bacilli was done using RGB thresholding and Sauvola's\nadaptive thresholding algorithm. To eliminate the non-TB bacilli from coarse\nlevel segmentation, shape descriptors like area, perimeter, convex hull, major\naxis length and eccentricity are used to extract only the TB bacilli features.\nFinally, the TB bacilli are counted using the generated bounding boxes to\nreport the level of severity.",

          "description": "A number of industrial applications, such as smart grids, power plant\noperation, hybrid system management or energy trading, could benefit from\nimproved short-term solar forecasting, addressing the intermittent energy\nproduction from solar panels. However, current approaches to modelling the\ncloud cover dynamics from sky images still lack precision regarding the spatial\nconfiguration of clouds, their temporal dynamics and physical interactions with\nsolar radiation. Benefiting from a growing number of large datasets, data\ndriven methods are being developed to address these limitations with promising\nresults. In this study, we compare four commonly used Deep Learning\narchitectures trained to forecast solar irradiance from sequences of\nhemispherical sky images and exogenous variables. To assess the relative\nperformance of each model, we used the Forecast Skill metric based on the smart\npersistence model, as well as ramp and time distortion metrics. The results\nshow that encoding spatiotemporal aspects of the sequence of sky images greatly\nimproved the predictions with 10 min ahead Forecast Skill reaching 20.4% on the\ntest year. However, based on the experimental data, we conclude that, with a\ncommon setup, Deep Learning models tend to behave just as a 'very smart\npersistence model', temporally aligned with the persistence model while\nmitigating its most penalising errors. Thus, despite being captured by the sky\ncameras, models often miss fundamental events causing large irradiance changes\nsuch as clouds obscuring the sun. We hope that our work will contribute to a\nshift of this approach to irradiance forecasting, from reactive to\nanticipatory.",

          "description": "Quantization is a technique used in deep neural networks (DNNs) to increase\nexecution performance and hardware efficiency. Uniform post-training\nquantization (PTQ) methods are common, since they can be implemented\nefficiently in hardware and do not require extensive hardware resources or a\ntraining set. Mapping FP32 models to INT8 using uniform PTQ yields models with\nnegligible accuracy degradation; however, reducing precision below 8 bits with\nPTQ is challenging, as accuracy degradation becomes noticeable, due to the\nincrease in quantization noise. In this paper, we propose a sparsity-aware\nquantization (SPARQ) method, in which the unstructured and dynamic activation\nsparsity is leveraged in different representation granularities. 4-bit\nquantization, for example, is employed by dynamically examining the bits of\n8-bit values and choosing a window of 4 bits, while first skipping zero-value\nbits. Moreover, instead of quantizing activation-by-activation to 4 bits, we\nfocus on pairs of 8-bit activations and examine whether one of the two is equal\nto zero. If one is equal to zero, the second can opportunistically use the\nother's 4-bit budget; if both do not equal zero, then each is dynamically\nquantized to 4 bits, as described. SPARQ achieves minor accuracy degradation,\n2x speedup over widely used hardware architectures, and a practical hardware\nimplementation. The code is available at https://github.com/gilshm/sparq.",

          "description": "The COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) has infected more than 151 million\npeople and caused approximately 3.17 million deaths around the world up to the\npresent. The rapid spread of COVID-19 is continuing to threaten human's life\nand health. Therefore, the development of computer-aided detection (CAD)\nsystems based on machine and deep learning methods which are able to accurately\ndifferentiate COVID-19 from other diseases using chest computed tomography (CT)\nand X-Ray datasets is essential and of immediate priority. Different from most\nof the previous studies which used either one of CT or X-ray images, we\nemployed both data types with sufficient samples in implementation. On the\nother hand, due to the extreme sensitivity of this pervasive virus, model\nuncertainty should be considered, while most previous studies have overlooked\nit. Therefore, we propose a novel powerful fusion model named\n$UncertaintyFuseNet$ that consists of an uncertainty module: Ensemble Monte\nCarlo (EMC) dropout. The obtained results prove the effectiveness of our\nproposed fusion for COVID-19 detection using CT scan and X-Ray datasets. Also,\nour proposed $UncertaintyFuseNet$ model is significantly robust to noise and\nperforms well with the previously unseen data. The source codes and models of\nthis study are available at:\nhttps://github.com/moloud1987/UncertaintyFuseNet-for-COVID-19-Classification.",

          "description": "With the increase in the learning capability of deep convolution-based\narchitectures, various applications of such models have been proposed over\ntime. In the field of anomaly detection, improvements in deep learning opened\nnew prospects of exploration for the researchers whom tried to automate the\nlabor-intensive features of data collection. First, in terms of data\ncollection, it is impossible to anticipate all the anomalies that might exist\nin a given environment. Second, assuming we limit the possibilities of\nanomalies, it will still be hard to record all these scenarios for the sake of\ntraining a model. Third, even if we manage to record a significant amount of\nabnormal data, it's laborious to annotate this data on pixel or even frame\nlevel. Various approaches address the problem by proposing one-class\nclassification using generative models trained on only normal data. In such\nmethods, only the normal data is used, which is abundantly available and\ndoesn't require significant human input. However, these are trained with only\nnormal data and at the test time, given abnormal data as input, may often\ngenerate normal-looking output. This happens due to the hallucination\ncharacteristic of generative models. Next, these systems are designed to not\nuse abnormal examples during the training. In this paper, we propose anomaly\ndetection with negative learning (ADNL), which employs the negative learning\nconcept for the enhancement of anomaly detection by utilizing a very small\nnumber of labeled anomaly data as compared with the normal data during\ntraining. The idea is to limit the reconstruction capability of a generative\nmodel using the given a small amount of anomaly examples. This way, the network\nnot only learns to reconstruct normal data but also encloses the normal\ndistribution far from the possible distribution of anomalies.",

          "description": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are widely used in graph-based\napplications such as graph classification and segmentation. However, current\nGCNs have limitations on implementation such as network architectures due to\ntheir irregular inputs. In contrast, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are\ncapable of extracting rich features from large-scale input data, but they do\nnot support general graph inputs. To bridge the gap between GCNs and CNNs, in\nthis paper we study the problem of how to effectively and efficiently map\ngeneral graphs to 2D grids that CNNs can be directly applied to, while\npreserving graph topology as much as possible. We therefore propose two novel\ngraph-to-grid mapping schemes, namely, {\\em graph-preserving grid layout\n(GPGL)} and its extension {\\em Hierarchical GPGL (H-GPGL)} for computational\nefficiency. We formulate the GPGL problem as integer programming and further\npropose an approximate yet efficient solver based on a penalized Kamada-Kawai\nmethod, a well-known optimization algorithm in 2D graph drawing. We propose a\nnovel vertex separation penalty that encourages graph vertices to lay on the\ngrid without any overlap. Along with this image representation, even extra 2D\nmaxpooling layers contribute to the PointNet, a widely applied point-based\nneural network. We demonstrate the empirical success of GPGL on general graph\nclassification with small graphs and H-GPGL on 3D point cloud segmentation with\nlarge graphs, based on 2D CNNs including VGG16, ResNet50 and multi-scale maxout\n(MSM) CNN.",

          "description": "Noisy neural networks (NoisyNNs) refer to the inference and training of NNs\nin the presence of noise. Noise is inherent in most communication and storage\nsystems; hence, NoisyNNs emerge in many new applications, including federated\nedge learning, where wireless devices collaboratively train a NN over a noisy\nwireless channel, or when NNs are implemented/stored in an analog storage\nmedium. This paper studies a fundamental problem of NoisyNNs: how to estimate\nthe uncontaminated NN weights from their noisy observations or manifestations.\nWhereas all prior works relied on the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation to\nmaximize the likelihood function of the estimated NN weights, this paper\ndemonstrates that the ML estimator is in general suboptimal. To overcome the\nsuboptimality of the conventional ML estimator, we put forth an\n$\\text{MMSE}_{pb}$ estimator to minimize a compensated mean squared error (MSE)\nwith a population compensator and a bias compensator. Our approach works well\nfor NoisyNNs arising in both 1) noisy inference, where noise is introduced only\nin the inference phase on the already-trained NN weights; and 2) noisy\ntraining, where noise is introduced over the course of training. Extensive\nexperiments on the CIFAR-10 and SST-2 datasets with different NN architectures\nverify the significant performance gains of the $\\text{MMSE}_{pb}$ estimator\nover the ML estimator when used to denoise the NoisyNN. For noisy inference,\nthe average gains are up to $156\\%$ for a noisy ResNet34 model and $14.7\\%$ for\na noisy BERT model; for noisy training, the average gains are up to $18.1$ dB\nfor a noisy ResNet18 model.",

          "description": "Numerical integration is a foundational technique in scientific computing and\nis at the core of many computer vision applications. Among these applications,\nneural volume rendering has recently been proposed as a new paradigm for view\nsynthesis, achieving photorealistic image quality. However, a fundamental\nobstacle to making these methods practical is the extreme computational and\nmemory requirements caused by the required volume integrations along the\nrendered rays during training and inference. Millions of rays, each requiring\nhundreds of forward passes through a neural network are needed to approximate\nthose integrations with Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we propose automatic\nintegration, a new framework for learning efficient, closed-form solutions to\nintegrals using coordinate-based neural networks. For training, we instantiate\nthe computational graph corresponding to the derivative of the network. The\ngraph is fitted to the signal to integrate. After optimization, we reassemble\nthe graph to obtain a network that represents the antiderivative. By the\nfundamental theorem of calculus, this enables the calculation of any definite\nintegral in two evaluations of the network.

Moreover, we observe that\nfor-profit goals drive task instructions and that managers and algorithms make\nsure annotations are done according to requesters' commands. This configuration\npresents a form of commodified labor that perpetuates power asymmetries while\nreinforcing social inequalities and is compelled to reproduce them into\ndatasets and, subsequently, in computer vision systems.",

To this\nend, we present a challenging new task called gaze object prediction, where the\ngoal is to predict a bounding box for a person's gazed-at object. To train and\nevaluate gaze networks on this task, we present the Gaze On Objects (GOO)\ndataset. GOO is composed of a large set of synthetic images (GOO Synth)\nsupplemented by a smaller subset of real images (GOO-Real) of people looking at\nobjects in a retail environment.

          "description": "Despite the astonishing performance of deep-learning based approaches for\nvisual tasks such as semantic segmentation, they are known to produce\nmiscalibrated predictions, which could be harmful for critical decision-making\nprocesses. Ensemble learning has shown to not only boost the performance of\nindividual models but also reduce their miscalibration by averaging independent\npredictions. In this scenario, model diversity has become a key factor, which\nfacilitates individual models converging to different functional solutions. In\nthis work, we introduce Orthogonal Ensemble Networks (OEN), a novel framework\nto explicitly enforce model diversity by means of orthogonal constraints. The\nproposed method is based on the hypothesis that inducing orthogonality among\nthe constituents of the ensemble will increase the overall model diversity. We\nresort to a new pairwise orthogonality constraint which can be used to\nregularize a sequential ensemble training process, resulting on improved\npredictive performance and better calibrated model outputs. We benchmark the\nproposed framework in two challenging brain lesion segmentation tasks --brain\ntumor and white matter hyper-intensity segmentation in MR images. The\nexperimental results show that our approach produces more robust and\nwell-calibrated ensemble models and can deal with challenging tasks in the\ncontext of biomedical image segmentation.",

          "description": "Neural networks trained on real-world datasets with long-tailed label\ndistributions are biased towards frequent classes and perform poorly on\ninfrequent classes. The imbalance in the ratio of positive and negative samples\nfor each class skews network output probabilities further from ground-truth\ndistributions. We propose a method, Partial Label Masking (PLM), which utilizes\nthis ratio during training. By stochastically masking labels during loss\ncomputation, the method balances this ratio for each class, leading to improved\nrecall on minority classes and improved precision on frequent classes. The\nratio is estimated adaptively based on the network's performance by minimizing\nthe KL divergence between predicted and ground-truth distributions. Whereas\nmost existing approaches addressing data imbalance are mainly focused on\nsingle-label classification and do not generalize well to the multi-label case,\nthis work proposes a general approach to solve the long-tail data imbalance\nissue for multi-label classification. PLM is versatile: it can be applied to\nmost objective functions and it can be used alongside other strategies for\nclass imbalance. Our method achieves strong performance when compared to\nexisting methods on both multi-label (MultiMNIST and MSCOCO) and single-label\n(imbalanced CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) image classification datasets.",

Predicting target classes with a few\nsupport examples per class makes the learning task difficult for existing\nsemi-supervised classification methods, including selftraining, which\niteratively estimates class labels of unlabeled training examples to learn a\nclassifier for the training classes.

Moreover,\ninstead of merely concatenating the descriptors, HPNet optimally combines\nhybrid representations by learning combination weights.

          "description": "This paper develops a method of biologically guided deep learning for\npost-radiation FDG-PET image outcome prediction based on pre-radiation images\nand radiotherapy dose information. Based on the classic reaction-diffusion\nmechanism, a novel biological model was proposed using a partial differential\nequation that incorporates spatial radiation dose distribution as a\npatient-specific treatment information variable. A 7-layer\nencoder-decoder-based convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed and\ntrained to learn the proposed biological model. As such, the model could\ngenerate post-radiation FDG-PET image outcome predictions with possible\ntime-series transition from pre-radiotherapy image states to post-radiotherapy\nstates. The proposed method was developed using 64 oropharyngeal patients with\npaired FDG-PET studies before and after 20Gy delivery (2Gy/daily fraction) by\nIMRT. In a two-branch deep learning execution, the proposed CNN learns specific\nterms in the biological model from paired FDG-PET images and spatial dose\ndistribution as in one branch, and the biological model generates post-20Gy\nFDG-PET image prediction in the other branch. The proposed method successfully\ngenerated post-20Gy FDG-PET image outcome prediction with breakdown\nillustrations of biological model components. Time-series FDG-PET image\npredictions were generated to demonstrate the feasibility of disease response\nrendering. The developed biologically guided deep learning method achieved\npost-20Gy FDG-PET image outcome predictions in good agreement with ground-truth\nresults. With break-down biological modeling components, the outcome image\npredictions could be used in adaptive radiotherapy decision-making to optimize\npersonalized plans for the best outcome in the future.",

To address this issue, we\npresent a simple re-Detect and Link (DL) module which can effectively reduce\nthose unexpected noise through applying the deep learning-based detection and\ntracking on the cropped tracklets.

          "description": "Significant progress on the crowd counting problem has been achieved by\nintegrating larger context into convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This\nindicates that global scene context is essential, despite the seemingly\nbottom-up nature of the problem. This may be explained by the fact that context\nknowledge can adapt and improve local feature extraction to a given scene. In\nthis paper, we therefore investigate the role of global context for crowd\ncounting. Specifically, a pure transformer is used to extract features with\nglobal information from overlapping image patches. Inspired by classification,\nwe add a context token to the input sequence, to facilitate information\nexchange with tokens corresponding to image patches throughout transformer\nlayers. Due to the fact that transformers do not explicitly model the\ntried-and-true channel-wise interactions, we propose a token-attention module\n(TAM) to recalibrate encoded features through channel-wise attention informed\nby the context token. Beyond that, it is adopted to predict the total person\ncount of the image through regression-token module (RTM). Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various\ndatasets, including ShanghaiTech, UCF-QNRF, JHU-CROWD++ and NWPU.

Specifically, our method contains two steps: triangulation\nand refinement. First, given the 2D keypoints that can be obtained through any\nclassic 2D detection methods, triangulation is performed across two views to\nlift the 2D keypoints into coarse 3D poses.Then, a novel cross-view U-shaped\ngraph convolutional network (CV-UGCN), which can explore the spatial\nconfigurations and cross-view correlations, is designed to refine the coarse 3D\nposes. In particular, the refinement progress is achieved through\nweakly-supervised learning, in which geometric and structure-aware consistency\nchecks are performed. We evaluate our method on the standard benchmark dataset,\nHuman3.6M.

In this context, we\npropose a deep learning framework, trained in an end-to-end fashion from\nelevation maps and trajectories, to estimate the occurrence of failure events.\nThe network is first trained and tested in simulation over synthetic maps\ngenerated by the OpenSimplex algorithm. The prediction performance of the Deep\nLearning framework is illustrated by being able to retain over 94% recall of\nthe original simulator at 30% of the computational time. Finally, the network\nis transferred and tested on real elevation maps collected by the SEEKER\nconsortium during the Martian rover test trial in the Atacama desert in Chile.\nWe show that transferring and fine-tuning of an application-independent\npre-trained model retains better performance than training uniquely on scarcely\navailable real data.",

          "description": "Recently, DETR and Deformable DETR have been proposed to eliminate the need\nfor many hand-designed components in object detection while demonstrating good\nperformance as previous complex hand-crafted detectors. However, their\nperformance on Video Object Detection (VOD) has not been well explored. In this\npaper, we present TransVOD, an end-to-end video object detection model based on\na spatial-temporal Transformer architecture. The goal of this paper is to\nstreamline the pipeline of VOD, effectively removing the need for many\nhand-crafted components for feature aggregation, e.g., optical flow, recurrent\nneural networks, relation networks. Besides, benefited from the object query\ndesign in DETR, our method does not need complicated post-processing methods\nsuch as Seq-NMS or Tubelet rescoring, which keeps the pipeline simple and\nclean. In particular, we present temporal Transformer to aggregate both the\nspatial object queries and the feature memories of each frame. Our temporal\nTransformer consists of three components: Temporal Deformable Transformer\nEncoder (TDTE) to encode the multiple frame spatial details, Temporal Query\nEncoder (TQE) to fuse object queries, and Temporal Deformable Transformer\nDecoder to obtain current frame detection results. These designs boost the\nstrong baseline deformable DETR by a significant margin (3%-4% mAP) on the\nImageNet VID dataset. TransVOD yields comparable results performance on the\nbenchmark of ImageNet VID. We hope our TransVOD can provide a new perspective\nfor video object detection.

To\ntackle this problem, we propose a new deep learning-based framework that\nconsists of two main modules.

The second\nmodule regresses the 2D joint locations through a multi-scale heatmap\nregression approach that exploits the predicted hand skeleton as a constraint\nto guide the model. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset that is suitable\nfor both hand detection and pose estimation. We qualitatively and\nquantitatively validate our method on two datasets.

          "description": "Recently, satellites with high temporal resolution have fostered wide\nattention in various practical applications. Due to limitations of bandwidth\nand hardware cost, however, the spatial resolution of such satellites is\nconsiderably low, largely limiting their potentials in scenarios that require\nspatially explicit information. To improve image resolution, numerous\napproaches based on training low-high resolution pairs have been proposed to\naddress the super-resolution (SR) task. Despite their success, however,\nlow/high spatial resolution pairs are usually difficult to obtain in satellites\nwith a high temporal resolution, making such approaches in SR impractical to\nuse. In this paper, we proposed a new unsupervised learning framework, called\n\"MIP\", which achieves SR tasks without low/high resolution image pairs. First,\nrandom noise maps are fed into a designed generative adversarial network (GAN)\nfor reconstruction. Then, the proposed method converts the reference image to\nlatent space as the migration image prior. Finally, we update the input noise\nvia an implicit method, and further transfer the texture and structured\ninformation from the reference image. Extensive experimental results on the\nDraper dataset show that MIP achieves significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

We find that this adjustment can be\nachieved by shrinking widened baseline networks and leads to superior\nperformance. Based on that, we articulate the heterogeneity hypothesis: with\nthe same training protocol, there exists a layer-wise differentiated network\narchitecture (LW-DNA) that can outperform the original network with regular\nchannel configurations but with a lower level of model complexity.\n\nThe LW-DNA models are identified without extra computational cost or training\ntime compared with the original network. This constraint leads to controlled\nexperiments which direct the focus to the importance of layer-wise specific\nchannel configurations. LW-DNA models come with advantages related to\noverfitting, i.e. the relative relationship between model complexity and\ndataset size.

          "description": "D shape generation is a fundamental operation in computer graphics. While\nsignificant progress has been made, especially with recent deep generative\nmodels, it remains a challenge to synthesize high-quality shapes with rich\ngeometric details and complex structure, in a controllable manner. To tackle\nthis, we introduce DSG-Net, a deep neural network that learns a disentangled\nstructured and geometric mesh representation for 3D shapes, where two key\naspects of shapes, geometry, and structure, are encoded in a synergistic manner\nto ensure plausibility of the generated shapes, while also being disentangled\nas much as possible. This supports a range of novel shape generation\napplications with disentangled control, such as interpolation of structure\n(geometry) while keeping geometry (structure) unchanged. To achieve this, we\nsimultaneously learn structure and geometry through variational autoencoders\n(VAEs) in a hierarchical manner for both, with bijective mappings at each\nlevel. In this manner, we effectively encode geometry and structure in separate\nlatent spaces, while ensuring their compatibility: the structure is used to\nguide the geometry and vice versa. At the leaf level, the part geometry is\nrepresented using a conditional part VAE, to encode high-quality geometric\ndetails, guided by the structure context as the condition. Our method not only\nsupports controllable generation applications but also produces high-quality\nsynthesized shapes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

          "description": "We present a methodology to automatically obtain Pose Space Deformation (PSD)\nbasis for rigged garments through deep learning. Classical approaches rely on\nPhysically Based Simulations (PBS) to animate clothes. These are general\nsolutions that, given a sufficiently fine-grained discretization of space and\ntime, can achieve highly realistic results. However, they are computationally\nexpensive and any scene modification prompts the need of re-simulation. Linear\nBlend Skinning (LBS) with PSD offers a lightweight alternative to PBS, though,\nit needs huge volumes of data to learn proper PSD. We propose using deep\nlearning, formulated as an implicit PBS, to unsupervisedly learn realistic\ncloth Pose Space Deformations in a constrained scenario: dressed humans.\nFurthermore, we show it is possible to train these models in an amount of time\ncomparable to a PBS of a few sequences. To the best of our knowledge, we are\nthe first to propose a neural simulator for cloth. While deep-based approaches\nin the domain are becoming a trend, these are data-hungry models. Moreover,\nauthors often propose complex formulations to better learn wrinkles from PBS\ndata. Supervised learning leads to physically inconsistent predictions that\nrequire collision solving to be used. Also, dependency on PBS data limits the\nscalability of these solutions, while their formulation hinders its\napplicability and compatibility. By proposing an unsupervised methodology to\nlearn PSD for LBS models (3D animation standard), we overcome both of these\ndrawbacks. Results obtained show cloth-consistency in the animated garments and\nmeaningful pose-dependant folds and wrinkles. Our solution is extremely\nefficient, handles multiple layers of cloth, allows unsupervised outfit\nresizing and can be easily applied to any custom 3D avatar.",

          "description": "Channel pruning and tensor decomposition have received extensive attention in\nconvolutional neural network compression. However, these two techniques are\ntraditionally deployed in an isolated manner, leading to significant accuracy\ndrop when pursuing high compression rates. In this paper, we propose a\nCollaborative Compression (CC) scheme, which joints channel pruning and tensor\ndecomposition to compress CNN models by simultaneously learning the model\nsparsity and low-rankness. Specifically, we first investigate the compression\nsensitivity of each layer in the network, and then propose a Global Compression\nRate Optimization that transforms the decision problem of compression rate into\nan optimization problem. After that, we propose multi-step heuristic\ncompression to remove redundant compression units step-by-step, which fully\nconsiders the effect of the remaining compression space (i.e., unremoved\ncompression units). Our method demonstrates superior performance gains over\nprevious ones on various datasets and backbone architectures. For example, we\nachieve 52.9% FLOPs reduction by removing 48.4% parameters on ResNet-50 with\nonly a Top-1 accuracy drop of 0.56% on ImageNet 2012.",

          "description": "Recent advances on Vision Transformers (ViT) have shown that\nself-attention-based networks, which take advantage of long-range dependencies\nmodeling ability, surpassed traditional convolution neural networks (CNNs) in\nmost vision tasks. To further expand the applicability for computer vision,\nmany improved variants are proposed to re-design the Transformer architecture\nby considering the superiority of CNNs, i.e., locality, translation invariance,\nfor better performance. However, these methods only consider the standard\naccuracy or computation cost of the model. In this paper, we rethink the design\nprinciples of ViTs based on the robustness. We found some design components\ngreatly harm the robustness and generalization ability of ViTs while some\nothers are beneficial. By combining the robust design components, we propose\nRobust Vision Transformer (RVT). RVT is a new vision transformer, which has\nsuperior performance and strong robustness. We further propose two new\nplug-and-play techniques called position-aware attention rescaling and\npatch-wise augmentation to train our RVT. The experimental results on ImageNet\nand six robustness benchmarks show the advanced robustness and generalization\nability of RVT compared with previous Transformers and state-of-the-art CNNs.\nOur RVT-S* also achieves Top-1 rank on multiple robustness leaderboards\nincluding ImageNet-C and ImageNet-Sketch.

          "description": "Monocular 3D human pose estimation from a single RGB image has received a lot\nattentions in the past few year. Pose inference models with competitive\nperformance however require supervision with 3D pose ground truth data or at\nleast known pose priors in their target domain. Yet, these data requirements in\nmany real-world applications with data collection constraints may not be\nachievable. In this paper, we present a heuristic weakly supervised solution,\ncalled HW-HuP to estimate 3D human pose in contexts that no ground truth 3D\ndata is accessible, even for fine-tuning. HW-HuP learns partial pose priors\nfrom public 3D human pose datasets and uses easy-to-access observations from\nthe target domain to iteratively estimate 3D human pose and shape in an\noptimization and regression hybrid cycle. In our design, depth data as an\nauxiliary information is employed as weak supervision during training, yet it\nis not needed for the inference. We evaluate HW-HuP performance qualitatively\non datasets of both in-bed human and infant poses, where no ground truth 3D\npose is provided neither any target prior. We also test HW-HuP performance\nquantitatively on a publicly available motion capture dataset against the 3D\nground truth. HW-HuP is also able to be extended to other input modalities for\npose estimation tasks especially under adverse vision conditions, such as\nocclusion or full darkness. On the Human3.6M benchmark, HW-HuP shows 104.1mm in\nMPJPE and 50.4mm in PA MPJPE, comparable to the existing state-of-the-art\napproaches that benefit from full 3D pose supervision.",

          "description": "We show a straightforward and useful methodology for performing instance\nsegmentation using synthetic data. We apply this methodology on a basic case\nand derived insights through quantitative analysis. We created a new public\ndataset: The Expo Markers Dataset intended for detection and segmentation\ntasks. This dataset contains 5,000 synthetic photorealistic images with their\ncorresponding pixel-perfect segmentation ground truth. The goal is to achieve\nhigh performance on manually-gathered and annotated real-world data of custom\nobjects. We do that by creating 3D models of the target objects and other\npossible distraction objects and place them within a simulated environment.\nExpo Markers were chosen for this task, fitting our requirements of a custom\nobject due to the exact texture, size and 3D shape. An additional advantage is\nthe availability of this object in offices around the world for easy testing\nand validation of our results. We generate the data using a domain\nrandomization technique that also simulates other photorealistic objects in the\nscene, known as distraction objects. These objects provide visual complexity,\nocclusions, and lighting challenges to help our model gain robustness in\ntraining. We are also releasing our manually-gathered datasets used for\ncomparison and evaluation of our synthetic dataset. This white-paper provides\nstrong evidence that photorealistic simulated data can be used in practical\nreal world applications as a more scalable and flexible solution than\nmanually-captured data.

While they offer\nhigh performance in terms of accuracy, people are concerned about if these\nmodels inappropriately make inferences using irrelevant features that are not\nencoded from the target object in a given image. To address the concern, we\npropose a metamorphic testing approach that assesses if a given inference is\nmade based on irrelevant features. Specifically, we propose two novel\nmetamorphic relations to detect such inappropriate inferences. We applied our\napproach to 10 image classification models and 10 object detection models, with\nthree large datasets, i.e., ImageNet, COCO, and Pascal VOC. Over 5.3% of the\ntop-5 correct predictions made by the image classification models are subject\nto inappropriate inferences using irrelevant features. The corresponding rate\nfor the object detection models is over 8.5%. Based on the findings, we further\ndesigned a new image generation strategy that can effectively attack existing\nmodels. Comparing with a baseline approach, our strategy can double the success\nrate of attacks.",

We propose an automatic\nsegmentation method based on Stacked Hourglass Network (SHN) to detect the\nspinous processes (SP) on ultrasound (US) spine images and to measure the SPAs\nof clinical scoliotic subjects. Methods: The network was trained to detect\nvertebral SP and laminae as five landmarks on 1200 ultrasound transverse images\nand validated on 100 images. All the processed transverse images with\nhighlighted SP and laminae were reconstructed into a 3D image volume, and the\nSPAs were measured on the projected coronal images. The trained network was\ntested on 400 images by calculating the percentage of correct keypoints (PCK);\nand the SPA measurements were evaluated on 50 scoliotic subjects by comparing\nthe results from US images and radiographs. Results: The trained network\nachieved a high average PCK (86.8%) on the test datasets, particularly the PCK\nof SP detection was 90.3%. The SPAs measured from US and radiographic methods\nshowed good correlation (r>0.85), and the mean absolute differences (MAD)\nbetween two modalities were 3.3{\\deg}, which was less than the clinical\nacceptance error (5{\\deg}).

To identify the\nstate-of-art of computer vision techniques currently applied to cytology, we\nconducted a Systematic Literature Review. We analyzed papers published in the\nlast 5 years. The initial search was executed in September 2020 and resulted in\n431 articles. After applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 157 papers\nremained, which we analyzed to build a picture of the tendencies and problems\npresent in this research area, highlighting the computer vision methods,\nstaining techniques, evaluation metrics, and the availability of the used\ndatasets and computer code. As a result, we identified that the most used\nmethods in the analyzed works are deep learning-based (70 papers), while fewer\nworks employ classic computer vision only (101 papers). The most recurrent\nmetric used for classification and object detection was the accuracy (33 papers\nand 5 papers), while for segmentation it was the Dice Similarity Coefficient\n(38 papers). Regarding staining techniques, Papanicolaou was the most employed\none (130 papers), followed by H&E (20 papers) and Feulgen (5 papers). Twelve of\nthe datasets used in the papers are publicly available, with the DTU/Herlev\ndataset being the most used one.

In this paper, we present yet\nanother method to perform corner detection, dubbed look-up event-Harris\n(luvHarris), that employs the Harris algorithm for high accuracy but manages an\nimproved event throughput. Our method has two major contributions, 1. a novel\n\"threshold ordinal event-surface\" that removes certain tuning parameters and is\nwell suited for Harris operations, and 2. an implementation of the Harris\nalgorithm such that the computational load per-event is minimised and\ncomputational heavy convolutions are performed only 'as-fast-as-possible', i.e.\nonly as computational resources are available. The result is a practical,\nreal-time, and robust corner detector that runs more than $2.6\\times$ the speed\nof current state-of-the-art; a necessity when using high-resolution\nevent-camera in real-time.

For example, when the robot is told to \"bring me the\nbook in the girl's left hand\", most existing methods would fail if the girl\nholds one book respectively in her left and right hand. In this work, we\nintroduce a new task named human-centric relation segmentation (HRS), as a\nfine-grained case of HOI-det. HRS aims to predict the relations between the\nhuman and surrounding entities and identify the relation-correlated human\nparts, which are represented as pixel-level masks. For the above exemplar case,\nour HRS task produces results in the form of relation triplets <girl [left\nhand], hold, book> and exacts segmentation masks of the book, with which the\nrobot can easily accomplish the grabbing task. Correspondingly, we collect a\nnew Person In Context (PIC) dataset for this new task, which contains 17,122\nhigh-resolution images and densely annotated entity segmentation and relations,\nincluding 141 object categories, 23 relation categories and 25 semantic human\nparts.

          "description": "Learning discriminative representation using large-scale face datasets in the\nwild is crucial for real-world applications, yet it remains challenging. The\ndifficulties lie in many aspects and this work focus on computing resource\nconstraint and long-tailed class distribution. Recently, classification-based\nrepresentation learning with deep neural networks and well-designed losses have\ndemonstrated good recognition performance. However, the computing and memory\ncost linearly scales up to the number of identities (classes) in the training\nset, and the learning process suffers from unbalanced classes. In this work, we\npropose a dynamic class queue (DCQ) to tackle these two problems. Specifically,\nfor each iteration during training, a subset of classes for recognition are\ndynamically selected and their class weights are dynamically generated\non-the-fly which are stored in a queue. Since only a subset of classes is\nselected for each iteration, the computing requirement is reduced. By using a\nsingle server without model parallel, we empirically verify in large-scale\ndatasets that 10% of classes are sufficient to achieve similar performance as\nusing all classes. Moreover, the class weights are dynamically generated in a\nfew-shot manner and therefore suitable for tail classes with only a few\ninstances. We show clear improvement over a strong baseline in the largest\npublic dataset Megaface Challenge2 (MF2) which has 672K identities and over 88%\nof them have less than 10 instances.

Machine learning techniques, and deep neural networks in particular,\nare the state-of-the-art for most medical image segmentation tasks. Issues with\nclass imbalance pose a significant challenge in medical datasets, with lesions\noften occupying a considerably smaller volume relative to the background. Loss\nfunctions used in the training of deep learning algorithms differ in their\nrobustness to class imbalance, with direct consequences for model convergence.\nThe most commonly used loss functions for segmentation are based on either the\ncross entropy loss, Dice loss or a combination of the two. We propose a Unified\nFocal loss, a new framework that generalises Dice and cross entropy-based\nlosses for handling class imbalance. We evaluate our proposed loss function on\nthree highly class imbalanced, publicly available medical imaging datasets:\nBreast Ultrasound 2017 (BUS2017), Brain Tumour Segmentation 2020 (BraTS20) and\nKidney Tumour Segmentation 2019 (KiTS19). We compare our loss function\nperformance against six Dice or cross entropy-based loss functions, and\ndemonstrate that our proposed loss function is robust to class imbalance,\noutperforming the other loss functions across datasets. Finally, we use the\nUnified Focal loss together with deep supervision to achieve state-of-the-art\nresults without modification of the original U-Net architecture, with a mean\nDice similarity coefficient (DSC)=0.948 on BUS2017, enhancing tumour region\nDSC=0.800 on BraTS20 and kidney tumour DSC=0.758 on KiTS19.

We approach this problem from a weakly supervised learning perspective\nin which the input images correspond to larger neighborhoods around the\nexpected object locations where an object with a given class label is present\nin the neighborhood without any knowledge of its exact location. The proposed\nmethod uses a single-source deep instance attention model with parallel\nbranches for joint localization and classification of objects, and extends this\nmodel into a multisource setting where a reference source that is assumed to\nhave no location uncertainty is used to aid the fusion of multiple sources in\nfour different levels: probability level, logit level, feature level, and pixel\nlevel.

          "description": "Point cloud semantic segmentation is a crucial task in 3D scene\nunderstanding. Existing methods mainly focus on employing a large number of\nannotated labels for supervised semantic segmentation. Nonetheless, manually\nlabeling such large point clouds for the supervised segmentation task is\ntime-consuming. In order to reduce the number of annotated labels, we propose a\nsemi-supervised semantic point cloud segmentation network, named SSPC-Net,\nwhere we train the semantic segmentation network by inferring the labels of\nunlabeled points from the few annotated 3D points. In our method, we first\npartition the whole point cloud into superpoints and build superpoint graphs to\nmine the long-range dependencies in point clouds. Based on the constructed\nsuperpoint graph, we then develop a dynamic label propagation method to\ngenerate the pseudo labels for the unsupervised superpoints. Particularly, we\nadopt a superpoint dropout strategy to dynamically select the generated pseudo\nlabels. In order to fully exploit the generated pseudo labels of the\nunsupervised superpoints, we furthermore propose a coupled attention mechanism\nfor superpoint feature embedding. Finally, we employ the cross-entropy loss to\ntrain the semantic segmentation network with the labels of the supervised\nsuperpoints and the pseudo labels of the unsupervised superpoints. Experiments\non various datasets demonstrate that our semi-supervised segmentation method\ncan achieve better performance than the current semi-supervised segmentation\nmethod with fewer annotated 3D points.

          "description": "Purpose: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer\nmortality worldwide. Colonoscopy is a widely used technique for colon screening\nand polyp lesions diagnosis. Nevertheless, manual screening using colonoscopy\nsuffers from a substantial miss rate of polyps and is an overwhelming burden\nfor endoscopists. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for polyp detection has the\npotential to reduce human error and human burden. However, current polyp\ndetection methods based on object detection framework need many handcrafted\npre-processing and post-processing operations or user guidance that require\ndomain-specific knowledge.\n\nMethods: In this paper, we propose a convolution in transformer (COTR)\nnetwork for end-to-end polyp detection. Motivated by the detection transformer\n(DETR), COTR is constituted by a CNN for feature extraction, transformer\nencoder layers interleaved with convolutional layers for feature encoding and\nrecalibration, transformer decoder layers for object querying, and a\nfeed-forward network for detection prediction. Considering the slow convergence\nof DETR, COTR embeds convolution layers into transformer encoder for feature\nreconstruction and convergence acceleration.\n\nResults: Experimental results on two public polyp datasets show that COTR\nachieved 91.49\\% precision, 82.69% sensitivity, and 86.87% F1-score on the\nETIS-LARIB, and 91.67% precision, 93.54% sensitivity, and 92.60% F1-score on\nthe CVC-ColonDB.\n\nConclusion: This study proposed an end to end detection method based on\ndetection transformer for colorectal polyp detection. Experimental results on\nETIS-LARIB and CVC-ColonDB dataset demonstrated that the proposed model\nachieved comparable performance against state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Recently, query based object detection frameworks achieve comparable\nperformance with previous state-of-the-art object detectors. However, how to\nfully leverage such frameworks to perform instance segmentation remains an open\nproblem. In this paper, we present QueryInst (Instances as Queries), a query\nbased instance segmentation method driven by parallel supervision on dynamic\nmask heads. The key insight of QueryInst is to leverage the intrinsic\none-to-one correspondence in object queries across different stages, as well as\none-to-one correspondence between mask RoI features and object queries in the\nsame stage. This approach eliminates the explicit multi-stage mask head\nconnection and the proposal distribution inconsistency issues inherent in\nnon-query based multi-stage instance segmentation methods. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on three challenging benchmarks, i.e., COCO, CityScapes, and\nYouTube-VIS to evaluate the effectiveness of QueryInst in instance segmentation\nand video instance segmentation (VIS) task. Specifically, using ResNet-101-FPN\nbackbone, QueryInst obtains 48.1 box AP and 42.8 mask AP on COCO test-dev,\nwhich is 2 points higher than HTC in terms of both box AP and mask AP, while\nruns 2.4 times faster. For video instance segmentation, QueryInst achieves the\nbest performance among all online VIS approaches and strikes a decent\nspeed-accuracy trade-off.

Currently, deep learning-based SISR approaches\nhave been widely discussed in medical image processing, because of their\npotential to achieve high-quality, high spatial resolution images without the\ncost of additional scans. However, most existing methods are designed for\nscale-specific SR tasks and are unable to generalise over magnification scales.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach for medical image arbitrary-scale\nsuper-resolution (MIASSR), in which we couple meta-learning with generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) to super-resolve medical images at any scale of\nmagnification in (1, 4]. Compared to state-of-the-art SISR algorithms on\nsingle-modal magnetic resonance (MR) brain images (OASIS-brains) and\nmulti-modal MR brain images (BraTS), MIASSR achieves comparable fidelity\nperformance and the best perceptual quality with the smallest model size.

          "description": "Visual localization is of great importance in robotics and computer vision.\nRecently, scene coordinate regression based methods have shown good performance\nin visual localization in small static scenes. However, it still estimates\ncamera poses from many inferior scene coordinates. To address this problem, we\npropose a novel visual localization framework that establishes 2D-to-3D\ncorrespondences between the query image and the 3D map with a series of\nlearnable scene-specific landmarks. In the landmark generation stage, the 3D\nsurfaces of the target scene are over-segmented into mosaic patches whose\ncenters are regarded as the scene-specific landmarks. To robustly and\naccurately recover the scene-specific landmarks, we propose the Voting with\nSegmentation Network (VS-Net) to segment the pixels into different landmark\npatches with a segmentation branch and estimate the landmark locations within\neach patch with a landmark location voting branch. Since the number of\nlandmarks in a scene may reach up to 5000, training a segmentation network with\nsuch a large number of classes is both computation and memory costly for the\ncommonly used cross-entropy loss. We propose a novel prototype-based triplet\nloss with hard negative mining, which is able to train semantic segmentation\nnetworks with a large number of labels efficiently.

          "description": "We consider the challenging blind denoising problem for Poisson-Gaussian\nnoise, in which no additional information about clean images or noise level\nparameters is available. Particularly, when only \"single\" noisy images are\navailable for training a denoiser, the denoising performance of existing\nmethods was not satisfactory. Recently, the blind pixelwise affine image\ndenoiser (BP-AIDE) was proposed and significantly improved the performance in\nthe above setting, to the extent that it is competitive with denoisers which\nutilized additional information. However, BP-AIDE seriously suffered from slow\ninference time due to the inefficiency of noise level estimation procedure and\nthat of the blind-spot network (BSN) architecture it used. To that end, we\npropose Fast Blind Image Denoiser (FBI-Denoiser) for Poisson-Gaussian noise,\nwhich consists of two neural network models; 1) PGE-Net that estimates\nPoisson-Gaussian noise parameters 2000 times faster than the conventional\nmethods and 2) FBI-Net that realizes a much more efficient BSN for pixelwise\naffine denoiser in terms of the number of parameters and inference speed.\nConsequently, we show that our FBI-Denoiser blindly trained solely based on\nsingle noisy images can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on several\nreal-world noisy image benchmark datasets with much faster inference time (x\n10), compared to BP-AIDE. The official code of our method is available at\nhttps://github.com/csm9493/FBI-Denoiser.",

          "description": "Hand pose estimation is a crucial part of a wide range of augmented reality\nand human-computer interaction applications. Predicting the 3D hand pose from a\nsingle RGB image is challenging due to occlusion and depth ambiguities.\nGCN-based (Graph Convolutional Networks) methods exploit the structural\nrelationship similarity between graphs and hand joints to model kinematic\ndependencies between joints. These techniques use predefined or globally\nlearned joint relationships, which may fail to capture pose-dependent\nconstraints. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage GCN-based\nframework that learns per-pose relationship constraints. Specifically, the\nfirst phase quantizes the 2D/3D space to classify the joints into 2D/3D blocks\nbased on their locality. This spatial dependency information guides this phase\nto estimate reliable 2D and 3D poses. The second stage further improves the 3D\nestimation through a GCN-based module that uses an adaptative nearest neighbor\nalgorithm to determine joint relationships. Extensive experiments show that our\nmulti-stage GCN approach yields an efficient model that produces accurate 2D/3D\nhand poses and outperforms the state-of-the-art on two public datasets.",

          "description": "Searching for a more compact network width recently serves as an effective\nway of channel pruning for the deployment of convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) under hardware constraints. To fulfill the searching, a one-shot\nsupernet is usually leveraged to efficiently evaluate the performance\n\\wrt~different network widths. However, current methods mainly follow a\n\\textit{unilaterally augmented} (UA) principle for the evaluation of each\nwidth, which induces the training unfairness of channels in supernet. In this\npaper, we introduce a new supernet called Bilaterally Coupled Network (BCNet)\nto address this issue. In BCNet, each channel is fairly trained and responsible\nfor the same amount of network widths, thus each network width can be evaluated\nmore accurately. Besides, we leverage a stochastic complementary strategy for\ntraining the BCNet, and propose a prior initial population sampling method to\nboost the performance of the evolutionary search. Extensive experiments on\nbenchmark CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets indicate that our method can achieve\nstate-of-the-art or competing performance over other baseline methods.\nMoreover, our method turns out to further boost the performance of NAS models\nby refining their network widths. For example, with the same FLOPs budget, our\nobtained EfficientNet-B0 achieves 77.36\\% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet dataset,\nsurpassing the performance of original setting by 0.48\\%.",

          "description": "As global trends are shifting towards data-driven industries, the demand for\nautomated algorithms that can convert digital images of scanned documents into\nmachine readable information is rapidly growing. Besides the opportunity of\ndata digitization for the application of data analytic tools, there is also a\nmassive improvement towards automation of processes, which previously would\nrequire manual inspection of the documents. Although the introduction of\noptical character recognition technologies mostly solved the task of converting\nhuman-readable characters from images into machine-readable characters, the\ntask of extracting table semantics has been less focused on over the years. The\nrecognition of tables consists of two main tasks, namely table detection and\ntable structure recognition. Most prior work on this problem focuses on either\ntask without offering an end-to-end solution or paying attention to real\napplication conditions like rotated images or noise artefacts inside the\ndocument image. Recent work shows a clear trend towards deep learning\napproaches coupled with the use of transfer learning for the task of table\nstructure recognition due to the lack of sufficiently large datasets. In this\npaper we present a multistage pipeline named Multi-Type-TD-TSR, which offers an\nend-to-end solution for the problem of table recognition. It utilizes\nstate-of-the-art deep learning models for table detection and differentiates\nbetween 3 different types of tables based on the tables' borders. For the table\nstructure recognition we use a deterministic non-data driven algorithm, which\nworks on all table types. We additionally present two algorithms. One for\nunbordered tables and one for bordered tables, which are the base of the used\ntable structure recognition algorithm. We evaluate Multi-Type-TD-TSR on the\nICDAR 2019 table structure recognition dataset and achieve a new\nstate-of-the-art.",

          "description": "Objective: To assess automatic computer-aided in-situ recognition of\nmorphological features of pure and mixed urinary stones using intraoperative\ndigital endoscopic images acquired in a clinical setting. Materials and\nmethods: In this single-centre study, an experienced urologist intraoperatively\nand prospectively examined the surface and section of all kidney stones\nencountered. Calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM/Ia), dihydrate (COD/IIb) and uric\nacid (UA/IIIb) morphological criteria were collected and classified to generate\nannotated datasets. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to\npredict the composition of both pure and mixed stones. To explain the\npredictions of the deep neural network model, coarse localisation heat-maps\nwere plotted to pinpoint key areas identified by the network. Results: This\nstudy included 347 and 236 observations of stone surface and stone section,\nrespectively. A highest sensitivity of 98 % was obtained for the type \"pure\nIIIb/UA\" using surface images. The most frequently encountered morphology was\nthat of the type \"pure Ia/COM\"; it was correctly predicted in 91 % and 94 % of\ncases using surface and section images, respectively. Of the mixed type\n\"Ia/COM+IIb/COD\", Ia/COM was predicted in 84 % of cases using surface images,\nIIb/COD in 70 % of cases, and both in 65 % of cases. Concerning mixed\nIa/COM+IIIb/UA stones, Ia/COM was predicted in 91 % of cases using section\nimages, IIIb/UA in 69 % of cases, and both in 74 % of cases. Conclusions: This\npreliminary study demonstrates that deep convolutional neural networks are\npromising to identify kidney stone composition from endoscopic images acquired\nintraoperatively. Both pure and mixed stone composition could be discriminated.\nCollected in a clinical setting, surface and section images analysed by deep\nCNN provide valuable information about stone morphology for computer-aided\ndiagnosis.",

          "description": "Background: The quantitative analysis of microscope videos often requires\ninstance segmentation and tracking of cellular and subcellular objects. The\ntraditional method consists of two stages: (1) performing instance object\nsegmentation of each frame, and (2) associating objects frame-by-frame.\nRecently, pixel-embedding-based deep learning approaches these two steps\nsimultaneously as a single stage holistic solution. In computer vision,\nannotated training data with consistent segmentation and tracking is resource\nintensive, the severity of which is multiplied in microscopy imaging due to (1)\ndense objects (e.g., overlapping or touching), and (2) high dynamics (e.g.,\nirregular motion and mitosis). Adversarial simulations have provided successful\nsolutions to alleviate the lack of such annotations in dynamics scenes in\ncomputer vision, such as using simulated environments (e.g., computer games) to\ntrain real-world self-driving systems. Methods: In this paper, we propose an\nannotation-free synthetic instance segmentation and tracking (ASIST) method\nwith adversarial simulation and single-stage pixel-embedding based learning.\nContribution: The contribution of this paper is three-fold: (1) the proposed\nmethod aggregates adversarial simulations and single-stage pixel-embedding\nbased deep learning; (2) the method is assessed with both the cellular (i.e.,\nHeLa cells) and subcellular (i.e., microvilli) objects; and (3) to the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first study to explore annotation-free instance\nsegmentation and tracking study for microscope videos. Results: The ASIST\nmethod achieved an important step forward, when compared with fully supervised\napproaches: ASIST shows 7% to 11% higher segmentation, detection and tracking\nperformance on microvilli relative to fully supervised methods, and comparable\nperformance on Hela cell videos.",

          "description": "Constructing effective image priors is critical to solving ill-posed inverse\nproblems in image processing and imaging. Recent works proposed to exploit\nimage non-local similarity for inverse problems by grouping similar patches and\ndemonstrated state-of-the-art results in many applications. However, compared\nto classic methods based on filtering or sparsity, most of the non-local\nalgorithms are time-consuming, mainly due to the highly inefficient and\nredundant block matching step, where the distance between each pair of\noverlapping patches needs to be computed. In this work, we propose a novel\nSelf-Convolution operator to exploit image non-local similarity in a\nself-supervised way. The proposed Self-Convolution can generalize the\ncommonly-used block matching step and produce equivalent results with much\ncheaper computation. Furthermore, by applying Self-Convolution, we propose an\neffective multi-modality image restoration scheme, which is much more efficient\nthan conventional block matching for non-local modeling. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that (1) Self-Convolution can significantly speed up most of the\npopular non-local image restoration algorithms, with two-fold to nine-fold\nfaster block matching, and (2) the proposed multi-modality image restoration\nscheme achieves superior denoising results in both efficiency and effectiveness\non RGB-NIR images.

          "description": "Searching for objects in indoor organized environments such as homes or\noffices is part of our everyday activities. When looking for a target object,\nwe jointly reason about the rooms and containers the object is likely to be in;\nthe same type of container will have a different probability of having the\ntarget depending on the room it is in. We also combine geometric and semantic\ninformation to infer what container is best to search, or what other objects\nare best to move, if the target object is hidden from view. We propose to use a\n3D scene graph representation to capture the hierarchical, semantic, and\ngeometric aspects of this problem. To exploit this representation in a search\nprocess, we introduce Hierarchical Mechanical Search (HMS), a method that\nguides an agent's actions towards finding a target object specified with a\nnatural language description. HMS is based on a novel neural network\narchitecture that uses neural message passing of vectors with visual,\ngeometric, and linguistic information to allow HMS to reason across layers of\nthe graph while combining semantic and geometric cues. HMS is evaluated on a\nnovel dataset of 500 3D scene graphs with dense placements of semantically\nrelated objects in storage locations, and is shown to be significantly better\nthan several baselines at finding objects and close to the oracle policy in\nterms of the median number of actions required.

We evaluate three pretrained V&L models on these tasks: ViLBERT,\nViLBERT 12-in-1 and LXMERT, in zero-shot and finetuned settings. Our results\nshow that models solve task (1) very well, as expected, since all models are\npretrained on task (1). However, none of the pretrained V&L models is able to\nadequately solve task (2), our counting probe, and they cannot generalise to\nout-of-distribution quantities. We propose a number of explanations for these\nfindings: LXMERT (and to some extent ViLBERT 12-in-1) show some evidence of\ncatastrophic forgetting on task (1). Concerning our results on the counting\nprobe, we find evidence that all models are impacted by dataset bias, and also\nfail to individuate entities in the visual input.

Second, these features are also excellent\nk-NN classifiers, reaching 78.3% top-1 on ImageNet with a small ViT.

On top of this framework, weakly-supervised loss (WSL), label\nattention and random pseudo-label sampling (RPS) strategies are introduced to\nrelax these assumptions, bringing additional improvement on the efficacy of the\ndetection pipeline.

          "description": "Zero-shot object recognition or zero-shot learning aims to transfer the\nobject recognition ability among the semantically related categories, such as\nfine-grained animal or bird species. However, the images of different\nfine-grained objects tend to merely exhibit subtle differences in appearance,\nwhich will severely deteriorate zero-shot object recognition. To reduce the\nsuperfluous information in the fine-grained objects, in this paper, we propose\nto learn the redundancy-free features for generalized zero-shot learning. We\nachieve our motivation by projecting the original visual features into a new\n(redundancy-free) feature space and then restricting the statistical dependence\nbetween these two feature spaces. Furthermore, we require the projected\nfeatures to keep and even strengthen the category relationship in the\nredundancy-free feature space. In this way, we can remove the redundant\ninformation from the visual features without losing the discriminative\ninformation. We extensively evaluate the performance on four benchmark\ndatasets. The results show that our redundancy-free feature based generalized\nzero-shot learning (RFF-GZSL) approach can achieve competitive results compared\nwith the state-of-the-arts.",

          "description": "With the explosive growth of video data, video summarization, which attempts\nto seek the minimum subset of frames while still conveying the main story, has\nbecome one of the hottest topics. Nowadays, substantial achievements have been\nmade by supervised learning techniques, especially after the emergence of deep\nlearning. However, it is extremely expensive and difficult to collect human\nannotation for large-scale video datasets. To address this problem, we propose\na convolutional attentive adversarial network (CAAN), whose key idea is to\nbuild a deep summarizer in an unsupervised way. Upon the generative adversarial\nnetwork, our overall framework consists of a generator and a discriminator. The\nformer predicts importance scores for all frames of a video while the latter\ntries to distinguish the score-weighted frame features from original frame\nfeatures. Specifically, the generator employs a fully convolutional sequence\nnetwork to extract global representation of a video, and an attention-based\nnetwork to output normalized importance scores. To learn the parameters, our\nobjective function is composed of three loss functions, which can guide the\nframe-level importance score prediction collaboratively. To validate this\nproposed method, we have conducted extensive experiments on two public\nbenchmarks SumMe and TVSum. The results show the superiority of our proposed\nmethod against other state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches. Our method even\noutperforms some published supervised approaches.",

          "description": "3D action recognition is referred to as the classification of action\nsequences which consist of 3D skeleton joints. While many research work are\ndevoted to 3D action recognition, it mainly suffers from three problems: highly\ncomplicated articulation, a great amount of noise, and a low implementation\nefficiency. To tackle all these problems, we propose a real-time 3D action\nrecognition framework by integrating the locally aggregated kinematic-guided\nskeletonlet (LAKS) with a supervised hashing-by-analysis (SHA) model. We first\ndefine the skeletonlet as a few combinations of joint offsets grouped in terms\nof kinematic principle, and then represent an action sequence using LAKS, which\nconsists of a denoising phase and a locally aggregating phase. The denoising\nphase detects the noisy action data and adjust it by replacing all the features\nwithin it with the features of the corresponding previous frame, while the\nlocally aggregating phase sums the difference between an offset feature of the\nskeletonlet and its cluster center together over all the offset features of the\nsequence. Finally, the SHA model which combines sparse representation with a\nhashing model, aiming at promoting the recognition accuracy while maintaining a\nhigh efficiency. Experimental results on MSRAction3D, UTKinectAction3D and\nFlorence3DAction datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in both recognition accuracy and implementation\nefficiency.",

Most works apply\nadversarial learning in the ambient image space, which could be computationally\nexpensive and challenging to train. In this paper, we propose to deploy an\nenergy-based model (EBM) in the latent space of a pretrained autoencoder for\nthis task. The pretrained autoencoder serves as both a latent code extractor\nand an image reconstruction worker. Our model, LETIT, is based on the\nassumption that two domains share the same latent space, where latent\nrepresentation is implicitly decomposed as a content code and a domain-specific\nstyle code. Instead of explicitly extracting the two codes and applying\nadaptive instance normalization to combine them, our latent EBM can implicitly\nlearn to transport the source style code to the target style code while\npreserving the content code, an advantage over existing image translation\nmethods. This simplified solution is also more efficient in the one-sided\nunpaired image translation setting. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons\ndemonstrate superior translation quality and faithfulness for content\npreservation.

As such, it represents one of\nthe most promising imaging techniques in structural biology. However, raw\ncryo-EM images are only highly corrupted - noisy and band-pass filtered - 2D\nprojections of the target 3D biomolecules. Reconstructing the 3D molecular\nshape starts with the removal of image outliers, the estimation of the\norientation of the biomolecule that has produced the given 2D image, and the\nestimation of camera parameters to correct for intensity defects. Current\ntechniques performing these tasks are often computationally expensive, while\nthe dataset sizes keep growing. There is a need for next-generation algorithms\nthat preserve accuracy while improving speed and scalability. In this paper, we\ncombine variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks\n(GANs) to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of cryo-EM images. We\nperform an exploratory analysis of the obtained latent space, that is shown to\nhave a structure of \"orbits\", in the sense of Lie group theory, consistent with\nthe acquisition procedure of cryo-EM images. This analysis leads us to design\nan estimation method for orientation and camera parameters of single-particle\ncryo-EM images, together with an outliers detection procedure. As such, it\nopens the door to geometric approaches for unsupervised estimations of\norientations and camera parameters, making possible fast cryo-EM biomolecule\nreconstruction.",

In this paper, we propose a multi-level attentive\nConvolutional Neural Network (MLAttnCNN) for crowd counting. We extract\nhigh-level contextual information with multiple different scales applied in\npooling, and use multi-level attention modules to enrich the characteristics at\ndifferent layers to achieve more efficient multi-scale feature fusion, which is\nable to be used to generate a more accurate density map with dilated\nconvolutions and a $1\\times 1$ convolution.

In this paper, we address\nthis problem from three aspects by devising an efficient network structure,\nproposing three effective training strategies, and exploiting four useful\npostprocessing techniques. First, we find that context information plays an\nimportant role in reasoning human body configuration and invisible keypoints.\nInspired by this, we propose a cascaded context mixer (CCM), which efficiently\nintegrates spatial and channel context information and progressively refines\nthem. Then, to maximize CCM's representation capability, we develop a\nhard-negative person detection mining strategy and a joint-training strategy by\nexploiting abundant unlabeled data. It enables CCM to learn discriminative\nfeatures from massive diverse poses. Third, we present several sub-pixel\nrefinement techniques for postprocessing keypoint predictions to improve\ndetection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the MS COCO keypoint detection\nbenchmark demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over\nrepresentative state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our single model achieves\ncomparable performance with the winner of the 2018 COCO Keypoint Detection\nChallenge. The final ensemble model sets a new SOTA on this benchmark.",

          "description": "The creation of altered and manipulated faces has become more common due to\nthe improvement of DeepFake generation methods. Simultaneously, we have seen\ndetection models' development for differentiating between a manipulated and\noriginal face from image or video content. We have observed that most publicly\navailable DeepFake detection datasets have limited variations, where a single\nface is used in many videos, resulting in an oversampled training dataset. Due\nto this, deep neural networks tend to overfit to the facial features instead of\nlearning to detect manipulation features of DeepFake content. As a result, most\ndetection architectures perform poorly when tested on unseen data. In this\npaper, we provide a quantitative analysis to investigate this problem and\npresent a solution to prevent model overfitting due to the high volume of\nsamples generated from a small number of actors. We introduce Face-Cutout, a\ndata augmentation method for training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to\nimprove DeepFake detection. In this method, training images with various\nocclusions are dynamically generated using face landmark information\nirrespective of orientation. Unlike other general-purpose augmentation methods,\nit focuses on the facial information that is crucial for DeepFake detection.\nOur method achieves a reduction in LogLoss of 15.2% to 35.3% on different\ndatasets, compared to other occlusion-based augmentation techniques. We show\nthat Face-Cutout can be easily integrated with any CNN-based recognition model\nand improve detection performance.",

          "description": "The rapid increment of morbidity of brain stroke in the last few years have\nbeen a driving force towards fast and accurate segmentation of stroke lesions\nfrom brain MRI images. With the recent development of deep-learning,\ncomputer-aided and segmentation methods of ischemic stroke lesions have been\nuseful for clinicians in early diagnosis and treatment planning. However, most\nof these methods suffer from inaccurate and unreliable segmentation results\nbecause of their inability to capture sufficient contextual features from the\nMRI volumes. To meet these requirements, 3D convolutional neural networks have\nbeen proposed, which, however, suffer from huge computational requirements. To\nmitigate these problems, we propose a novel Dimension Fusion Edge-guided\nnetwork (DFENet) that can meet both of these requirements by fusing the\nfeatures of 2D and 3D CNNs. Unlike other methods, our proposed network uses a\nparallel partial decoder (PPD) module for aggregating and upsampling selected\nfeatures, rich in important contextual information. Additionally, we use an\nedge-guidance and enhanced mixing loss for constantly supervising and\nimprovising the learning process of the network.

Although substantial progresses have been made in\nautomatic FER in the past few decades, previous studies are mainly designed for\nlab-controlled FER. Real-world occlusions, variant head poses and other issues\ndefinitely increase the difficulty of FER on account of these\ninformation-deficient regions and complex backgrounds. Different from previous\npure CNNs based methods, we argue that it is feasible and practical to\ntranslate facial images into sequences of visual words and perform expression\nrecognition from a global perspective. Therefore, we propose Convolutional\nVisual Transformers to tackle FER in the wild by two main steps. First, we\npropose an attentional selective fusion (ASF) for leveraging the feature maps\ngenerated by two-branch CNNs. The ASF captures discriminative information by\nfusing multiple features with global-local attention. The fused feature maps\nare then flattened and projected into sequences of visual words. Second,\ninspired by the success of Transformers in natural language processing, we\npropose to model relationships between these visual words with global\nself-attention. The proposed method are evaluated on three public in-the-wild\nfacial expression datasets (RAF-DB, FERPlus and AffectNet).

We propose to map and count oil palms by\nestimating tree densities per pixel for large-scale analysis. This allows for\nfine-grained analysis, for example regarding different planting patterns. To\nthat end, we propose a new, active deep learning method to estimate oil palm\ndensity at large scale from Sentinel-2 satellite images, and apply it to\ngenerate complete maps for Malaysia and Indonesia. What makes the regression of\noil palm density challenging is the need for representative reference data that\ncovers all relevant geographical conditions across a large territory.\nSpecifically for density estimation, generating reference data involves\ncounting individual trees. To keep the associated labelling effort low we\npropose an active learning (AL) approach that automatically chooses the most\nrelevant samples to be labelled. Our method relies on estimates of the\nepistemic model uncertainty and of the diversity among samples, making it\npossible to retrieve an entire batch of relevant samples in a single iteration.\nMoreover, our algorithm has linear computational complexity and is easily\nparallelisable to cover large areas. We use our method to compute the first oil\npalm density map with $10\\,$m Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) , for all of\nIndonesia and Malaysia and for two different years, 2017 and 2019. The maps\nhave a mean absolute error of $\\pm$7.3 trees/$ha$, estimated from an\nindependent validation set.

          "description": "This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based video object matting method\nthat can achieve temporally coherent matting results. Its key component is an\nattention-based temporal aggregation module that maximizes image matting\nnetworks' strength for video matting networks. This module computes temporal\ncorrelations for pixels adjacent to each other along the time axis in feature\nspace to be robust against motion noises. We also design a novel loss term to\ntrain the attention weights, which drastically boosts the video matting\nperformance. Besides, we show how to effectively solve the trimap generation\nproblem by fine-tuning a state-of-the-art video object segmentation network\nwith a sparse set of user-annotated keyframes. To facilitate video matting and\ntrimap generation networks' training, we construct a large-scale video matting\ndataset with 80 training and 28 validation foreground video clips with\nground-truth alpha mattes. Experimental results show that our method can\ngenerate high-quality alpha mattes for various videos featuring appearance\nchange, occlusion, and fast motion.

          "description": "Recent advances in deep learning have led to breakthroughs in the development\nof automated skin disease classification. As we observe an increasing interest\nin these models in the dermatology space, it is crucial to address aspects such\nas the robustness towards input data distribution shifts. Current skin disease\nmodels could make incorrect inferences for test samples from different hardware\ndevices and clinical settings or unknown disease samples, which are\nout-of-distribution (OOD) from the training samples.To this end, we propose a\nsimple yet effective approach that detect these OOD samples prior to making any\ndecision. The detection is performed via scanning in the latent space\nrepresentation (e.g., activations of the inner layers of any pre-trained skin\ndisease classifier). The input samples could also perturbed to maximise\ndivergence of OOD samples. We validate our ODD detection approach in two use\ncases: 1) identify samples collected from different protocols, and 2) detect\nsamples from unknown disease classes. Additionally, we evaluate the performance\nof the proposed approach and compare it with other state-of-the-art methods.\nFurthermore, data-driven dermatology applications may deepen the disparity in\nclinical care across racial and ethnic groups since most datasets are reported\nto suffer from bias in skin tone distribution. Therefore, we also evaluate the\nfairness of these OOD detection methods across different skin tones. Our\nexperiments resulted in competitive performance across multiple datasets in\ndetecting OOD samples, which could be used (in the future) to design more\neffective transfer learning techniques prior to inferring on these samples.",

To take temporal action localization to a\nnew level, we develop FineAction, a new large-scale fined video dataset\ncollected from existing video datasets and web videos. Overall, this dataset\ncontains 139K fined action instances densely annotated in almost 17K untrimmed\nvideos spanning 106 action categories. FineAction has a more fined definition\nof action categories and high-quality annotations to reduce the boundary\nuncertainty compared to the existing action localization datasets.

          "description": "In contrast to the oriented bounding boxes, point set representation has\ngreat potential to capture the detailed structure of instances with the\narbitrary orientations, large aspect ratios and dense distribution in aerial\nimages. However, the conventional point set-based approaches are handcrafted\nwith the fixed locations using points-to-points supervision, which hurts their\nflexibility on the fine-grained feature extraction. To address these\nlimitations, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to aerial object\ndetection, named Oriented RepPoints. Specifically, we suggest to employ a set\nof adaptive points to capture the geometric and spatial information of the\narbitrary-oriented objects, which is able to automatically arrange themselves\nover the object in a spatial and semantic scenario. To facilitate the\nsupervised learning, the oriented conversion function is proposed to explicitly\nmap the adaptive point set into an oriented bounding box. Moreover, we\nintroduce an effective quality assessment measure to select the point set\nsamples for training, which can choose the representative items with respect to\ntheir potentials on orientated object detection. Furthermore, we suggest a\nspatial constraint to penalize the outlier points outside the ground-truth\nbounding box. In addition to the traditional evaluation metric mAP focusing on\noverlap ratio, we propose a new metric mAOE to measure the orientation accuracy\nthat is usually neglected in the previous studies on oriented object detection.\nExperiments on three widely used datasets including DOTA, HRSC2016 and UCAS-AOD\ndemonstrate that our proposed approach is effective.",

          "description": "Recently, most siamese network based trackers locate targets via object\nclassification and bounding-box regression. Generally, they select the\nbounding-box with maximum classification confidence as the final prediction.\nThis strategy may miss the right result due to the accuracy misalignment\nbetween classification and regression. In this paper, we propose a novel\nsiamese tracking algorithm called SiamRCR, addressing this problem with a\nsimple, light and effective solution. It builds reciprocal links between\nclassification and regression branches, which can dynamically re-weight their\nlosses for each positive sample. In addition, we add a localization branch to\npredict the localization accuracy, so that it can work as the replacement of\nthe regression assistance link during inference. This branch makes the training\nand inference more consistent. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of SiamRCR and its superiority over the state-of-the-art\ncompetitors on GOT-10k, LaSOT, TrackingNet, OTB-2015, VOT-2018 and VOT-2019.\nMoreover, our SiamRCR runs at 65 FPS, far above the real-time requirement.",

          "description": "Puck localization is an important problem in ice hockey video analytics\nuseful for analyzing the game, determining play location, and assessing puck\npossession. The problem is challenging due to the small size of the puck,\nexcessive motion blur due to high puck velocity and occlusions due to players\nand boards. In this paper, we introduce and implement a network for puck\nlocalization in broadcast hockey video. The network leverages expert NHL\nplay-by-play annotations and uses temporal context to locate the puck. Player\nlocations are incorporated into the network through an attention mechanism by\nencoding player positions with a Gaussian-based spatial heatmap drawn at player\npositions. Since event occurrence on the rink and puck location are related, we\nalso perform event recognition by augmenting the puck localization network with\nan event recognition head and training the network through multi-task learning.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the network is able to localize the puck\nwith an AUC of $73.1 \\%$ on the test set. The puck location can be inferred in\n720p broadcast videos at $5$ frames per second. It is also demonstrated that\nmulti-task learning with puck location improves event recognition accuracy.",

          "description": "Video prediction is a challenging task with wide application prospects in\nmeteorology and robot systems. Existing works fail to trade off short-term and\nlong-term prediction performances and extract robust latent dynamics laws in\nvideo frames. We propose a two-branch seq-to-seq deep model to disentangle the\nTaylor feature and the residual feature in video frames by a novel recurrent\nprediction module (TaylorCell) and residual module. TaylorCell can expand the\nvideo frames' high-dimensional features into the finite Taylor series to\ndescribe the latent laws. In TaylorCell, we propose the Taylor prediction unit\n(TPU) and the memory correction unit (MCU). TPU employs the first input frame's\nderivative information to predict the future frames, avoiding error\naccumulation. MCU distills all past frames' information to correct the\npredicted Taylor feature from TPU. Correspondingly, the residual module\nextracts the residual feature complementary to the Taylor feature. On three\ngeneralist datasets (Moving MNIST, TaxiBJ, Human 3.6), our model outperforms or\nreaches state-of-the-art models, and ablation experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our model in long-term prediction.",

          "description": "3D ultrasound (US) has become prevalent due to its rich spatial and\ndiagnostic information not contained in 2D US. Moreover, 3D US can contain\nmultiple standard planes (SPs) in one shot. Thus, automatically localizing SPs\nin 3D US has the potential to improve user-independence and\nscanning-efficiency. However, manual SP localization in 3D US is challenging\nbecause of the low image quality, huge search space and large anatomical\nvariability. In this work, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL) framework to simultaneously localize multiple SPs in 3D US. Our\ncontribution is four-fold. First, our proposed method is general and it can\naccurately localize multiple SPs in different challenging US datasets. Second,\nwe equip the MARL system with a recurrent neural network (RNN) based\ncollaborative module, which can strengthen the communication among agents and\nlearn the spatial relationship among planes effectively. Third, we explore to\nadopt the neural architecture search (NAS) to automatically design the network\narchitecture of both the agents and the collaborative module. Last, we believe\nwe are the first to realize automatic SP localization in pelvic US volumes, and\nnote that our approach can handle both normal and abnormal uterus cases.\nExtensively validated on two challenging datasets of the uterus and fetal\nbrain, our proposed method achieves the average localization accuracy of 7.03\ndegrees/1.59mm and 9.75 degrees/1.19mm. Experimental results show that our\nlight-weight MARL model has higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Supervised deep learning has swiftly become a workhorse for accelerated MRI\nin recent years, offering state-of-the-art performance in image reconstruction\nfrom undersampled acquisitions. Training deep supervised models requires large\ndatasets of undersampled and fully-sampled acquisitions typically from a\nmatching set of subjects. Given scarce access to large medical datasets, this\nlimitation has sparked interest in unsupervised methods that reduce reliance on\nfully-sampled ground-truth data. A common framework is based on the deep image\nprior, where network-driven regularization is enforced directly during\ninference on undersampled acquisitions. Yet, canonical convolutional\narchitectures are suboptimal in capturing long-range relationships, and\nrandomly initialized networks may hamper convergence. To address these\nlimitations, here we introduce a novel unsupervised MRI reconstruction method\nbased on zero-Shot Learned Adversarial TransformERs (SLATER). SLATER embodies a\ndeep adversarial network with cross-attention transformer blocks to map noise\nand latent variables onto MR images. This unconditional network learns a\nhigh-quality MRI prior in a self-supervised encoding task. A zero-shot\nreconstruction is performed on undersampled test data, where inference is\nperformed by optimizing network parameters, latent and noise variables to\nensure maximal consistency to multi-coil MRI data. Comprehensive experiments on\nbrain MRI datasets clearly demonstrate the superior performance of SLATER\nagainst several state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.",

This paper proposes a novel series-parallel hybrid paradigm called the\nChained Context Aggregation Module (CAM) to diversify feature propagation. CAM\ngains features of various spatial scales through chain-connected ladder-style\ninformation flows and fuses them in a two-stage process, namely pre-fusion and\nre-fusion. The serial flow continuously increases receptive fields of output\nneurons and those in parallel encode different region-based contexts. Each\ninformation flow is a shallow encoder-decoder with appropriate down-sampling\nscales to sufficiently capture contextual information. We further adopt an\nattention model in CAM to guide feature re-fusion.

          "description": "The Gleason scoring system is the primary diagnostic and prognostic tool for\nprostate cancer. In recent years, with the development of digitisation devices,\nthe use of computer vision techniques for the analysis of biopsies has\nincreased. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the development of\nalgorithms to automatically detect individual cribriform patterns belonging to\nGleason grade 4 has not yet been studied in the literature. The objective of\nthe work presented in this paper is to develop a deep-learning-based system\nable to support pathologists in the daily analysis of prostate biopsies. The\nmethodological core of this work is a patch-wise predictive model based on\nconvolutional neural networks able to determine the presence of cancerous\npatterns. In particular, we train from scratch a simple self-design\narchitecture. The cribriform pattern is detected by retraining the set of\nfilters of the last convolutional layer in the network. From the reconstructed\nprediction map, we compute the percentage of each Gleason grade in the tissue\nto feed a multi-layer perceptron which provides a biopsy-level score.mIn our\nSICAPv2 database, composed of 182 annotated whole slide images, we obtained a\nCohen's quadratic kappa of 0.77 in the test set for the patch-level Gleason\ngrading with the proposed architecture trained from scratch. Our results\noutperform previous ones reported in the literature. Furthermore, this model\nreaches the level of fine-tuned state-of-the-art architectures in a\npatient-based four groups cross validation. In the cribriform pattern detection\ntask, we obtained an area under ROC curve of 0.82. Regarding the biopsy Gleason\nscoring, we achieved a quadratic Cohen's Kappa of 0.81 in the test subset.\nShallow CNN architectures trained from scratch outperform current\nstate-of-the-art methods for Gleason grades classification.",

The\nperformance of CNNs in classification tasks have been shown dependent on\ntraining data set size and number of classes. Where prior works have used\nrelatively small surrogate model data sets ($<100$ models), the question\nremains as to the ability of a CNN to differentiate between models in\nincreasingly large model repositories. This paper presents a method for\ngenerating synthetic image data sets from online CAD model repositories, and\nfurther investigates the capacity of an off-the-shelf CNN architecture trained\non synthetic data to classify models as class size increases. 1,000 CAD models\nwere curated and processed to generate large scale surrogate data sets,\nfeaturing model coverage at steps of 10$^{\\circ}$, 30$^{\\circ}$, 60$^{\\circ}$,\nand 120$^{\\circ}$ degrees. The findings demonstrate the capability of computer\nvision algorithms to classify artefacts in model repositories of up to 200,\nbeyond this point the CNN's performance is observed to deteriorate\nsignificantly, limiting its present ability for automated twinning of physical\nto digital artefacts.

          "description": "Prostate cancer is one of the main diseases affecting men worldwide. The gold\nstandard for diagnosis and prognosis is the Gleason grading system. In this\nprocess, pathologists manually analyze prostate histology slides under\nmicroscope, in a high time-consuming and subjective task. In the last years,\ncomputer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) systems have emerged as a promising tool that\ncould support pathologists in the daily clinical practice. Nevertheless, these\nsystems are usually trained using tedious and prone-to-error pixel-level\nannotations of Gleason grades in the tissue. To alleviate the need of manual\npixel-wise labeling, just a handful of works have been presented in the\nliterature. Motivated by this, we propose a novel weakly-supervised\ndeep-learning model, based on self-learning CNNs, that leverages only the\nglobal Gleason score of gigapixel whole slide images during training to\naccurately perform both, grading of patch-level patterns and biopsy-level\nscoring. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we perform\nextensive experiments on three different external datasets for the patch-level\nGleason grading, and on two different test sets for global Grade Group\nprediction. We empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms its\nsupervised counterpart on patch-level Gleason grading by a large margin, as\nwell as state-of-the-art methods on global biopsy-level scoring. Particularly,\nthe proposed model brings an average improvement on the Cohen's quadratic kappa\n(k) score of nearly 18% compared to full-supervision for the patch-level\nGleason grading task.",

We explore what induces\nregularity for spatial transformations, e.g., when computing image\nregistrations. Classical optimization-based models compute maps between pairs\nof samples and rely on an appropriate regularizer for well-posedness. Recent\ndeep learning approaches have attempted to avoid using such regularizers\naltogether by relying on the sample population instead. We explore if it is\npossible to obtain spatial regularity using an inverse consistency loss only\nand elucidate what explains map regularity in such a context. We find that deep\nnetworks combined with an inverse consistency loss and randomized off-grid\ninterpolation yield well behaved, approximately diffeomorphic, spatial\ntransformations.

          "description": "Recently, there has been substantial progress in image synthesis from\nsemantic labelmaps. However, methods used for this task assume the availability\nof complete and unambiguous labelmaps, with instance boundaries of objects, and\nclass labels for each pixel. This reliance on heavily annotated inputs\nrestricts the application of image synthesis techniques to real-world\napplications, especially under uncertainty due to weather, occlusion, or noise.\nOn the other hand, algorithms that can synthesize images from sparse labelmaps\nor sketches are highly desirable as tools that can guide content creators and\nartists to quickly generate scenes by simply specifying locations of a few\nobjects. In this paper, we address the problem of complex scene completion from\nsparse labelmaps. Under this setting, very few details about the scene (30\\% of\nobject instances) are available as input for image synthesis. We propose a\ntwo-stage deep network based method, called `Halluci-Net', that learns\nco-occurence relationships between objects in scenes, and then exploits these\nrelationships to produce a dense and complete labelmap. The generated dense\nlabelmap can then be used as input by state-of-the-art image synthesis\ntechniques like pix2pixHD to obtain the final image. The proposed method is\nevaluated on the Cityscapes dataset and it outperforms two baselines methods on\nperformance metrics like Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID), semantic\nsegmentation accuracy, and similarity in object co-occurrences. We also show\nqualitative results on a subset of ADE20K dataset that contains bedroom images.",

          "description": "Visual attention is one of the most significant characteristics for selecting\nand understanding the outside redundancy world. The nature of complex scenes\nincludes enormous redundancy. The human vision system can not process all\ninformation simultaneously because of visual information bottleneck. The human\nvisual system mainly focuses on dominant parts of the scenes to reduce the\ninput visual redundancy information. It is commonly known as visual attention\nprediction or visual saliency map. This paper proposes a new psychophysical\nsaliency prediction architecture, WECSF, inspired by human low-level visual\ncortex function. The model consists of opponent color channels, wavelet\ntransform, wavelet energy map, and contrast sensitivity function for extracting\nlow-level image features and maximum approximation to the human visual system.\nThe proposed model is evaluated several datasets, including MIT1003, MIT300,\nTORONTO, SID4VAM and UCF Sports dataset to explain its efficiency. We also\nquantitatively and qualitatively compared the performance of saliency\nprediction with other state-of-the-art models. Our model achieved very stable\nand good performance. Second, we also confirmed that Fourier and\nspectral-inspired saliency prediction models achieved outperformance compared\nto other start-of-the-art non-neural networks and even deep neural network\nmodels on psychophysical synthesis images. Finally, the proposed model also can\nbe applied to spatial-temporal saliency prediction and got better performance.",

In our approach, a 3D scene is\nrepresented as a light field, i.e., a set of rays, each of which has a\ncorresponding color when reaching the image plane. For efficient novel view\nrendering, we adopt a 4D parameterization of the light field, where each ray is\ncharacterized by a 4D parameter. We then formulate the light field as a 4D\nfunction that maps 4D coordinates to corresponding color values.

Then, the scene-specific model is used to synthesize novel views.\nDifferent from previous light field approaches which require dense view\nsampling to reliably render novel views, our method can render novel views by\nsampling rays and querying the color for each ray from the network directly,\nthus enabling high-quality light field rendering with a sparser set of training\nimages.

While\nrecent Deep Learning-based solutions achieve satisfactory performance, their\nhigh computational cost renders their application in real-life settings in\nwhich computations need to be performed on embedded platforms intractable. In\nthis paper, we analyze the efficiency of two popular voxel-based 3D object\ndetection methods providing a good compromise between high performance and\nspeed based on two aspects, their ability to detect objects located at large\ndistances from the agent and their ability to operate in real time on embedded\nplatforms equipped with high-performance GPUs. Our experiments show that these\nmethods mostly fail to detect distant small objects due to the sparsity of the\ninput point clouds at large distances. Moreover, models trained on near objects\nachieve similar or better performance compared to those trained on all objects\nin the scene. This means that the models learn object appearance\nrepresentations mostly from near objects. Our findings suggest that a\nconsiderable part of the computations of existing methods is focused on\nlocations of the scene that do not contribute with successful detection. This\nmeans that the methods can achieve a speed-up of $40$-$60\\%$ by restricting\noperation to near objects while not sacrificing much in performance.",

          "description": "In image anomaly detection, Autoencoders are the popular methods that\nreconstruct the input image that might contain anomalies and output a clean\nimage with no abnormalities. These Autoencoder-based methods usually calculate\nthe anomaly score from the reconstruction error, the difference between the\ninput image and the reconstructed image. On the other hand, the accuracy of the\nreconstruction is insufficient in many of these methods, so it leads to\ndegraded accuracy of anomaly detection. To improve the accuracy of the\nreconstruction, we consider defining loss function in the frequency domain. In\ngeneral, we know that natural images contain many low-frequency components and\nfew high-frequency components. Hence, to improve the accuracy of the\nreconstruction of high-frequency components, we introduce a new loss function\nnamed weighted frequency domain loss(WFDL). WFDL provides a sharper\nreconstructed image, which contributes to improving the accuracy of anomaly\ndetection. In this paper, we show our method's superiority over the\nconventional Autoencoder methods by comparing it with AUROC on the MVTec AD\ndataset.",

          "description": "Human pose estimation has achieved significant progress in recent years.\nHowever, most of the recent methods focus on improving accuracy using\ncomplicated models and ignoring real-time efficiency. To achieve a better\ntrade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose a novel neural\narchitecture search (NAS) method, termed ViPNAS, to search networks in both\nspatial and temporal levels for fast online video pose estimation. In the\nspatial level, we carefully design the search space with five different\ndimensions including network depth, width, kernel size, group number, and\nattentions. In the temporal level, we search from a series of temporal feature\nfusions to optimize the total accuracy and speed across multiple video frames.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to search for the temporal\nfeature fusion and automatic computation allocation in videos. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging\nCOCO2017 and PoseTrack2018 datasets.

          "description": "Vision transformers (ViT) have demonstrated impressive performance across\nvarious machine vision problems. These models are based on multi-head\nself-attention mechanisms that can flexibly attend to a sequence of image\npatches to encode contextual cues. An important question is how such\nflexibility in attending image-wide context conditioned on a given patch can\nfacilitate handling nuisances in natural images e.g., severe occlusions, domain\nshifts, spatial permutations, adversarial and natural perturbations. We\nsystematically study this question via an extensive set of experiments\nencompassing three ViT families and comparisons with a high-performing\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). We show and analyze the following\nintriguing properties of ViT: (a) Transformers are highly robust to severe\nocclusions, perturbations and domain shifts, e.g., retain as high as 60% top-1\naccuracy on ImageNet even after randomly occluding 80% of the image content.\n(b) The robust performance to occlusions is not due to a bias towards local\ntextures, and ViTs are significantly less biased towards textures compared to\nCNNs. When properly trained to encode shape-based features, ViTs demonstrate\nshape recognition capability comparable to that of human visual system,\npreviously unmatched in the literature. (c) Using ViTs to encode shape\nrepresentation leads to an interesting consequence of accurate semantic\nsegmentation without pixel-level supervision. (d) Off-the-shelf features from a\nsingle ViT model can be combined to create a feature ensemble, leading to high\naccuracy rates across a range of classification datasets in both traditional\nand few-shot learning paradigms. We show effective features of ViTs are due to\nflexible and dynamic receptive fields possible via the self-attention\nmechanism.",

          "description": "Domain shift has always been one of the primary issues in video object\nsegmentation (VOS), for which models suffer from degeneration when tested on\nunfamiliar datasets. Recently, many online methods have emerged to narrow the\nperformance gap between training data (source domain) and test data (target\ndomain) by fine-tuning on annotations of test data which are usually in\nshortage. In this paper, we propose a novel method to tackle domain shift by\nfirst introducing adversarial domain adaptation to the VOS task, with\nsupervised training on the source domain and unsupervised training on the\ntarget domain. By fusing appearance and motion features with a convolution\nlayer, and by adding supervision onto the motion branch, our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on DAVIS2016 with 82.6% mean IoU score after\nsupervised training.

This\nis obtained via the visual analysis of cancerous patterns in prostate biopsies\nperformed by expert pathologists, and the aggregation of the main Gleason\ngrades in a combined score. Computer-aided diagnosis systems allow to reduce\nthe workload of pathologists and increase the objectivity. Recently, efforts\nhave been made in the literature to develop algorithms aiming the direct\nestimation of the global Gleason score at biopsy/core level with global labels.\nHowever, these algorithms do not cover the accurate localization of the Gleason\npatterns into the tissue. In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based system\nable to detect local cancerous patterns in the prostate tissue using only the\nglobal-level Gleason score during training. The methodological core of this\nwork is the proposed weakly-supervised-trained convolutional neural network,\nWeGleNet, based on a multi-class segmentation layer after the feature\nextraction module, a global-aggregation, and the slicing of the background\nclass for the model loss estimation during training. We obtained a Cohen's\nquadratic kappa (k) of 0.67 for the pixel-level prediction of cancerous\npatterns in the validation cohort. We compared the model performance for\nsemantic segmentation of Gleason grades with supervised state-of-the-art\narchitectures in the test cohort. We obtained a pixel-level k of 0.61 and a\nmacro-averaged f1-score of 0.58, at the same level as fully-supervised methods.\nRegarding the estimation of the core-level Gleason score, we obtained a k of\n0.76 and 0.67 between the model and two different pathologists. WeGleNet is\ncapable of performing the semantic segmentation of Gleason grades similarly to\nfully-supervised methods without requiring pixel-level annotations.",

          "description": "This paper presents a novel algorithm that registers a collection of\nmono-modal 3D images in a simultaneous fashion, named as Direct Simultaneous\nRegistration (DSR). The algorithm optimizes global poses of local frames\ndirectly based on the intensities of images (without extracting features from\nthe images). To obtain the optimal result, we start with formulating a Direct\nBundle Adjustment (DBA) problem which jointly optimizes pose parameters of\nlocal frames and intensities of panoramic image. By proving the independence of\nthe pose from panoramic image in the iterative process, DSR is proposed and\nproved to be able to generate the same optimal poses as DBA, but without\noptimizing the intensities of the panoramic image. The proposed DSR method is\nparticularly suitable in mono-modal registration and in the scenarios where\ndistinct features are not available, such as Transesophageal Echocardiography\n(TEE) images. The proposed method is validated via simulated and in-vivo 3D TEE\nimages.

Inspired by the powerful learning ability of deep\nlearning, we attempt to develop a general deep learning approach for\nhyperspectral unmixing, by fully considering the properties of endmembers\nextracted from the hyperspectral imagery, called endmember-guided unmixing\nnetwork (EGU-Net). Beyond the alone autoencoder-like architecture, EGU-Net is a\ntwo-stream Siamese deep network, which learns an additional network from the\npure or nearly-pure endmembers to correct the weights of another unmixing\nnetwork by sharing network parameters and adding spectrally meaningful\nconstraints (e.g., non-negativity and sum-to-one) towards a more accurate and\ninterpretable unmixing solution. Furthermore, the resulting general framework\nis not only limited to pixel-wise spectral unmixing but also applicable to\nspatial information modeling with convolutional operators for spatial-spectral\nunmixing. Experimental results conducted on three different datasets with the\nground-truth of abundance maps corresponding to each material demonstrate the\neffectiveness and superiority of the EGU-Net over state-of-the-art unmixing\nalgorithms.

          "description": "Few-shot learning (FSL) is the task of learning to recognize previously\nunseen categories of images from a small number of training examples. This is a\nchallenging task, as the available examples may not be enough to unambiguously\ndetermine which visual features are most characteristic of the considered\ncategories. To alleviate this issue, we propose a method that additionally\ntakes into account the names of the image classes. While the use of class names\nhas already been explored in previous work, our approach differs in two key\naspects. First, while previous work has aimed to directly predict visual\nprototypes from word embeddings, we found that better results can be obtained\nby treating visual and text-based prototypes separately. Second, we propose a\nsimple strategy for learning class name embeddings using the BERT language\nmodel, which we found to substantially outperform the GloVe vectors that were\nused in previous work. We furthermore propose a strategy for dealing with the\nhigh dimensionality of these vectors, inspired by models for aligning\ncross-lingual word embeddings. We provide experiments on miniImageNet, CUB and\ntieredImageNet, showing that our approach consistently improves the\nstate-of-the-art in metric-based FSL.",

          "description": "We develop a novel compositional generative model for zero- and few-shot\nlearning to recognize fine-grained classes with a few or no training samples.\nOur key observation is that generating holistic features for fine-grained\nclasses fails to capture small attribute differences between classes.\nTherefore, we propose a feature composition framework that learns to extract\nattribute features from training samples and combines them to construct\nfine-grained features for rare and unseen classes. Feature composition allows\nus to not only selectively compose features of every class from only relevant\ntraining samples, but also obtain diversity among composed features via\nchanging samples used for the composition. In addition, instead of building\nholistic features for classes, we use our attribute features to form dense\nrepresentations capable of capturing fine-grained attribute details of classes.\nWe propose a training scheme that uses a discriminative model to construct\nfeatures that are subsequently used to train the model itself. Therefore, we\ndirectly train the discriminative model on the composed features without\nlearning a separate generative model.

          "description": "Pelvic ring disruptions result from blunt injury mechanisms and are often\nfound in patients with multi-system trauma. To grade pelvic fracture severity\nin trauma victims based on whole-body CT, the Tile AO/OTA classification is\nfrequently used. Due to the high volume of whole-body trauma CTs generated in\nbusy trauma centers, an automated approach to Tile classification would provide\nsubstantial value, e.,g., to prioritize the reading queue of the attending\ntrauma radiologist. In such scenario, an automated method should perform\ngrading based on a transparent process and based on interpretable features to\nenable interaction with human readers and lower their workload by offering\ninsights from a first automated read of the scan. This paper introduces an\nautomated yet interpretable pelvic trauma decision support system to assist\nradiologists in fracture detection and Tile grade classification. The method\noperates similarly to human interpretation of CT scans and first detects\ndistinct pelvic fractures on CT with high specificity using a Faster-RCNN model\nthat are then interpreted using a structural causal model based on clinical\nbest practices to infer an initial Tile grade. The Bayesian causal model and\nfinally, the object detector are then queried for likely co-occurring fractures\nthat may have been rejected initially due to the highly specific operating\npoint of the detector, resulting in an updated list of detected fractures and\ncorresponding final Tile grade. Our method is transparent in that it provides\nfinding location and type using the object detector, as well as information on\nimportant counterfactuals that would invalidate the system's recommendation and\nachieves an AUC of 83.3%/85.1% for translational/rotational instability.\nDespite being designed for human-machine teaming, our approach does not\ncompromise on performance compared to previous black-box approaches.",

          "description": "We present a learning-based method for building driving-signal aware\nfull-body avatars. Our model is a conditional variational autoencoder that can\nbe animated with incomplete driving signals, such as human pose and facial\nkeypoints, and produces a high-quality representation of human geometry and\nview-dependent appearance. The core intuition behind our method is that better\ndrivability and generalization can be achieved by disentangling the driving\nsignals and remaining generative factors, which are not available during\nanimation. To this end, we explicitly account for information deficiency in the\ndriving signal by introducing a latent space that exclusively captures the\nremaining information, thus enabling the imputation of the missing factors\nrequired during full-body animation, while remaining faithful to the driving\nsignal. We also propose a learnable localized compression for the driving\nsignal which promotes better generalization, and helps minimize the influence\nof global chance-correlations often found in real datasets. For a given driving\nsignal, the resulting variational model produces a compact space of uncertainty\nfor missing factors that allows for an imputation strategy best suited to a\nparticular application. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on the\nchallenging problem of full-body animation for virtual telepresence with\ndriving signals acquired from minimal sensors placed in the environment and\nmounted on a VR-headset.",

The proposed AGN consists of three\nsteps. Firstly, we introduce a Bipartite Graph convolutional Network (BGN) to\nmodel the intrinsic geometric and semantic relations of ipsilateral views.\nSecondly, considering that the visual asymmetry of bilateral views is widely\nadopted in clinical practice to assist the diagnosis of breast lesions, we\npropose an Inception Graph convolutional Network (IGN) to model the structural\nsimilarities of bilateral views. Finally, based on the constructed graphs, the\nmulti-view information is propagated through nodes methodically, which equips\nthe features learned from the examined view with multi-view reasoning ability.\nExperiments on two standard benchmarks reveal that AGN significantly exceeds\nthe state-of-the-art performance.

          "description": "Hidden features in neural network usually fail to learn informative\nrepresentation for 3D segmentation as supervisions are only given on output\nprediction, while this can be solved by omni-scale supervision on intermediate\nlayers. In this paper, we bring the first omni-scale supervision method to\npoint cloud segmentation via the proposed gradual Receptive Field Component\nReasoning (RFCR), where target Receptive Field Component Codes (RFCCs) are\ndesigned to record categories within receptive fields for hidden units in the\nencoder. Then, target RFCCs will supervise the decoder to gradually infer the\nRFCCs in a coarse-to-fine categories reasoning manner, and finally obtain the\nsemantic labels. Because many hidden features are inactive with tiny magnitude\nand make minor contributions to RFCC prediction, we propose a Feature\nDensification with a centrifugal potential to obtain more unambiguous features,\nand it is in effect equivalent to entropy regularization over features. More\nactive features can further unleash the potential of our omni-supervision\nmethod. We embed our method into four prevailing backbones and test on three\nchallenging benchmarks.

          "description": "Transformer models have recently attracted much interest from computer vision\nresearchers and have since been successfully employed for several problems\ntraditionally addressed with convolutional neural networks. At the same time,\nimage synthesis using generative adversarial networks (GANs) has drastically\nimproved over the last few years. The recently proposed TransGAN is the first\nGAN using only transformer-based architectures and achieves competitive results\nwhen compared to convolutional GANs. However, since transformers are\ndata-hungry architectures, TransGAN requires data augmentation, an auxiliary\nsuper-resolution task during training, and a masking prior to guide the\nself-attention mechanism. In this paper, we study the combination of a\ntransformer-based generator and convolutional discriminator and successfully\nremove the need of the aforementioned required design choices. We evaluate our\napproach by conducting a benchmark of well-known CNN discriminators, ablate the\nsize of the transformer-based generator, and show that combining both\narchitectural elements into a hybrid model leads to better results.\nFurthermore, we investigate the frequency spectrum properties of generated\nimages and observe that our model retains the benefits of an attention based\ngenerator.",

The covariance matrix of this latent variable, models the aleatoric\nuncertainty due to label noise. We demonstrate that the learned covariance\nstructure captures known sources of label noise between semantically similar\nand co-occurring classes.

          "description": "Face recognition has achieved significant progress in deep-learning era due\nto the ultra-large-scale and well-labeled datasets. However, training on\nultra-large-scale datasets is time-consuming and takes up a lot of hardware\nresource. Therefore, how to design an appropriate training approach is very\ncrucial and indispensable. The computational and hardware cost of training\nultra-large-scale datasets mainly focuses on the Fully-Connected (FC) layer\nrather than convolutional layers. To this end, we propose a novel training\napproach for ultra-large-scale face datasets, termed Faster Face Classification\n(F$^2$C). In F$^2$C, we first define a Gallery Net and a Probe Net that are\nused to generate identities' centers and extract faces' features for face\nrecognition, respectively. Gallery Net has the same structure as Probe Net and\ninherits the parameters from Probe Net with a moving average paradigm. After\nthat, to reduce the training time and hardware resource occupancy of the FC\nlayer, we propose the Dynamic Class Pool that stores the features from Gallery\nNet and calculates the inner product (logits) with positive samples (its\nidentities appear in Dynamic Class Pool) in each mini-batch. Dynamic Class Pool\ncan be regarded as a substitute for the FC layer and its size is much smaller\nthan FC, which is the reason why Dynamic Class Pool can largely reduce the time\nand resource cost. For negative samples (its identities are not appear in the\nDynamic Class Pool), we minimize the cosine similarities between negative\nsamples and Dynamic Class Pool. Then, to improve the update efficiency and\nspeed of Dynamic Class Pool's parameters, we design the Dual Loaders including\nIdentity-based and Instance-based Loaders. Dual Loaders load images from given\ndataset by instances and identities to generate batches for training.",

This approach allows to overcome the inherent\nscarcity of pediatric data while benefiting from a more robust shared\nrepresentation. The proposed segmentation network comprises shared\nconvolutional filters, domain-specific batch normalization parameters that\ncompute the respective dataset statistics and a domain-specific segmentation\nlayer. Furthermore, a supervised contrastive regularization is integrated to\nfurther improve generalization capabilities, by promoting intra-domain\nsimilarity and impose inter-domain margins in embedded space.

          "description": "Recently, text detection has attracted sufficient attention in the field of\ncomputer vision and artificial intelligence. Among the existing approaches,\nregression-based models are limited to handle the texts with arbitrary shapes,\nwhile segmentation-based algorithms have high computational costs and suffer\nfrom the text adhesion problem. In this paper, we propose a new one-stage text\ndetector, termed as Bold Outline Text Detector (BOTD), which is able to process\nthe arbitrary-shaped text with low model complexity. Different from previous\nworks, BOTD utilizes the Polar Minimum Distance (PMD) to encode the shortest\ndistance between the center point and the contour of the text instance, and\ngenerates a Center Mask (CM) for each text instance. After learning the PMD\nheat map and CM map, the final results can be obtained with a simple Text\nReconstruction Module (TRM). Since the CM resides within the text box exactly,\nthe text adhesion problem is avoided naturally. Meanwhile, all the points on\nthe text contour share the same PMD, so the complexity of BOTD is much lower\nthan existing segmentation-based methods. Experimental results on three\nreal-world benchmarks show the state-of-the-art performance of BOTD.",

          "description": "Ordinal embedding aims at finding a low dimensional representation of objects\nfrom a set of constraints of the form \"item $j$ is closer to item $i$ than item\n$k$\". Typically, each object is mapped onto a point vector in a low dimensional\nmetric space. We argue that mapping to a density instead of a point vector\nprovides some interesting advantages, including an inherent reflection of the\nuncertainty about the representation itself and its relative location in the\nspace. Indeed, in this paper, we propose to embed each object as a Gaussian\ndistribution. We investigate the ability of these embeddings to capture the\nunderlying structure of the data while satisfying the constraints, and explore\nproperties of the representation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world\ndatasets showcase the advantages of our approach. In addition, we illustrate\nthe merit of modelling uncertainty, which enriches the visual perception of the\nmapped objects in the space.",

          "description": "Large-scale unlabeled data has allowed recent progress in self-supervised\nlearning methods that learn rich visual representations. State-of-the-art\nself-supervised methods for learning representations from images (MoCo and\nBYOL) use an inductive bias that different augmentations (e.g. random crops) of\nan image should produce similar embeddings. We show that such methods are\nvulnerable to backdoor attacks where an attacker poisons a part of the\nunlabeled data by adding a small trigger (known to the attacker) to the images.\nThe model performance is good on clean test images but the attacker can\nmanipulate the decision of the model by showing the trigger at test time.\nBackdoor attacks have been studied extensively in supervised learning and to\nthe best of our knowledge, we are the first to study them for self-supervised\nlearning. Backdoor attacks are more practical in self-supervised learning since\nthe unlabeled data is large and as a result, an inspection of the data to avoid\nthe presence of poisoned data is prohibitive. We show that in our targeted\nattack, the attacker can produce many false positives for the target category\nby using the trigger at test time. We also propose a knowledge distillation\nbased defense algorithm that succeeds in neutralizing the attack. Our code is\navailable here: https://github.com/UMBCvision/SSL-Backdoor .",

We first identify\nsequences of images with a minimum variation that are most suitable to share\nthe same or similar annotation using an unsupervised approach.

          "description": "This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing the surface shape of\ntransparent objects. The difficulty of this problem originates from the\nviewpoint dependent appearance of a transparent object, which quickly makes\nreconstruction methods tailored for diffuse surfaces fail disgracefully. In\nthis paper, we introduce a fixed viewpoint approach to dense surface\nreconstruction of transparent objects based on refraction of light. We present\na simple setup that allows us to alter the incident light paths before light\nrays enter the object by immersing the object partially in a liquid, and\ndevelop a method for recovering the object surface through reconstructing and\ntriangulating such incident light paths. Our proposed approach does not need to\nmodel the complex interactions of light as it travels through the object,\nneither does it assume any parametric form for the object shape nor the exact\nnumber of refractions and reflections taken place along the light paths. It can\ntherefore handle transparent objects with a relatively complex shape and\nstructure, with unknown and inhomogeneous refractive index. We also show that\nfor thin transparent objects, our proposed acquisition setup can be further\nsimplified by adopting a single refraction approximation. Experimental results\non both synthetic and real data demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our\nproposed approach.",

In this task, given a series of natural language captions\nwhich compose a story, an agent must generate a sequence of images that\ncorrespond to the captions. Prior work has introduced recurrent generative\nmodels which outperform text-to-image synthesis models on this task. However,\nthere is room for improvement of generated images in terms of visual quality,\ncoherence and relevance. We present a number of improvements to prior modeling\napproaches, including (1) the addition of a dual learning framework that\nutilizes video captioning to reinforce the semantic alignment between the story\nand generated images, (2) a copy-transform mechanism for\nsequentially-consistent story visualization, and (3) MART-based transformers to\nmodel complex interactions between frames. We present ablation studies to\ndemonstrate the effect of each of these techniques on the generative power of\nthe model for both individual images as well as the entire narrative.\nFurthermore, due to the complexity and generative nature of the task, standard\nevaluation metrics do not accurately reflect performance. Therefore, we also\nprovide an exploration of evaluation metrics for the model, focused on aspects\nof the generated frames such as the presence/quality of generated characters,\nthe relevance to captions, and the diversity of the generated images.

          "description": "Over the last few decades, Lung Ultrasound (LUS) has been increasingly used\nto diagnose and monitor different lung diseases in neonates. It is a non\ninvasive tool that allows a fast bedside examination while minimally handling\nthe neonate. Acquiring a LUS scan is easy, but understanding the artifacts\nconcerned with each respiratory disease is challenging. Mixed artifact patterns\nfound in different respiratory diseases may limit LUS readability by the\noperator. While machine learning (ML), especially deep learning can assist in\nautomated analysis, simply feeding the ultrasound images to an ML model for\ndiagnosis is not enough to earn the trust of medical professionals. The\nalgorithm should output LUS features that are familiar to the operator instead.\nTherefore, in this paper we present a unique approach for extracting seven\nmeaningful LUS features that can be easily associated with a specific\npathological lung condition: Normal pleura, irregular pleura, thick pleura,\nAlines, Coalescent B-lines, Separate B-lines and Consolidations. These\nartifacts can lead to early prediction of infants developing later respiratory\ndistress symptoms. A single multi-class region proposal-based object detection\nmodel faster-RCNN (fRCNN) was trained on lower posterior lung ultrasound videos\nto detect these LUS features which are further linked to four common neonatal\ndiseases. Our results show that fRCNN surpasses single stage models such as\nRetinaNet and can successfully detect the aforementioned LUS features with a\nmean average precision of 86.4%. Instead of a fully automatic diagnosis from\nimages without any interpretability, detection of such LUS features leave the\nultimate control of diagnosis to the clinician, which can result in a more\ntrustworthy intelligent system.",

Since existing\ndatasets and well-trained models are primarily unimodal, the modality gap\nbetween a unimodal network and unlabeled multimodal data poses an interesting\nproblem: how to transfer a pre-trained unimodal network to perform the same\ntask on unlabeled multimodal data? In this work, we propose multimodal\nknowledge expansion (MKE), a knowledge distillation-based framework to\neffectively utilize multimodal data without requiring labels. Opposite to\ntraditional knowledge distillation, where the student is designed to be\nlightweight and inferior to the teacher, we observe that a multimodal student\nmodel consistently denoises pseudo labels and generalizes better than its\nteacher. Extensive experiments on four tasks and different modalities verify\nthis finding. Furthermore, we connect the mechanism of MKE to semi-supervised\nlearning and offer both empirical and theoretical explanations to understand\nthe denoising capability of a multimodal student.",

However, frame-by-frame 3D\nobject detection suffers from noise, field-of-view obstruction, and sparsity.\nWe propose a novel Temporal Fusion Module (TFM) to use information from\nprevious time-steps to mitigate these problems. First, a state-of-the-art\nfrustum network extracts point cloud features from raw RGB and LiDAR point\ncloud data frame-by-frame. Then, our TFM module fuses these features with a\nrecurrent neural network. As a result, 3D object detection becomes robust\nagainst single frame failures and transient occlusions. Experiments on the\nKITTI object tracking dataset show the efficiency of the proposed TFM, where we\nobtain ~6%, ~4%, and ~6% improvements on Car, Pedestrian, and Cyclist classes,\nrespectively, compared to frame-by-frame baselines.

Nowadays, the power of deep learning is being utilized\nfor automatic feature learning from data in the field of biomedical image\nanalysis.

A joint supervised learning for\nSiamese network and unsupervised learning for Autoencoder is performed.\nMoreover, the Encoder network of Autoencoder is shared with Siamese network and\nreferred as the Siamcoder network.

One of\nthe most promising methods to estimate the harvest is berry counting, as it can\nbe approached non-destructively, and its process can be automated. In this\narticle, we present a method that addresses the challenge of occluded berries\nwith leaves to obtain a more accurate estimate of the number of berries that\nwill enable a better estimate of the harvest. We use generative adversarial\nnetworks, a deep learning-based approach that generates a likely scenario\nbehind the leaves exploiting learned patterns from images with non-occluded\nberries. Our experiments show that the estimate of the number of berries after\napplying our method is closer to the manually counted reference. In contrast to\napplying a factor to the berry count, our approach better adapts to local\nconditions by directly involving the appearance of the visible berries.\nFurthermore, we show that our approach can identify which areas in the image\nshould be changed by adding new berries without explicitly requiring\ninformation about hidden areas.",

          "description": "Capillaries are the smallest vessels in the body responsible for the delivery\nof oxygen and nutrients to the surrounding cells. Various diseases have been\nshown to alter the density of nutritive capillaries and the flow velocity of\nerythrocytes. In previous studies, capillary density and flow velocity have\nbeen assessed manually by trained specialists. Manual analysis of a 20-second\nlong microvascular video takes on average 20 minutes and requires extensive\ntraining. Several studies have reported that manual analysis hinders the\napplication of microvascular microscopy in a clinical setting. In this paper,\nwe present a fully automated system, called CapillaryNet, that can automate\nmicrovascular microscopy analysis so it can be used as a clinical application.\nMoreover, CapillaryNet measures several microvascular parameters that\nresearchers were previously unable to quantify, i.e. capillary hematocrit and\nintra-capillary flow velocity heterogeneity.",

          "description": "Object detection can be regarded as a pixel clustering task, and its boundary\nis determined by four extreme points (leftmost, top, rightmost, and bottom).\nHowever, most studies focus on the center or corner points of the object, which\nare actually conditional results of the extreme points. In this paper, we\npresent an Extreme-Point-Prediction-Based object detector (EPP-Net), which\ndirectly regresses the relative displacement vector between each pixel and the\nfour extreme points. We also propose a new metric to measure the similarity\nbetween two groups of extreme points, namely, Extreme Intersection over Union\n(EIoU), and incorporate this EIoU as a new regression loss. Moreover, we\npropose a novel branch to predict the EIoU between the ground-truth and the\nprediction results, and combine it with the classification confidence as the\nranking keyword in non-maximum suppression. On the MS-COCO dataset, our method\nachieves an average precision (AP) of 44.0% with ResNet-50 and an AP of 48.3%\nwith ResNeXt-101-DCN.

          "description": "As climate change increases the intensity of natural disasters, society needs\nbetter tools for adaptation. Floods, for example, are the most frequent natural\ndisaster, and better tools for flood risk communication could increase the\nsupport for flood-resilient infrastructure development. Our work aims to enable\nmore visual communication of large-scale climate impacts via visualizing the\noutput of coastal flood models as satellite imagery. We propose the first deep\nlearning pipeline to ensure physical-consistency in synthetic visual satellite\nimagery. We advanced a state-of-the-art GAN called pix2pixHD, such that it\nproduces imagery that is physically-consistent with the output of an\nexpert-validated storm surge model (NOAA SLOSH). By evaluating the imagery\nrelative to physics-based flood maps, we find that our proposed framework\noutperforms baseline models in both physical-consistency and photorealism. We\nenvision our work to be the first step towards a global visualization of how\nclimate change shapes our landscape. Continuing on this path, we show that the\nproposed pipeline generalizes to visualize arctic sea ice melt.

          "description": "Bone mineral density (BMD) is a clinically critical indicator of\nosteoporosis, usually measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Due\nto the limited accessibility of DEXA machines and examinations, osteoporosis is\noften under-diagnosed and under-treated, leading to increased fragility\nfracture risks. Thus it is highly desirable to obtain BMDs with alternative\ncost-effective and more accessible medical imaging examinations such as X-ray\nplain films. In this work, we formulate the BMD estimation from plain hip X-ray\nimages as a regression problem. Specifically, we propose a new semi-supervised\nself-training algorithm to train the BMD regression model using images coupled\nwith DEXA measured BMDs and unlabeled images with pseudo BMDs. Pseudo BMDs are\ngenerated and refined iteratively for unlabeled images during self-training. We\nalso present a novel adaptive triplet loss to improve the model's regression\naccuracy. On an in-house dataset of 1,090 images (819 unique patients), our BMD\nestimation method achieves a high Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8805 to\nground-truth BMDs. It offers good feasibility to use the more accessible and\ncheaper X-ray imaging for opportunistic osteoporosis screening.",

          "description": "Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has demonstrated great potential in\nquantifying tissue susceptibility in various brain diseases. However, the\nintrinsic ill-posed inverse problem relating the tissue phase to the underlying\nsusceptibility distribution affects the accuracy for quantifying tissue\nsusceptibility. Recently, deep learning has shown promising results to improve\naccuracy by reducing the streaking artifacts. However, there exists a mismatch\nbetween the observed phase and the theoretical forward phase estimated by the\nsusceptibility label. In this study, we proposed a model-based deep learning\narchitecture that followed the STI (susceptibility tensor imaging) physical\nmodel, referred to as MoDL-QSM. Specifically, MoDL-QSM accounts for the\nrelationship between STI-derived phase contrast induced by the susceptibility\ntensor terms (ki13,ki23,ki33) and the acquired single-orientation phase. The\nconvolution neural networks are embedded into the physical model to learn a\nregularization term containing prior information. ki33 and phase induced by\nki13 and ki23 terms were used as the labels for network training. Quantitative\nevaluation metrics (RSME, SSIM, and HFEN) were compared with recently developed\ndeep learning QSM methods. The results showed that MoDL-QSM achieved superior\nperformance, demonstrating its potential for future applications.",

We assume that the input of our system are two\nsequences of past skeletons for two interacting persons, and we aim to predict\nthe future motion for each of them. For this purpose, we devise a novel cross\ninteraction attention mechanism that exploits historical information of both\npersons and learns to predict cross dependencies between self poses and the\nposes of the other person in spite of their spatial or temporal distance. Since\nno dataset to train such interactive situations is available, we have captured\nExPI (Extreme Pose Interaction), a new lab-based person interaction dataset of\nprofessional dancers performing acrobatics. ExPI contains 115 sequences with\n30k frames and 60k instances with annotated 3D body poses and shapes. We\nthoroughly evaluate our cross-interaction network on this dataset and show that\nboth in short-term and long-term predictions, it consistently outperforms\nbaselines that independently reason for each person.

Most work to date assessing\ndisease severity on chest imaging has focused on segmenting computed tomography\n(CT) images; however, given that CTs are performed much less frequently than\nchest X-rays for COVID-19 patients, automated lung lesion segmentation on chest\nX-rays could be clinically valuable. There currently exists a universal\nshortage of chest X-rays with ground truth COVID-19 lung lesion annotations,\nand manually contouring lung opacities is a tedious, labor-intensive task. To\naccelerate severity detection and augment the amount of publicly available\nchest X-ray training data for supervised deep learning (DL) models, we leverage\nexisting annotated CT images to generate frontal projection \"chest X-ray\"\nimages for training COVID-19 chest X-ray models.

          "description": "Despite previous success in generating audio-driven talking heads, most of\nthe previous studies focus on the correlation between speech content and the\nmouth shape. Facial emotion, which is one of the most important features on\nnatural human faces, is always neglected in their methods. In this work, we\npresent Emotional Video Portraits (EVP), a system for synthesizing high-quality\nvideo portraits with vivid emotional dynamics driven by audios. Specifically,\nwe propose the Cross-Reconstructed Emotion Disentanglement technique to\ndecompose speech into two decoupled spaces, i.e., a duration-independent\nemotion space and a duration dependent content space. With the disentangled\nfeatures, dynamic 2D emotional facial landmarks can be deduced. Then we propose\nthe Target-Adaptive Face Synthesis technique to generate the final high-quality\nvideo portraits, by bridging the gap between the deduced landmarks and the\nnatural head poses of target videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

          "description": "Object recognition in unseen indoor environments remains a challenging\nproblem for visual perception of mobile robots. In this letter, we propose the\nuse of topologically persistent features, which rely on the objects' shape\ninformation, to address this challenge. In particular, we extract two kinds of\nfeatures, namely, sparse persistence image (PI) and amplitude, by applying\npersistent homology to multi-directional height function-based filtrations of\nthe cubical complexes representing the object segmentation maps. The features\nare then used to train a fully connected network for recognition. For\nperformance evaluation, in addition to a widely used shape dataset and a\nbenchmark indoor scenes dataset, we collect a new dataset, comprising scene\nimages from two different environments, namely, a living room and a mock\nwarehouse. The scenes are captured using varying camera poses under different\nillumination conditions and include up to five different objects from a given\nset of fourteen objects. On the benchmark indoor scenes dataset, sparse PI\nfeatures show better recognition performance in unseen environments than the\nfeatures learned using the widely used ResNetV2-56 and EfficientNet-B4 models.\nFurther, they provide slightly higher recall and accuracy values than Faster\nR-CNN, an end-to-end object detection method, and its state-of-the-art variant,\nDomain Adaptive Faster R-CNN. The performance of our methods also remains\nrelatively unchanged from the training environment (living room) to the unseen\nenvironment (mock warehouse) in the new dataset. In contrast, the performance\nof the object detection methods drops substantially. We also implement the\nproposed method on a real-world robot to demonstrate its usefulness.",

          "description": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been attached great importance due to\ntheir biological plausibility and high energy-efficiency on neuromorphic chips.\nAs these chips are usually resource-constrained, the compression of SNNs is\nthus crucial along the road of practical use of SNNs. Most existing methods\ndirectly apply pruning approaches in artificial neural networks (ANNs) to SNNs,\nwhich ignore the difference between ANNs and SNNs, thus limiting the\nperformance of the pruned SNNs. Besides, these methods are only suitable for\nshallow SNNs. In this paper, inspired by synaptogenesis and synapse elimination\nin the neural system, we propose gradient rewiring (Grad R), a joint learning\nalgorithm of connectivity and weight for SNNs, that enables us to seamlessly\noptimize network structure without retrain. Our key innovation is to redefine\nthe gradient to a new synaptic parameter, allowing better exploration of\nnetwork structures by taking full advantage of the competition between pruning\nand regrowth of connections. The experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod achieves minimal loss of SNNs' performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset\nso far. Moreover, it reaches a $\\sim$3.5% accuracy loss under unprecedented\n0.73% connectivity, which reveals remarkable structure refining capability in\nSNNs. Our work suggests that there exists extremely high redundancy in deep\nSNNs. Our codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/Yanqi-Chen/Gradient-Rewiring .",

          "description": "Improving irradiance forecasting is critical to further increase the share of\nsolar in the energy mix. On a short time scale, fish-eye cameras on the ground\nare used to capture cloud displacements causing the local variability of the\nelectricity production. As most of the solar radiation comes directly from the\nSun, current forecasting approaches use its position in the image as a\nreference to interpret the cloud cover dynamics. However, existing Sun tracking\nmethods rely on external data and a calibration of the camera, which requires\naccess to the device. To address these limitations, this study introduces an\nimage-based Sun tracking algorithm to localise the Sun in the image when it is\nvisible and interpolate its daily trajectory from past observations. We\nvalidate the method on a set of sky images collected over a year at SIRTA's\nlab.

          "description": "Policies trained in simulation often fail when transferred to the real world\ndue to the `reality gap' where the simulator is unable to accurately capture\nthe dynamics and visual properties of the real world. Current approaches to\ntackle this problem, such as domain randomization, require prior knowledge and\nengineering to determine how much to randomize system parameters in order to\nlearn a policy that is robust to sim-to-real transfer while also not being too\nconservative. We propose a method for automatically tuning simulator system\nparameters to match the real world using only raw RGB images of the real world\nwithout the need to define rewards or estimate state. Our key insight is to\nreframe the auto-tuning of parameters as a search problem where we iteratively\nshift the simulation system parameters to approach the real-world system\nparameters. We propose a Search Param Model (SPM) that, given a sequence of\nobservations and actions and a set of system parameters, predicts whether the\ngiven parameters are higher or lower than the true parameters used to generate\nthe observations. We evaluate our method on multiple robotic control tasks in\nboth sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfer, demonstrating significant improvement\nover naive domain randomization.

          "description": "Advances in the motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)\nallow control of several applications by decoding neurophysiological phenomena,\nwhich are usually recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) using a non-invasive\ntechnique. Despite great advances in MI-based BCI, EEG rhythms are specific to\na subject and various changes over time. These issues point to significant\nchallenges to enhance the classification performance, especially in a\nsubject-independent manner. To overcome these challenges, we propose MIN2Net, a\nnovel end-to-end multi-task learning to tackle this task. We integrate deep\nmetric learning into a multi-task autoencoder to learn a compact and\ndiscriminative latent representation from EEG and perform classification\nsimultaneously. This approach reduces the complexity in pre-processing, results\nin significant performance improvement on EEG classification. Experimental\nresults in a subject-independent manner show that MIN2Net outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art techniques, achieving an F1-score improvement of 6.72%, and\n2.23% on the SMR-BCI, and OpenBMI datasets, respectively. We demonstrate that\nMIN2Net improves discriminative information in the latent representation. This\nstudy indicates the possibility and practicality of using this model to develop\nMI-based BCI applications for new users without the need for calibration.",

In this paper, we\naim at designing efficient architecture for 8-bit quantization and deploy it on\nmobile device. First, we conduct an experiment about meta-node latency by\ndecomposing lightweight SR architectures, which determines the portable\noperations we can utilize.

While LiDAR sensors\nprovide reliably accurate information, existing end-to-end driving solutions\nare mainly based on cameras since processing 3D data requires a large memory\nfootprint and computation cost. On the other hand, increasing the robustness of\nthese systems is also critical; however, even estimating the model's\nuncertainty is very challenging due to the cost of sampling-based methods. In\nthis paper, we present an efficient and robust LiDAR-based end-to-end\nnavigation framework. We first introduce Fast-LiDARNet that is based on sparse\nconvolution kernel optimization and hardware-aware model design. We then\npropose Hybrid Evidential Fusion that directly estimates the uncertainty of the\nprediction from only a single forward pass and then fuses the control\npredictions intelligently. We evaluate our system on a full-scale vehicle and\ndemonstrate lane-stable as well as navigation capabilities. In the presence of\nout-of-distribution events (e.g., sensor failures), our system significantly\nimproves robustness and reduces the number of takeovers in the real world.",

          "description": "For over 40 years lithographic silicon scaling has driven circuit integration\nand performance improvement in the semiconductor industry. As silicon scaling\nslows down, the industry is increasingly dependent on IC package technologies\nto contribute to further circuit integration and performance improvements. This\nis a paradigm shift and requires the IC package industry to reduce the size and\nincrease the density of internal interconnects on a scale which has never been\ndone before. Traditional package characterization and process optimization\nrelies on destructive techniques such as physical cross-sections and delayering\nto extract data from internal package features. These destructive techniques\nare not practical with today's advanced packages. In this paper we will\ndemonstrate how data acquired non-destructively with a 3D X-ray microscope can\nbe enhanced and optimized using machine learning, and can then be used to\nmeasure, characterize and optimize the design and production of buried\ninterconnects in advanced IC packages. Test vehicles replicating 2.5D and HBM\nconstruction were designed and fabricated, and digital data was extracted from\nthese test vehicles using 3D X-ray and machine learning techniques. The\nextracted digital data was used to characterize and optimize the design and\nproduction of the interconnects and demonstrates a superior alternative to\ndestructive physical analysis. We report an mAP of 0.96 for 3D object\ndetection, a dice score of 0.92 for 3D segmentation, and an average of 2.1um\nerror for 3D metrology on the test dataset.

This is the reason why forecasting pedestrians' intentions\nsufficiently in advance is one of the most critical and challenging tasks for\nautonomous vehicles. This work tries to solve this problem by jointly\npredicting the intention and visual states of pedestrians. In terms of visual\nstates, whereas previous work focused on x-y coordinates, we will also predict\nthe size and indeed the whole bounding box of the pedestrian. The method is a\nrecurrent neural network in a multi-task learning approach. It has one head\nthat predicts the intention of the pedestrian for each one of its future\nposition and another one predicting the visual states of the pedestrian.\nExperiments on the JAAD dataset show the superiority of the performance of our\nmethod compared to previous works for intention prediction. Also, although its\nsimple architecture (more than 2 times faster), the performance of the bounding\nbox prediction is comparable to the ones yielded by much more complex\narchitectures.

Previous methods focus on the narrower\ntask of face-clustering, and for the most part ignore other cues such as the\nperson's voice, their overall appearance (hair, clothes, posture), and the\nediting structure of the videos. Similarly, most current datasets evaluate only\nthe task of face-clustering, rather than person-clustering. This limits their\napplicability to downstream applications such as story understanding which\nrequire person-level, rather than only face-level, reasoning. In this paper we\nmake contributions to address both these deficiencies: first, we introduce a\nMulti-Modal High-Precision Clustering algorithm for person-clustering in videos\nusing cues from several modalities (face, body, and voice). Second, we\nintroduce a Video Person-Clustering dataset, for evaluating multi-modal\nperson-clustering. It contains body-tracks for each annotated character,\nface-tracks when visible, and voice-tracks when speaking, with their associated\nfeatures. The dataset is by far the largest of its kind, and covers films and\nTV-shows representing a wide range of demographics. Finally, we show the\neffectiveness of using multiple modalities for person-clustering, explore the\nuse of this new broad task for story understanding through character\nco-occurrences, and achieve a new state of the art on all available datasets\nfor face and person-clustering.",

The methods\ndeveloped up to now measure urban morphology with numerical indices describing\ndensity, proportion, and mixture, but they do not directly represent\nmorphological features from human's visual and intuitive perspective. We take\nthe first step to bridge the gap by proposing a deep learning-based technique\nto automatically classify road networks into four classes on a visual basis.\nThe method is implemented by generating an image of the street network (Colored\nRoad Hierarchy Diagram), which we introduce in this paper, and classifying it\nusing a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-34). The model achieves an\noverall classification accuracy of 0.875. Nine cities around the world are\nselected as the study areas and their road networks are acquired from\nOpenStreetMap. Latent subgroups among the cities are uncovered through a\nclustering on the percentage of each road network category. In the subsequent\npart of the paper, we focus on the usability of such classification: the\neffectiveness of our human perception augmentation is examined by a case study\nof urban vitality prediction. An advanced tree-based regression model is for\nthe first time designated to establish the relationship between morphological\nindices and vitality indicators.

          "description": "Following the recent initiatives for the democratization of AI, deep fake\ngenerators have become increasingly popular and accessible, causing dystopian\nscenarios towards social erosion of trust. A particular domain, such as\nbiological signals, attracted attention towards detection methods that are\ncapable of exploiting authenticity signatures in real videos that are not yet\nfaked by generative approaches. In this paper, we first propose several\nprominent eye and gaze features that deep fakes exhibit differently. Second, we\ncompile those features into signatures and analyze and compare those of real\nand fake videos, formulating geometric, visual, metric, temporal, and spectral\nvariations. Third, we generalize this formulation to the deep fake detection\nproblem by a deep neural network, to classify any video in the wild as fake or\nreal. We evaluate our approach on several deep fake datasets, achieving 92.48%\naccuracy on FaceForensics++, 80.0% on Deep Fakes (in the wild), 88.35% on\nCelebDF, and 99.27% on DeeperForensics datasets. Our approach outperforms most\ndeep and biological fake detectors with complex network architectures without\nthe proposed gaze signatures. We conduct ablation studies involving different\nfeatures, architectures, sequence durations, and post-processing artifacts.",

          "description": "The technology for Visual Odometry (VO) that estimates the position and\norientation of the moving object through analyzing the image sequences captured\nby on-board cameras, has been well investigated with the rising interest in\nautonomous driving. This paper studies monocular VO from the perspective of\nDeep Learning (DL). Unlike most current learning-based methods, our approach,\ncalled DeepAVO, is established on the intuition that features contribute\ndiscriminately to different motion patterns. Specifically, we present a novel\nfour-branch network to learn the rotation and translation by leveraging\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to focus on different quadrants of optical\nflow input. To enhance the ability of feature selection, we further introduce\nan effective channel-spatial attention mechanism to force each branch to\nexplicitly distill related information for specific Frame to Frame (F2F) motion\nestimation. Experiments on various datasets involving outdoor driving and\nindoor walking scenarios show that the proposed DeepAVO outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art monocular methods by a large margin, demonstrating competitive\nperformance to the stereo VO algorithm and verifying promising potential for\ngeneralization.",

          "description": "In the image classification task, the most common approach is to resize all\nimages in a dataset to a unique shape, while reducing their precision to a size\nwhich facilitates experimentation at scale. This practice has benefits from a\ncomputational perspective, but it entails negative side-effects on performance\ndue to loss of information and image deformation. In this work we introduce the\nMAMe dataset, an image classification dataset with remarkable high resolution\nand variable shape properties. The goal of MAMe is to provide a tool for\nstudying the impact of such properties in image classification, while\nmotivating research in the field. The MAMe dataset contains thousands of\nartworks from three different museums, and proposes a classification task\nconsisting on differentiating between 29 mediums (i.e. materials and\ntechniques) supervised by art experts. After reviewing the singularity of MAMe\nin the context of current image classification tasks, a thorough description of\nthe task is provided, together with dataset statistics. Experiments are\nconducted to evaluate the impact of using high resolution images, variable\nshape inputs and both properties at the same time. Results illustrate the\npositive impact in performance when using high resolution images, while\nhighlighting the lack of solutions to exploit variable shapes. An additional\nexperiment exposes the distinctiveness between the MAMe dataset and the\nprototypical ImageNet dataset. Finally, the baselines are inspected using\nexplainability methods and expert knowledge, to gain insights on the challenges\nthat remain ahead.",

          "description": "The absence or abnormality of fidgety movements of joints or limbs is\nstrongly indicative of cerebral palsy in infants. Developing computer-based\nmethods for assessing infant movements in videos is pivotal for improved\ncerebral palsy screening. Most existing methods use appearance-based features\nand are thus sensitive to strong but irrelevant signals caused by background\nclutter or a moving camera. Moreover, these features are computed over the\nwhole frame, thus they measure gross whole body movements rather than specific\njoint/limb motion.\n\nAddressing these challenges, we develop and validate a new method for fidgety\nmovement assessment from consumer-grade videos using human poses extracted from\nshort clips. Human poses capture only relevant motion profiles of joints and\nlimbs and are thus free from irrelevant appearance artifacts. The dynamics and\ncoordination between joints are modeled using spatio-temporal graph\nconvolutional networks. Frames and body parts that contain discriminative\ninformation about fidgety movements are selected through a spatio-temporal\nattention mechanism. We validate the proposed model on the cerebral palsy\nscreening task using a real-life consumer-grade video dataset collected at an\nAustralian hospital through the Cerebral Palsy Alliance, Australia. Our\nexperiments show that the proposed method achieves the ROC-AUC score of 81.87%,\nsignificantly outperforming existing competing methods with better\ninterpretability.",

          "description": "In real-world scenarios, many factors may harm face recognition performance,\ne.g., large pose, bad illumination,low resolution, blur and noise. To address\nthese challenges, previous efforts usually first restore the low-quality faces\nto high-quality ones and then perform face recognition. However, most of these\nmethods are stage-wise, which is sub-optimal and deviates from the reality. In\nthis paper, we address all these challenges jointly for unconstrained face\nrecognition. We propose an Multi-Degradation Face Restoration (MDFR) model to\nrestore frontalized high-quality faces from the given low-quality ones under\narbitrary facial poses, with three distinct novelties. First, MDFR is a\nwell-designed encoder-decoder architecture which extracts feature\nrepresentation from an input face image with arbitrary low-quality factors and\nrestores it to a high-quality counterpart. Second, MDFR introduces a pose\nresidual learning strategy along with a 3D-based Pose Normalization Module\n(PNM), which can perceive the pose gap between the input initial pose and its\nreal-frontal pose to guide the face frontalization. Finally, MDFR can generate\nfrontalized high-quality face images by a single unified network, showing a\nstrong capability of preserving face identity. Qualitative and quantitative\nexperiments on both controlled and in-the-wild benchmarks demonstrate the\nsuperiority of MDFR over state-of-the-art methods on both face frontalization\nand face restoration.",

We apply our topological score in three scenarios: i.\na U-net ii. a U-net pretrained on an autoencoder, and iii. a semisupervised\nU-net architecture, which offers a straightforward approach to jointly training\nthe network both as an autoencoder and a segmentation algorithm.

          "description": "Getting the distance to objects is crucial for autonomous vehicles. In\ninstances where depth sensors cannot be used, this distance has to be estimated\nfrom RGB cameras. As opposed to cars, the task of estimating depth from\non-board mounted cameras is made complex on drones because of the lack of\nconstrains on motion during flights. %In the case of drones, this task is even\nmore complex than for car-mounted cameras since the camera motion is\nunconstrained. In this paper, we present a method to estimate the distance of\nobjects seen by an on-board mounted camera by using its RGB video stream and\ndrone motion information. Our method is built upon a pyramidal convolutional\nneural network architecture and uses time recurrence in pair with geometric\nconstraints imposed by motion to produce pixel-wise depth maps. %from a RGB\nvideo stream of a camera attached to the drone In our architecture, each level\nof the pyramid is designed to produce its own depth estimate based on past\nobservations and information provided by the previous level in the pyramid.

          "description": "Existing multi-camera solutions for automatic scorekeeping in steel-tip darts\nare very expensive and thus inaccessible to most players. Motivated to develop\na more accessible low-cost solution, we present a new approach to keypoint\ndetection and apply it to predict dart scores from a single image taken from\nany camera angle. This problem involves detecting multiple keypoints that may\nbe of the same class and positioned in close proximity to one another. The\nwidely adopted framework for regressing keypoints using heatmaps is not\nwell-suited for this task. To address this issue, we instead propose to model\nkeypoints as objects. We develop a deep convolutional neural network around\nthis idea and use it to predict dart locations and dartboard calibration points\nwithin an overall pipeline for automatic dart scoring, which we call DeepDarts.\nAdditionally, we propose several task-specific data augmentation strategies to\nimprove the generalization of our method. As a proof of concept, two datasets\ncomprising 16k images originating from two different dartboard setups were\nmanually collected and annotated to evaluate the system. In the primary dataset\ncontaining 15k images captured from a face-on view of the dartboard using a\nsmartphone, DeepDarts predicted the total score correctly in 94.7% of the test\nimages. In a second more challenging dataset containing limited training data\n(830 images) and various camera angles, we utilize transfer learning and\nextensive data augmentation to achieve a test accuracy of 84.0%. Because\nDeepDarts relies only on single images, it has the potential to be deployed on\nedge devices, giving anyone with a smartphone access to an automatic dart\nscoring system for steel-tip darts.

As these APIs get deployed for high-stakes applications, it's very\nimportant that they are robust to different manipulations. Recent works have\nonly focused on typical adversarial attacks when evaluating the robustness of\nvision APIs. We propose two new aspects of adversarial image generation methods\nand evaluate them on the robustness of Google Cloud Vision API's optical\ncharacter recognition service and object detection APIs deployed in real-world\nsettings such as sightengine.com, picpurify.com, Google Cloud Vision API, and\nMicrosoft Azure's Computer Vision API.

These\nmethods are so straightforward that even non-specialists can craft such\nattacks. As a result, they pose a serious threat where APIs are used for\nhigh-stakes applications. Our transparent adversarial examples successfully\nevade state-of-the art object detections APIs such as Azure Cloud Vision\n(attack success rate 52%) and Google Cloud Vision (attack success rate 36%).\n90% of the images have a secret embedded text that successfully fools the\nvision of time-limited humans but is detected by Google Cloud Vision API's\noptical character recognition.

As a result,\nthere is a huge demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based quick disease\ndiagnosis methods as an alternative to high demand tests such as Polymerase\nChain Reaction (PCR). Chest X-ray (CXR) Image analysis is such cost-effective\nradiography technique due to resource availability and quick screening. But, a\nsufficient and systematic data collection that is required by complex deep\nleaning (DL) models is more difficult and hence there are recent efforts that\nutilize transfer learning to address this issue. Still these transfer learnt\nmodels suffer from lack of generalization and increased bias to the training\ndataset resulting poor performance for unseen data. Limited correlation of the\ntransferred features from the pre-trained model to a specific medical imaging\ndomain like X-ray and overfitting on fewer data can be reasons for this\ncircumstance. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Convolution Neural Network\n(GCN) that is capable of identifying bio-markers of Covid-19 pneumonia from CXR\nimages and meta information about patients. The proposed method exploits\nimportant relational knowledge between data instances and their features using\ngraph representation and applies convolution to learn the graph data which is\nnot possible with conventional convolution on Euclidean domain. The results of\nextensive experiments of proposed model on binary (Covid vs normal) and three\nclass (Covid, normal, other pneumonia) classification problems outperform\ndifferent benchmark transfer learnt models, hence overcoming the aforementioned\ndrawbacks.",

Methods: The approach in this study\nis: 1) we propose a data enhancement method to increase the diversity of the\ndata set, thereby improving the generalization performance of the model. 2) Our\ndeep convolution neural network model DPN-SE adds a self-attention mechanism to\nthe DPN network. The addition of a self-attention mechanism has greatly\nimproved the performance of the network. 3) Use the Lime interpretable library\nto mark the feature regions on the X-ray medical image that helps doctors more\nquickly diagnose COVID-19 in people. Results: Under the same network model, the\ndata with and without data enhancement is put into the model for training\nrespectively.

We propose that the accuracy and recall rates of the DPN-SE network\nare 93% and 98% of cases (COVID vs. pneumonia bacteria vs. viral pneumonia vs.\nnormal). Compared with the original DPN, the respective accuracy is improved by\n2%. Conclusion: The data augmentation method we used has achieved effective\nresults on a small amount of data set, showing that a reasonable data\naugmentation method can improve the recognition accuracy without changing the\nsample size and model structure. Overall, the proposed method and model can\neffectively become a very useful tool for clinical radiologists.",

          "description": "Learning based video compression attracts increasing attention in the past\nfew years. The previous hybrid coding approaches rely on pixel space operations\nto reduce spatial and temporal redundancy, which may suffer from inaccurate\nmotion estimation or less effective motion compensation. In this work, we\npropose a feature-space video coding network (FVC) by performing all major\noperations (i.e., motion estimation, motion compression, motion compensation\nand residual compression) in the feature space. Specifically, in the proposed\ndeformable compensation module, we first apply motion estimation in the feature\nspace to produce motion information (i.e., the offset maps), which will be\ncompressed by using the auto-encoder style network. Then we perform motion\ncompensation by using deformable convolution and generate the predicted\nfeature. After that, we compress the residual feature between the feature from\nthe current frame and the predicted feature from our deformable compensation\nmodule. For better frame reconstruction, the reference features from multiple\nprevious reconstructed frames are also fused by using the non-local attention\nmechanism in the multi-frame feature fusion module. Comprehensive experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance on four benchmark datasets including HEVC, UVG, VTL and MCL-JCV.",

          "description": "Recently, collaborative learning proposed by Song and Chai has achieved\nremarkable improvements in image classification tasks by simultaneously\ntraining multiple classifier heads. However, huge memory footprints required by\nsuch multi-head structures may hinder the training of large-capacity baseline\nmodels. The natural question is how to achieve collaborative learning within a\nsingle network without duplicating any modules. In this paper, we propose four\nways of collaborative learning among different parts of a single network with\nnegligible engineering efforts. To improve the robustness of the network, we\nleverage the consistency of the output layer and intermediate layers for\ntraining under the collaborative learning framework. Besides, the similarity of\nintermediate representation and convolution kernel is also introduced to reduce\nthe reduce redundant in a neural network. Compared to the method of Song and\nChai, our framework further considers the collaboration inside a single model\nand takes smaller overhead. Extensive experiments on Cifar-10, Cifar-100,\nImageNet32 and STL-10 corroborate the effectiveness of these four ways\nseparately while combining them leads to further improvements. In particular,\ntest errors on the STL-10 dataset are decreased by $9.28\\%$ and $5.45\\%$ for\nResNet-18 and VGG-16 respectively. Moreover, our method is proven to be robust\nto label noise with experiments on Cifar-10 dataset. For example, our method\nhas $3.53\\%$ higher performance under $50\\%$ noise ratio setting.",

VTNet is a highly effective\nstructure that embodies two key properties for visual representations: First,\nthe relationships among all the object instances in a scene are exploited;\nSecond, the spatial locations of objects and image regions are emphasized so\nthat directional navigation signals can be learned. Furthermore, we also\ndevelop a pre-training scheme to associate the visual representations with\nnavigation signals, and thus facilitate navigation policy learning.

Given such visual representations, agents are able to explore the\ncorrelations between visual observations and navigation actions.

          "description": "Joint relation modeling is a curial component in human motion prediction.\nMost existing methods tend to design skeletal-based graphs to build the\nrelations among joints, where local interactions between joint pairs are well\nlearned. However, the global coordination of all joints, which reflects human\nmotion's balance property, is usually weakened because it is learned from part\nto whole progressively and asynchronously. Thus, the final predicted motions\nare sometimes unnatural. To tackle this issue, we learn a medium, called\nbalance attractor (BA), from the spatiotemporal features of motion to\ncharacterize the global motion features, which is subsequently used to build\nnew joint relations. Through the BA, all joints are related synchronously, and\nthus the global coordination of all joints can be better learned. Based on the\nBA, we propose our framework, referred to Attractor-Guided Neural Network,\nmainly including Attractor-Based Joint Relation Extractor (AJRE) and\nMulti-timescale Dynamics Extractor (MTDE). The AJRE mainly includes Global\nCoordination Extractor (GCE) and Local Interaction Extractor (LIE).

          "description": "Registration networks have shown great application potentials in medical\nimage analysis. However, supervised training methods have a great demand for\nlarge and high-quality labeled datasets, which is time-consuming and sometimes\nimpractical due to data sharing issues. Unsupervised image registration\nalgorithms commonly employ intensity-based similarity measures as loss\nfunctions without any manual annotations. These methods estimate the\nparameterized transformations between pairs of moving and fixed images through\nthe optimization of the network parameters during training. However, these\nmethods become less effective when the image quality varies, e.g., some images\nare corrupted by substantial noise or artifacts. In this work, we propose a\nnovel approach based on a low-rank representation, i.e., Regnet-LRR, to tackle\nthe problem. We project noisy images into a noise-free low-rank space, and then\ncompute the similarity between the images. Based on the low-rank similarity\nmeasure, we train the registration network to predict the dense deformation\nfields of noisy image pairs. We highlight that the low-rank projection is\nreformulated in a way that the registration network can successfully update\ngradients. With two tasks, i.e., cardiac and abdominal intra-modality\nregistration, we demonstrate that the low-rank representation can boost the\ngeneralization ability and robustness of models as well as bring significant\nimprovements in noisy data registration scenarios.",

          "description": "Attention mechanisms have been widely applied to cross-modal tasks such as\nimage captioning and information retrieval, and have achieved remarkable\nimprovements due to its capability to learn fine-grained relevance across\ndifferent modalities. However, existing attention models could be sub-optimal\nand lack preciseness because there is no direct supervision involved during\ntraining. In this work, we propose Contrastive Content Re-sourcing (CCR) and\nContrastive Content Swapping (CCS) constraints to address such limitation.\nThese constraints supervise the training of attention models in a contrastive\nlearning manner without requiring explicit attention annotations. Additionally,\nwe introduce three metrics, namely Attention Precision, Recall and F1-Score, to\nquantitatively evaluate the attention quality. We evaluate the proposed\nconstraints with cross-modal retrieval (image-text matching) task. The\nexperiments on both Flickr30k and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate that integrating\nthese attention constraints into two state-of-the-art attention-based models\nimproves the model performance in terms of both retrieval accuracy and\nattention metrics.",

          "description": "Superpixels are higher-order perceptual groups of pixels in an image, often\ncarrying much more information than raw pixels. There is an inherent relational\nstructure to the relationship among different superpixels of an image. This\nrelational information can convey some form of domain information about the\nimage, e.g. relationship between superpixels representing two eyes in a cat\nimage. Our interest in this paper is to construct computer vision models,\nspecifically those based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to incorporate these\nsuperpixels information. We propose a methodology to construct a hybrid model\nthat leverages (a) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to deal with spatial\ninformation in an image, and (b) Graph Neural Network (GNN) to deal with\nrelational superpixel information in the image. The proposed deep model is\nlearned using a generic hybrid loss function that we call a `hybrid' loss. We\nevaluate the predictive performance of our proposed hybrid vision model on four\npopular image classification datasets: MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.\nMoreover, we evaluate our method on three real-world classification tasks:\nCOVID-19 X-Ray Detection, LFW Face Recognition, and SOCOFing Fingerprint\nIdentification.

          "description": "Recently, plenty of work has tried to introduce transformers into computer\nvision tasks, with good results. Unlike classic convolution networks, which\nextract features within a local receptive field, transformers can adaptively\naggregate similar features from a global view using self-attention mechanism.\nFor object detection, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) proposes feature\ninteraction across layers and proves its extremely importance. However, its\ninteraction is still in a local manner, which leaves a lot of room for\nimprovement. Since transformer was originally designed for NLP tasks, adapting\nprocessing subject directly from text to image will cause unaffordable\ncomputation and space overhead. In this paper, we utilize a linearized\nattention function to overcome above problems and build a novel architecture,\nnamed Content-Augmented Feature Pyramid Network (CA-FPN), which proposes a\nglobal content extraction module and deeply combines with FPN through light\nlinear transformers. What's more, light transformers can further make the\napplication of multi-head attention mechanism easier. Most importantly, our\nCA-FPN can be readily plugged into existing FPN-based models. Extensive\nexperiments on the challenging COCO object detection dataset demonstrated that\nour CA-FPN significantly outperforms competitive baselines without bells and\nwhistles.

To evaluate our model, we\nconduct extensive experiments on a newly collected egocentric video dataset, in\nwhich both human naturalistic actions and photo-realistic 3D environment\nreconstructions are captured.

The newly collected data\nusually consist of multiple modalities and characterized with multiple labels,\nthus exhibiting the co-existence of multiple types of heterogeneity. Although\nstate-of-the-art techniques are good at modeling the complex heterogeneity with\nsufficient label information, such label information can be quite expensive to\nobtain in real applications, leading to sub-optimal performance using these\ntechniques. Inspired by the capability of contrastive learning to utilize rich\nunlabeled data for improving performance, in this paper, we propose a unified\nheterogeneous learning framework, which combines both weighted unsupervised\ncontrastive loss and weighted supervised contrastive loss to model multiple\ntypes of heterogeneity. We also provide theoretical analyses showing that the\nproposed weighted supervised contrastive loss is the lower bound of the mutual\ninformation of two samples from the same class and the weighted unsupervised\ncontrastive loss is the lower bound of the mutual information between the\nhidden representation of two views of the same sample.

          "description": "Purpose: To develop an algorithm for robust partial Fourier (PF)\nreconstruction applicable to diffusion-weighted (DW) images with non-smooth\nphase variations.\n\nMethods: Based on an unrolled proximal splitting algorithm, a neural network\narchitecture is derived which alternates between data consistency operations\nand regularization implemented by recurrent convolutions. In order to exploit\ncorrelations, multiple repetitions of the same slice are jointly reconstructed\nunder consideration of permutation-equivariance. The proposed method is trained\non DW liver data of 60 volunteers and evaluated on retrospectively and\nprospectively sub-sampled data of different anatomies and resolutions. In\naddition, the benefits of using a recurrent network over other unrolling\nstrategies is investigated.\n\nResults: Conventional PF techniques can be significantly outperformed in\nterms of quantitative measures as well as perceptual image quality. The\nproposed method is able to generalize well to brain data with contrasts and\nresolution not present in the training set. The reduction in echo time (TE)\nassociated with prospective PF-sampling enables DW imaging with higher signal.\nAlso, the TE increase in acquisitions with higher resolution can be compensated\nfor. It can be shown that unrolling by means of a recurrent network produced\nbetter results than using a weight-shared network or a cascade of networks.\n\nConclusion: This work demonstrates that robust PF reconstruction of DW data\nis feasible even at strong PF factors in applications with severe phase\nvariations. Since the proposed method does not rely on smoothness priors of the\nphase but uses learned recurrent convolutions instead, artifacts of\nconventional PF methods can be avoided.",

          "description": "While imitation learning for vision based autonomous mobile robot navigation\nhas recently received a great deal of attention in the research community,\nexisting approaches typically require state action demonstrations that were\ngathered using the deployment platform. However, what if one cannot easily\noutfit their platform to record these demonstration signals or worse yet the\ndemonstrator does not have access to the platform at all? Is imitation learning\nfor vision based autonomous navigation even possible in such scenarios? In this\nwork, we hypothesize that the answer is yes and that recent ideas from the\nImitation from Observation (IfO) literature can be brought to bear such that a\nrobot can learn to navigate using only ego centric video collected by a\ndemonstrator, even in the presence of viewpoint mismatch. To this end, we\nintroduce a new algorithm, Visual Observation only Imitation Learning for\nAutonomous navigation (VOILA), that can successfully learn navigation policies\nfrom a single video demonstration collected from a physically different agent.\nWe evaluate VOILA in the photorealistic AirSim simulator and show that VOILA\nnot only successfully imitates the expert, but that it also learns navigation\npolicies that can generalize to novel environments. Further, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of VOILA in a real world setting by showing that it allows a\nwheeled Jackal robot to successfully imitate a human walking in an environment\nusing a video recorded using a mobile phone camera.",

          "description": "Despite the empirical success of neural architecture search (NAS) in deep\nlearning applications, the optimality, reproducibility and cost of NAS schemes\nremain hard to assess. In this paper, we propose Generative Adversarial NAS\n(GA-NAS) with theoretically provable convergence guarantees, promoting\nstability and reproducibility in neural architecture search. Inspired by\nimportance sampling, GA-NAS iteratively fits a generator to previously\ndiscovered top architectures, thus increasingly focusing on important parts of\na large search space. Furthermore, we propose an efficient adversarial learning\napproach, where the generator is trained by reinforcement learning based on\nrewards provided by a discriminator, thus being able to explore the search\nspace without evaluating a large number of architectures. Extensive experiments\nshow that GA-NAS beats the best published results under several cases on three\npublic NAS benchmarks. In the meantime, GA-NAS can handle ad-hoc search\nconstraints and search spaces. We show that GA-NAS can be used to improve\nalready optimized baselines found by other NAS methods, including EfficientNet\nand ProxylessNAS, in terms of ImageNet accuracy or the number of parameters, in\ntheir original search space.",

          "description": "Effective network congestion control strategies are key to keeping the\nInternet (or any large computer network) operational. Network congestion\ncontrol has been dominated by hand-crafted heuristics for decades. Recently,\nReinforcementLearning (RL) has emerged as an alternative to automatically\noptimize such control strategies. Research so far has primarily considered RL\ninterfaces which block the sender while an agent considers its next action.\nThis is largely an artifact of building on top of frameworks designed for RL in\ngames (e.g. OpenAI Gym). However, this does not translate to real-world\nnetworking environments, where a network sender waiting on a policy without\nsending data leads to under-utilization of bandwidth. We instead propose to\nformulate congestion control with an asynchronous RL agent that handles delayed\nactions. We present MVFST-RL, a scalable framework for congestion control in\nthe QUIC transport protocol that leverages state-of-the-art in asynchronous RL\ntraining with off-policy correction. We analyze modeling improvements to\nmitigate the deviation from Markovian dynamics, and evaluate our method on\nemulated networks from the Pantheon benchmark platform.

          "description": "Car-following behavior has been extensively studied using physics-based\nmodels, such as the Intelligent Driver Model. These models successfully\ninterpret traffic phenomena observed in the real-world but may not fully\ncapture the complex cognitive process of driving. Deep learning models, on the\nother hand, have demonstrated their power in capturing observed traffic\nphenomena but require a large amount of driving data to train. This paper aims\nto develop a family of neural network based car-following models that are\ninformed by physics-based models, which leverage the advantage of both\nphysics-based (being data-efficient and interpretable) and deep learning based\n(being generalizable) models. We design physics-informed deep learning\ncar-following (PIDL-CF) architectures encoded with two popular physics-based\nmodels - IDM and OVM, on which acceleration is predicted for four traffic\nregimes: acceleration, deceleration, cruising, and emergency braking. Two types\nof PIDL-CFM problems are studied, one to predict acceleration only and the\nother to jointly predict acceleration and discover model parameters. We also\ndemonstrate the superior performance of PIDL with the Next Generation\nSIMulation (NGSIM) dataset over baselines, especially when the training data is\nsparse. The results demonstrate the superior performance of neural networks\ninformed by physics over those without. The developed PIDL-CF framework holds\nthe potential for system identification of driving models and for the\ndevelopment of driving-based controls for automated vehicles.",

          "description": "In this paper, we argue that the unsatisfactory out-of-distribution (OOD)\ndetection performance of neural networks is mainly due to the SoftMax loss\nanisotropy and propensity to produce low entropy probability distributions in\ndisagreement with the principle of maximum entropy. Current out-of-distribution\n(OOD) detection approaches usually do not directly fix the SoftMax loss\ndrawbacks but rather build techniques to circumvent it. Unfortunately, those\nmethods usually produce undesired side effects (e.g., classification accuracy\ndrop, additional hyperparameters, slower inferences, and collecting extra\ndata). In the opposite direction, we propose replacing SoftMax loss with a\nnovel loss function that does not suffer from the mentioned weaknesses. The\nproposed IsoMax loss is isotropic (exclusively distance-based) and provides\nhigh entropy posterior probability distributions. Replacing the SoftMax loss by\nIsoMax loss requires no model or training changes. Additionally, the models\ntrained with IsoMax loss produce as fast and energy-efficient inferences as\nthose trained using SoftMax loss. Further, no classification accuracy drop is\nobserved. The proposed method does not rely on outlier/background data,\nhyperparameter tuning, temperature calibration, feature extraction, metric\nlearning, adversarial training, ensemble procedures, or generative models. Our\nexperiments showed that IsoMax loss works as a seamless SoftMax loss drop-in\nreplacement that significantly improves neural networks' OOD detection\nperformance. Therefore, it may be used as a baseline OOD detection approach to\nbe combined with current or future OOD detection techniques to achieve even\nhigher results.",

We captured the inherent chemistry of\nthe macromolecule by using molecular fingerprints for node and edge attributes.\nFor the first time, we demonstrated computation of chemical similarity between\n2 macromolecules of varying chemistry and topology, using exact graph edit\ndistances and graph kernels. We trained interpretable graph neural networks for\na variety of glycan classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.\nOur work has two-fold implications - it provides a general framework for\nrepresentation, comparison, and learning of macromolecules, and it enables\nquantitative chemistry-informed decision-making and iterative design in the\nmacromolecular chemical space.",

Unlike the existing methods that mainly rely on the costly numerical\nintegration, MAGI-X utilizes the powerful functional approximator of neural\nnetwork to learn the unknown nonlinear dynamic within the MAnifold-constrained\nGaussian process Inference (MAGI) framework that completely circumvents the\nnumerical integration.

          "description": "Energy demand forecasting is an essential task performed within the energy\nindustry to help balance supply with demand and maintain a stable load on the\nelectricity grid. As supply transitions towards less reliable renewable energy\ngeneration, smart meters will prove a vital component to aid these forecasting\ntasks. However, smart meter take-up is low among privacy-conscious consumers\nthat fear intrusion upon their fine-grained consumption data. In this work we\npropose and explore a federated learning (FL) based approach for training\nforecasting models in a distributed, collaborative manner whilst retaining the\nprivacy of the underlying data. We compare two approaches: FL, and a clustered\nvariant, FL+HC against a non-private, centralised learning approach and a fully\nprivate, localised learning approach. Within these approaches, we measure model\nperformance using RMSE and computational efficiency via the number of samples\nrequired to train models under each scenario. In addition, we suggest the FL\nstrategies are followed by a personalisation step and show that model\nperformance can be improved by doing so. We show that FL+HC followed by\npersonalisation can achieve a $\\sim$5% improvement in model performance with a\n$\\sim$10x reduction in computation compared to localised learning. Finally we\nprovide advice on private aggregation of predictions for building a private\nend-to-end energy demand forecasting application.",

          "description": "Intelligent city transportation systems are one of the core infrastructures\nof a smart city. The true ingenuity of such an infrastructure lies in providing\nthe commuters with real-time information about citywide transports like public\nbuses, allowing her to pre-plan the travel. However, providing prior\ninformation for transportation systems like public buses in real-time is\ninherently challenging because of the diverse nature of different\nstay-locations that a public bus stops. Although straightforward factors stay\nduration, extracted from unimodal sources like GPS, at these locations look\nerratic, a thorough analysis of public bus GPS trails for 720km of bus travels\nat the city of Durgapur, a semi-urban city in India, reveals that several other\nfine-grained contextual features can characterize these locations accurately.\nAccordingly, we develop BuStop, a system for extracting and characterizing the\nstay locations from multi-modal sensing using commuters' smartphones. Using\nthis multi-modal information BuStop extracts a set of granular contextual\nfeatures that allow the system to differentiate among the different\nstay-location types. A thorough analysis of BuStop using the collected dataset\nindicates that the system works with high accuracy in identifying different\nstay locations like regular bus stops, random ad-hoc stops, stops due to\ntraffic congestion stops at traffic signals, and stops at sharp turns.\nAdditionally, we also develop a proof-of-concept setup on top of BuStop to\nanalyze the potential of the framework in predicting expected arrival time, a\ncritical piece of information required to pre-plan travel, at any given bus\nstop. Subsequent analysis of the PoC framework, through simulation over the\ntest dataset, shows that characterizing the stay-locations indeed helps make\nmore accurate arrival time predictions with deviations less than 60s from the\nground-truth arrival time.",

          "description": "When working to understand usage of a data format, examples of the data\nformat are often more representative than the format's specification. For\nexample, two different applications might use very different JSON\nrepresentations, or two PDF-writing applications might make use of very\ndifferent areas of the PDF specification to realize the same rendered content.\nThe complexity arising from these distinct origins can lead to large,\ndifficult-to-understand attack surfaces, presenting a security concern when\nconsidering both exfiltration and data schizophrenia. Grammar inference can aid\nin describing the practical language generator behind examples of a data\nformat. However, most grammar inference research focuses on natural language,\nnot data formats, and fails to support crucial features such as type recursion.\nWe propose a novel set of mechanisms for grammar inference, RL-GRIT, and apply\nthem to understanding de facto data formats. After reviewing existing grammar\ninference solutions, it was determined that a new, more flexible scaffold could\nbe found in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Within this work, we lay out the many\nalgorithmic changes required to adapt RL from its traditional, sequential-time\nenvironment to the highly interdependent environment of parsing. The result is\nan algorithm which can demonstrably learn recursive control structures in\nsimple data formats, and can extract meaningful structure from fragments of the\nPDF format. Whereas prior work in grammar inference focused on either regular\nlanguages or constituency parsing, we show that RL can be used to surpass the\nexpressiveness of both classes, and offers a clear path to learning\ncontext-sensitive languages. The proposed algorithm can serve as a building\nblock for understanding the ecosystems of de facto data formats.",

          "description": "Building machine learning models using EEG recorded outside of the laboratory\nsetting requires methods robust to noisy data and randomly missing channels.\nThis need is particularly great when working with sparse EEG montages (1-6\nchannels), often encountered in consumer-grade or mobile EEG devices. Neither\nclassical machine learning models nor deep neural networks trained end-to-end\non EEG are typically designed or tested for robustness to corruption, and\nespecially to randomly missing channels. While some studies have proposed\nstrategies for using data with missing channels, these approaches are not\npractical when sparse montages are used and computing power is limited (e.g.,\nwearables, cell phones). To tackle this problem, we propose dynamic spatial\nfiltering (DSF), a multi-head attention module that can be plugged in before\nthe first layer of a neural network to handle missing EEG channels by learning\nto focus on good channels and to ignore bad ones. We tested DSF on public EEG\ndata encompassing ~4,000 recordings with simulated channel corruption and on a\nprivate dataset of ~100 at-home recordings of mobile EEG with natural\ncorruption. Our proposed approach achieves the same performance as baseline\nmodels when no noise is applied, but outperforms baselines by as much as 29.4%\naccuracy when significant channel corruption is present. Moreover, DSF outputs\nare interpretable, making it possible to monitor channel importance in\nreal-time.

          "description": "Deep learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples that\nare elaborately designed for malicious purposes and are imperceptible to the\nhuman perceptual system. Autoencoder, when trained solely over benign examples,\nhas been widely used for (self-supervised) adversarial detection based on the\nassumption that adversarial examples yield larger reconstruction error.\nHowever, because lacking adversarial examples in its training and the too\nstrong generalization ability of autoencoder, this assumption does not always\nhold true in practice. To alleviate this problem, we explore to detect\nadversarial examples by disentangled representations of images under the\nautoencoder structure. By disentangling input images as class features and\nsemantic features, we train an autoencoder, assisted by a discriminator\nnetwork, over both correctly paired class/semantic features and incorrectly\npaired class/semantic features to reconstruct benign and counterexamples. This\nmimics the behavior of adversarial examples and can reduce the unnecessary\ngeneralization ability of autoencoder. Compared with the state-of-the-art\nself-supervised detection methods, our method exhibits better performance in\nvarious measurements (i.e., AUC, FPR, TPR) over different datasets (MNIST,\nFashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10), different adversarial attack methods (FGSM, BIM,\nPGD, DeepFool, and CW) and different victim models (8-layer CNN and 16-layer\nVGG). We compare our method with the state-of-the-art self-supervised detection\nmethods under different adversarial attacks and different victim models (30\nattack settings), and it exhibits better performance in various measurements\n(AUC, FPR, TPR) for most attacks settings. Ideally, AUC is $1$ and our method\nachieves $0.99+$ on CIFAR-10 for all attacks.

          "description": "The National Airspace System (NAS) is a complex and evolving system that\nenables safe and efficient aviation. Advanced air mobility concepts and new\nairspace entrants, such as unmanned aircraft, must integrate into the NAS\nwithout degrading overall safety or efficiency. For instance, regulations,\nstandards, and systems are required to mitigate the risk of a midair collision\nbetween aircraft. Monte Carlo simulations have been a foundational capability\nfor decades to develop, assess, and certify aircraft conflict avoidance\nsystems. These are often validated through human-in-the-loop experiments and\nflight testing. For many aviation safety studies, manned aircraft behavior is\nrepresented using dynamic Bayesian networks. The original statistical models\nwere developed from 2008-2013 to support safety simulations for altitudes above\n500 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). However, these models were not sufficient to\nassess the safety of smaller UAS operations below 500 feet AGL. In response,\nnewer models with altitude floors below 500 feet AGL have been in development\nsince 2018. Many of the models assume that aircraft behavior is uncorrelated\nand not dependent on air traffic services or nearby aircraft. Our research\nobjective was to compare the various uncorrelated models of conventional\naircraft and identify how the models differ. Particularly if models of\nrotorcraft were sufficiently different than models of fixed-wing aircraft to\nrequire type specific models. The primary contribution is guidance on which\nuncorrelated models to leverage when evaluating the performance of a collision\navoidance system designed for low altitude operations. We also address which\nmodels can be surrogates for noncooperative aircraft without transponders.",

While there exist methods that can perform feature extraction and\ntracking for volumetric data, performing those tasks for particle data is more\nchallenging because of the lack of explicit connectivity information. Although\none may convert the particle data to volume first, this approach is at risk of\nincurring error and increasing the size of the data. In this paper, we take a\ndeep learning approach to create feature representations for scientific\nparticle data to assist feature extraction and tracking. We employ a deep\nlearning model, which produces latent vectors to represent the relation between\nspatial locations and physical attributes in a local neighborhood. With the\nlatent vectors, features can be extracted by clustering these vectors. To\nachieve fast feature tracking, the mean-shift tracking algorithm is applied in\nthe feature space, which only requires inference of the latent vector for\nselected regions of interest. We validate our approach using two datasets and\ncompare our method with other existing methods.",

When\ntraining DL models with large number of parameters and/or large datasets, cost\nand speed of training can become prohibitive. Distributed DL training solutions\nthat split a training job into subtasks and execute them over multiple nodes\ncan decrease training time. However, the cost of current solutions, built\npredominantly for cluster computing systems, can still be an issue. In contrast\nto cluster computing systems, Volunteer Computing (VC) systems can lower the\ncost of computing, but applications running on VC systems have to handle fault\ntolerance, variable network latency and heterogeneity of compute nodes, and the\ncurrent solutions are not designed to do so. We design a distributed solution\nthat can run DL training on a VC system by using a data parallel approach. We\nimplement a novel asynchronous SGD scheme called VC-ASGD suited for VC systems.\nIn contrast to traditional VC systems that lower cost by using untrustworthy\nvolunteer devices, we lower cost by leveraging preemptible computing instances\non commercial cloud platforms.

We focus on self-adaptive\nsystems that are based on a traditional Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute feedback\nloop (MAPE). The research questions are centred on the problems that motivate\nthe use of machine learning in self-adaptive systems, the key engineering\naspects of learning in self-adaptation, and open challenges. The search\nresulted in 6709 papers, of which 109 were retained for data collection.\nAnalysis of the collected data shows that machine learning is mostly used for\nupdating adaptation rules and policies to improve system qualities, and\nmanaging resources to better balance qualities and resources. These problems\nare primarily solved using supervised and interactive learning with\nclassification, regression and reinforcement learning as the dominant methods.\nSurprisingly, unsupervised learning that naturally fits automation is only\napplied in a small number of studies. Key open challenges in this area include\nthe performance of learning, managing the effects of learning, and dealing with\nmore complex types of goals.

          "description": "The existence of simple uncoupled no-regret learning dynamics that converge\nto correlated equilibria in normal-form games is a celebrated result in the\ntheory of multi-agent systems. Specifically, it has been known for more than 20\nyears that when all players seek to minimize their internal regret in a\nrepeated normal-form game, the empirical frequency of play converges to a\nnormal-form correlated equilibrium. Extensive-form games generalize normal-form\ngames by modeling both sequential and simultaneous moves, as well as imperfect\ninformation. Because of the sequential nature and presence of private\ninformation in the game, correlation in extensive-form games possesses\nsignificantly different properties than its counterpart in normal-form games,\nmany of which are still open research directions. Extensive-form correlated\nequilibrium (EFCE) has been proposed as the natural extensive-form counterpart\nto the classical notion of correlated equilibrium in normal-form games.\nCompared to the latter, the constraints that define the set of EFCEs are\nsignificantly more complex, as the correlation device must keep into account\nthe evolution of beliefs of each player as they make observations throughout\nthe game. Due to that significant added complexity, the existence of uncoupled\nlearning dynamics leading to an EFCE has remained a challenging open research\nquestion for a long time. In this article, we settle that question by giving\nthe first uncoupled no-regret dynamics that converge to the set of EFCEs in\nn-player general-sum extensive-form games with perfect recall. We show that\neach iterate can be computed in time polynomial in the size of the game tree,\nand that, when all players play repeatedly according to our learning dynamics,\nthe empirical frequency of play is proven to be a O(T^-0.5)-approximate EFCE\nwith high probability after T game repetitions, and an EFCE almost surely in\nthe limit.",

          "description": "The success of deep learning is due, to a large extent, to the remarkable\neffectiveness of gradient-based optimization methods applied to large neural\nnetworks. The purpose of this work is to propose a modern view and a general\nmathematical framework for loss landscapes and efficient optimization in\nover-parameterized machine learning models and systems of non-linear equations,\na setting that includes over-parameterized deep neural networks. Our starting\nobservation is that optimization problems corresponding to such systems are\ngenerally not convex, even locally. We argue that instead they satisfy PL$^*$,\na variant of the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition on most (but not all) of the\nparameter space, which guarantees both the existence of solutions and efficient\noptimization by (stochastic) gradient descent (SGD/GD). The PL$^*$ condition of\nthese systems is closely related to the condition number of the tangent kernel\nassociated to a non-linear system showing how a PL$^*$-based non-linear theory\nparallels classical analyses of over-parameterized linear equations. We show\nthat wide neural networks satisfy the PL$^*$ condition, which explains the\n(S)GD convergence to a global minimum. Finally we propose a relaxation of the\nPL$^*$ condition applicable to \"almost\" over-parameterized systems.",

However, the majority of work only\nconsiders the joint distribution, which has limited utility in practical\nsituations. A more general and useful problem is arbitrary conditional density\nestimation, which aims to model any possible conditional distribution over a\nset of covariates, reflecting the more realistic setting of inference based on\nprior knowledge. We propose a novel method, Arbitrary Conditioning with Energy\n(ACE), that can simultaneously estimate the distribution $p(\\mathbf{x}_u \\mid\n\\mathbf{x}_o)$ for all possible subsets of unobserved features $\\mathbf{x}_u$\nand observed features $\\mathbf{x}_o$. ACE is designed to avoid unnecessary bias\nand complexity -- we specify densities with a highly expressive energy function\nand reduce the problem to only learning one-dimensional conditionals (from\nwhich more complex distributions can be recovered during inference). This\nresults in an approach that is both simpler and higher-performing than prior\nmethods. We show that ACE achieves state-of-the-art for arbitrary conditional\nlikelihood estimation and data imputation on standard benchmarks.",

          "description": "Missing value problem in spatiotemporal traffic data has long been a\nchallenging topic, in particular for large-scale and high-dimensional data with\ncomplex missing mechanisms and diverse degrees of missingness. Recent studies\nbased on tensor nuclear norm have demonstrated the superiority of tensor\nlearning in imputation tasks by effectively characterizing the complex\ncorrelations/dependencies in spatiotemporal data. However, despite the\npromising results, these approaches do not scale well to large tensors. In this\npaper, we focus on addressing the missing data imputation problem for\nlarge-scale spatiotemporal traffic data. To achieve both high accuracy and\nefficiency, we develop a scalable autoregressive tensor learning model --\nLow-Tubal-Rank Autoregressive Tensor Completion (LATC-Tubal) -- based on the\nexisting framework of Low-Rank Autoregressive Tensor Completion (LATC), which\nis well-suited for spatiotemporal traffic data that characterized by\nmultidimensional structure of location$\\times$ time of day $\\times$ day. In\nparticular, the proposed LATC-Tubal model involves a scalable tensor nuclear\nnorm minimization scheme by integrating linear unitary transformation.\nTherefore, the tensor nuclear norm minimization can be solved by singular value\nthresholding on the transformed matrix of each day while the day-to-day\ncorrelation can be effectively preserved by the unitary transform matrix.\nBefore setting up the experiment, we consider two large-scale 5-minute traffic\nspeed data sets collected by the California PeMS system with 11160 sensors. We\ncompare LATC-Tubal with state-of-the-art baseline models, and find that\nLATC-Tubal can achieve competitively accuracy with a significantly lower\ncomputational cost. In addition, the LATC-Tubal will also benefit other tasks\nin modeling large-scale spatiotemporal traffic data, such as network-level\ntraffic forecasting.",

          "description": "Outliers in weights and activations pose a key challenge for fixed-point\nquantization of neural networks. While they can be addressed by fine-tuning,\nthis is not practical for ML service providers (e.g., Google or Microsoft) who\noften receive customer models without training data. Specialized hardware for\nhandling activation outliers can enable low-precision neural networks, but at\nthe cost of nontrivial area overhead. We instead propose overwrite quantization\n(OverQ), a lightweight hardware technique that opportunistically increases\nbitwidth for activation outliers by overwriting nearby zeros. It has two major\nmodes of operation: range overwrite and precision overwrite. Range overwrite\nreallocates bits to increase the range of outliers, while precision overwrite\nreuses zeros to increase the precision of non-outlier values. Combining range\noverwrite with a simple cascading logic, we handle the vast majority of\noutliers to significantly improve model accuracy at low bitwidth. Our\nexperiments show that with modest cascading, we can consistently handle over\n90% of outliers and achieve +5% ImageNet Top-1 accuracy on a quantized\nResNet-50 at 4 bits. Our ASIC prototype shows OverQ can be implemented\nefficiently on top of existing weight-stationary systolic arrays with small\narea increases per processing element.

          "description": "Deep Learning using the eponymous deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an\nattractive approach towards various data-based problems of theoretical physics\nin the past decade. There has been a clear trend to deeper architectures\ncontaining increasingly more powerful and involved layers. Contrarily, Taylor\ncoefficients of DNNs still appear mainly in the light of interpretability\nstudies, where they are computed at most to first order. However, especially in\ntheoretical physics numerous problems benefit from accessing higher orders, as\nwell. This gap motivates a general formulation of neural network (NN) Taylor\nexpansions. Restricting our analysis to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and\nintroducing quantities we refer to as propagators and vertices, both depending\non the MLP's weights and biases, we establish a graph-theoretical approach.\nSimilarly to Feynman rules in quantum field theories, we can systematically\nassign diagrams containing propagators and vertices to the corresponding\npartial derivative. Examining this approach for S-wave scattering lengths of\nshallow potentials, we observe NNs to adapt their derivatives mainly to the\nleading order of the target function's Taylor expansion. To circumvent this\nproblem, we propose an iterative NN perturbation theory. During each iteration\nwe eliminate the leading order, such that the next-to-leading order can be\nfaithfully learned during the subsequent iteration. After performing two\niterations, we find that the first- and second-order Born terms are correctly\nadapted during the respective iterations. Finally, we combine both results to\nfind a proxy that acts as a machine-learned second-order Born approximation.",

Answering this problem accurately and\nefficiently is essential to many applications, such as density estimation,\noutlier detection, query optimization, and data integration. The estimation\nproblem is especially challenging for large-scale high-dimensional data due to\nthe curse of dimensionality, the large variance of selectivity across different\nqueries, and the need to make the estimator consistent (i.e., the selectivity\nis non-decreasing in the threshold). We propose a new deep learning-based model\nthat learns a query-dependent piecewise linear function as selectivity\nestimator, which is flexible to fit the selectivity curve of any distance\nfunction and query object, while guaranteeing that the output is non-decreasing\nin the threshold.

          "description": "Pre-trained language models such as BERT have exhibited remarkable\nperformances in many tasks in natural language understanding (NLU). The tokens\nin the models are usually fine-grained in the sense that for languages like\nEnglish they are words or sub-words and for languages like Chinese they are\ncharacters. In English, for example, there are multi-word expressions which\nform natural lexical units and thus the use of coarse-grained tokenization also\nappears to be reasonable. In fact, both fine-grained and coarse-grained\ntokenizations have advantages and disadvantages for learning of pre-trained\nlanguage models. In this paper, we propose a novel pre-trained language model,\nreferred to as AMBERT (A Multi-grained BERT), on the basis of both fine-grained\nand coarse-grained tokenizations. For English, AMBERT takes both the sequence\nof words (fine-grained tokens) and the sequence of phrases (coarse-grained\ntokens) as input after tokenization, employs one encoder for processing the\nsequence of words and the other encoder for processing the sequence of the\nphrases, utilizes shared parameters between the two encoders, and finally\ncreates a sequence of contextualized representations of the words and a\nsequence of contextualized representations of the phrases. Experiments have\nbeen conducted on benchmark datasets for Chinese and English, including CLUE,\nGLUE, SQuAD and RACE. The results show that AMBERT can outperform BERT in all\ncases, particularly the improvements are significant for Chinese. We also\ndevelop a method to improve the efficiency of AMBERT in inference, which still\nperforms better than BERT with the same computational cost as BERT.",

Previous work has shown\nthat, to improve robustness against such attacks, learning algorithms should\navoid overemphasizing few discriminant features, providing instead decisions\nthat rely upon a large subset of components. In this work, we investigate\nwhether gradient-based attribution methods, used to explain classifiers'\ndecisions by identifying the most relevant features, can be used to help\nidentify and select more robust algorithms. To this end, we propose to exploit\ntwo different metrics that represent the evenness of explanations, and a new\ncompact security measure called Adversarial Robustness Metric. Our experiments\nconducted on two different datasets and five classification algorithms for\nAndroid malware detection show that a strong connection exists between the\nuniformity of explanations and adversarial robustness. In particular, we found\nthat popular techniques like Gradient*Input and Integrated Gradients are\nstrongly correlated to security when applied to both linear and nonlinear\ndetectors, while more elementary explanation techniques like the simple\nGradient do not provide reliable information about the robustness of such\nclassifiers.",

This approach produces more\nrobust NLI models, outperforming previous de-biasing efforts when generalised\nto 12 other datasets (Belinkov et al., 2019a; Mahabadi et al., 2020).

Applications in real-world time series should consider\ntwo factors for achieving reliable predictions: modeling dynamic dependencies\namong multiple variables and adjusting the model's intrinsic hyperparameters. A\nstill open gap in that literature is that statistical and ensemble learning\napproaches systematically present lower predictive performance than deep\nlearning methods. They generally disregard the data sequence aspect entangled\nwith multivariate data represented in more than one time series. Conversely,\nthis work presents a novel neural network architecture for time-series\nforecasting that combines the power of graph evolution with deep recurrent\nlearning on distinct data distributions; we named our method Recurrent Graph\nEvolution Neural Network (ReGENN). The idea is to infer multiple multivariate\nrelationships between co-occurring time-series by assuming that the temporal\ndata depends not only on inner variables and intra-temporal relationships\n(i.e., observations from itself) but also on outer variables and inter-temporal\nrelationships (i.e., observations from other-selves). An extensive set of\nexperiments was conducted comparing ReGENN with dozens of ensemble methods and\nclassical statistical ones, showing sound improvement of up to 64.87% over the\ncompeting algorithms. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the intermediate\nweights arising from ReGENN, showing that by looking at inter and\nintra-temporal relationships simultaneously, time-series forecasting is majorly\nimproved if paying attention to how multiple multivariate data synchronously\nevolve.",

To handle the limitations, we propose a novel causality\ndetection model named MCDN to explicitly model causal reasoning process, and\nfurthermore, to exploit the advantages of both methods.

While model-based agents are conceptually\nappealing, their policies tend to lag behind those of model-free agents in\nterms of final reward, especially in non-trivial environments. In response,\nresearchers have proposed model-based agents with increasingly complex\ncomponents, from ensembles of probabilistic dynamics models, to heuristics for\nmitigating model error. In a reversal of this trend, we show that simple\nmodel-based agents can be derived from existing ideas that not only match, but\noutperform state-of-the-art model-free agents in terms of both\nsample-efficiency and final reward. We find that a model-free soft value\nestimate for policy evaluation and a model-based stochastic value gradient for\npolicy improvement is an effective combination, achieving state-of-the-art\nresults on a high-dimensional humanoid control task, which most model-based\nagents are unable to solve.

          "description": "A dynamical system can be regarded as an information processing apparatus\nthat encodes input streams from the external environment to its state and\nprocesses them through state transitions. The information processing capacity\n(IPC) is an excellent tool that comprehensively evaluates these processed\ninputs, providing details of unknown information processing in black box\nsystems; however, this measure can be applied to only time-invariant systems.\nThis paper extends the applicable range to time-variant systems and further\nreveals that the IPC is equivalent to coefficients of polynomial chaos (PC)\nexpansion in more general dynamical systems. To achieve this objective, we\ntackle three issues. First, we establish a connection between the IPC for\ntime-invariant systems and PC expansion, which is a type of polynomial\nexpansion using orthogonal functions of input history as bases. We prove that\nthe IPC corresponds to the squared norm of the coefficient vector of the basis\nin the PC expansion. Second, we show that an input following an arbitrary\ndistribution can be used for the IPC, removing previous restrictions to\nspecific input distributions. Third, we extend the conventional orthogonal\nbases to functions of both time and input history and propose the IPC for\ntime-variant systems. To show the significance of our approach, we demonstrate\nthat our measure can reveal information representations in not only machine\nlearning networks but also a real, cultured neural network. Our generalized\nmeasure paves the way for unveiling the information processing capabilities of\na wide variety of physical dynamics which has been left behind in nature.",

          "description": "Modern vehicles, including connected vehicles and autonomous vehicles,\nnowadays involve many electronic control units connected through intra-vehicle\nnetworks to implement various functionalities and perform actions. Modern\nvehicles are also connected to external networks through vehicle-to-everything\ntechnologies, enabling their communications with other vehicles,\ninfrastructures, and smart devices. However, the improving functionality and\nconnectivity of modern vehicles also increase their vulnerabilities to\ncyber-attacks targeting both intra-vehicle and external networks due to the\nlarge attack surfaces. To secure vehicular networks, many researchers have\nfocused on developing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that capitalize on\nmachine learning methods to detect malicious cyber-attacks. In this paper, the\nvulnerabilities of intra-vehicle and external networks are discussed, and a\nmulti-tiered hybrid IDS that incorporates a signature-based IDS and an\nanomaly-based IDS is proposed to detect both known and unknown attacks on\nvehicular networks. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed system\ncan detect various types of known attacks with 99.99% accuracy on the\nCAN-intrusion-dataset representing the intra-vehicle network data and 99.88%\naccuracy on the CICIDS2017 dataset illustrating the external vehicular network\ndata. For the zero-day attack detection, the proposed system achieves high\nF1-scores of 0.963 and 0.800 on the above two datasets, respectively. The\naverage processing time of each data packet on a vehicle-level machine is less\nthan 0.6 ms, which shows the feasibility of implementing the proposed system in\nreal-time vehicle systems.

          "description": "Embedding Artificial Intelligence onto low-power devices is a challenging\ntask that has been partly overcome with recent advances in machine learning and\nhardware design. Presently, deep neural networks can be deployed on embedded\ntargets to perform different tasks such as speech recognition,object detection\nor Human Activity Recognition. However, there is still room for optimization of\ndeep neural networks onto embedded devices. These optimizations mainly address\npower consumption,memory and real-time constraints, but also an easier\ndeployment at the edge. Moreover, there is still a need for a better\nunderstanding of what can be achieved for different use cases.

The quantization methods, relevant in the context of\nan embedded execution onto a microcontroller, are first outlined. Then, a new\nframework for end-to-end deep neural networks training, quantization and\ndeployment is presented. This framework, called MicroAI, is designed as an\nalternative to existing inference engines (TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers\nand STM32Cube.AI). Our framework can indeed be easily adjusted and/or extended\nfor specific use cases. Execution using single precision 32-bit floating-point\nas well as fixed-point on 8- and 16-bit integers are supported. The proposed\nquantization method is evaluated with three different datasets (UCI-HAR, Spoken\nMNIST and GTSRB).

          "description": "We consider a multi-objective optimization problem with objective functions\nthat are expensive to evaluate. The decision maker (DM) has unknown\npreferences, and so the standard approach is to generate an approximation of\nthe Pareto front and let the DM choose from the generated non-dominated\ndesigns. However, especially for expensive to evaluate problems where the\nnumber of designs that can be evaluated is very limited, the true best solution\naccording to the DM's unknown preferences is unlikely to be among the small set\nof non-dominated solutions found, even if these solutions are truly Pareto\noptimal. We address this issue by using a multi-objective Bayesian optimization\nalgorithm and allowing the DM to select a preferred solution from a predicted\ncontinuous Pareto front just once before the end of the algorithm rather than\nselecting a solution after the end. This allows the algorithm to understand the\nDM's preferences and make a final attempt to identify a more preferred\nsolution. We demonstrate the idea using ParEGO, and show empirically that the\nfound solutions are significantly better in terms of true DM preferences than\nif the DM would simply pick a solution at the end.",

          "description": "Sorted l1 regularization has been incorporated into many methods for solving\nhigh-dimensional statistical estimation problems, including the SLOPE estimator\nin linear regression. In this paper, we study how this relatively new\nregularization technique improves variable selection by characterizing the\noptimal SLOPE trade-off between the false discovery proportion (FDP) and true\npositive proportion (TPP) or, equivalently, between measures of type I error\nand power. Assuming a regime of linear sparsity and working under Gaussian\nrandom designs, we obtain an upper bound on the optimal trade-off for SLOPE,\nshowing its capability of breaking the Donoho-Tanner power limit. To put it\ninto perspective, this limit is the highest possible power that the Lasso,\nwhich is perhaps the most popular l1-based method, can achieve even with\narbitrarily strong effect sizes. Next, we derive a tight lower bound that\ndelineates the fundamental limit of sorted l1 regularization in optimally\ntrading the FDP off for the TPP. Finally, we show that on any problem instance,\nSLOPE with a certain regularization sequence outperforms the Lasso, in the\nsense of having a smaller FDP, larger TPP and smaller l2 estimation risk\nsimultaneously. Our proofs are based on a novel technique that reduces a\nvariational calculus problem to a class of infinite-dimensional convex\noptimization problems and a very recent result from approximate message passing\ntheory.",

However, significant technical challenges arise\nfrom operational decision making associated with MoD vehicle dispatch and fleet\nrebalancing. For this reason, operators tend to employ simplified algorithms\nthat have been demonstrated to work well in a particular setting. To help\nbridge the gap between novel and existing methods, we propose a modular\nframework for fleet rebalancing based on model-free reinforcement learning (RL)\nthat can leverage an existing dispatch method to minimize system cost. In\nparticular, by treating dispatch as part of the environment dynamics, a\ncentralized agent can learn to intermittently direct the dispatcher to\nreposition free vehicles and mitigate against fleet imbalance. We formulate RL\nstate and action spaces as distributions over a grid partitioning of the\noperating area, making the framework scalable and avoiding the complexities\nassociated with multiagent RL. Numerical experiments, using real-world trip and\nnetwork data, demonstrate that this approach has several distinct advantages\nover baseline methods including: improved system cost; high degree of\nadaptability to the selected dispatch method; and the ability to perform\nscale-invariant transfer learning between problem instances with similar\nvehicle and request distributions.",

First, the provision of suitably\ngeneric pre-trained encoders has been made possible thanks to recent progress\nin self-supervised training methods. Second, pairing each classifier in the\nensemble with a key, where the key-space is identical to the latent space of\nthe encoder, allows them to be used collectively, yet selectively, via\nk-nearest neighbour lookup. We show that models trained with the\nencoders-and-ensembles architecture are state-of-the-art for the task-free\nsetting on standard image classification continual learning benchmarks, and\nimprove on prior state-of-the-art by a large margin in the most challenging\ncases.

Our experiments show that this reward function changes smoothly with\nrespect to transitions in the MDP and assists the agent in learning.\nAdditionally, we combine AIM with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and show\nthat the resulting algorithm accelerates learning significantly on several\nsimulated robotics tasks when compared to HER with a sparse positive reward at\nthe goal state.",

          "description": "Many important application domains generate distributed collections of\nheterogeneous local datasets. These local datasets are often related via an\nintrinsic network structure that arises from domain-specific notions of\nsimilarity between local datasets. Different notions of similarity are induced\nby spatiotemporal proximity, statistical dependencies, or functional relations.\nWe use this network structure to adaptively pool similar local datasets into\nnearly homogenous training sets for learning tailored models. Our main\nconceptual contribution is to formulate networked federated learning using the\nconcept of generalized total variation (GTV) minimization as a regularizer.\nThis formulation is highly flexible and can be combined with almost any\nparametric model including Lasso or deep neural networks. We unify and\nconsiderably extend some well-known approaches to federated multi-task\nlearning. Our main algorithmic contribution is a novel federated learning\nalgorithm that is well suited for distributed computing environments such as\nedge computing over wireless networks. This algorithm is robust against model\nmisspecification and numerical errors arising from limited computational\nresources including processing time or wireless channel bandwidth. As our main\ntechnical contribution, we offer precise conditions on the local models as well\non their network structure such that our algorithm learns nearly optimal local\nmodels. Our analysis reveals an interesting interplay between the\n(information-) geometry of local models and the (cluster-) geometry of their\nnetwork.",

          "description": "We present a novel approach based on artificial neural networks, so-called\ngeodesyNets, and present compelling evidence of their ability to serve as\naccurate geodetic models of highly irregular bodies using minimal prior\ninformation on the body. The approach does not rely on the body shape\ninformation but, if available, can harness it. GeodesyNets learn a\nthree-dimensional, differentiable, function representing the body density,\nwhich we call neural density field. The body shape, as well as other geodetic\nproperties, can easily be recovered. We investigate six different shapes\nincluding the bodies 101955 Bennu, 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko, 433 Eros and\n25143 Itokawa for which shape models developed during close proximity surveys\nare available. Both heterogeneous and homogeneous mass distributions are\nconsidered. The gravitational acceleration computed from the trained\ngeodesyNets models, as well as the inferred body shape, show great accuracy in\nall cases with a relative error on the predicted acceleration smaller than 1\\%\neven close to the asteroid surface. When the body shape information is\navailable, geodesyNets can seamlessly exploit it and be trained to represent a\nhigh-fidelity neural density field able to give insights into the internal\nstructure of the body.

          "description": "Modeling of non-rigid object launching and manipulation is complex\nconsidering the wide range of dynamics affecting trajectory, many of which may\nbe unknown. Using physics models can be inaccurate because they cannot account\nfor unknown factors and the effects of the deformation of the object as it is\nlaunched; moreover, deriving force coefficients for these models is not\npossible without extensive experimental testing. Recently, advancements in\ndata-powered artificial intelligence methods have allowed learnable models and\nsystems to emerge. It is desirable to train a model for launch prediction on a\nrobot, as deep neural networks can account for immeasurable dynamics. However,\nthe inability to collect large amounts of experimental data decreases\nperformance of deep neural networks. Through estimating force coefficients, the\naccepted physics models can be leveraged to produce adequate supplemental data\nto artificially increase the size of the training set, yielding improved neural\nnetworks. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for algorithmic\nestimation of force coefficients for non-rigid object launching, which can be\ngeneralized to other domains, in order to generate large datasets. We implement\na novel training algorithm and objective for our deep neural network to\naccurately model launch trajectory of non-rigid objects and predict whether\nthey will hit a series of targets. Our experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of using simulated data from force coefficient estimation and\nshows the importance of simulated data for training an effective neural\nnetwork.",

          "description": "Many real-world optimisation problems such as hyperparameter tuning in\nmachine learning or simulation-based optimisation can be formulated as\nexpensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. A popular approach to tackle such\nproblems is Bayesian optimisation (BO), which builds a response surface model\nbased on the data collected so far, and uses the mean and uncertainty predicted\nby the model to decide what information to collect next. In this paper, we\npropose a novel variant of the well-known Knowledge Gradient acquisition\nfunction that allows it to handle constraints. We empirically compare the new\nalgorithm with four other state-of-the-art constrained Bayesian optimisation\nalgorithms and demonstrate its superior performance.

          "description": "Recently, opinion summarization, which is the generation of a summary from\nmultiple reviews, has been conducted in a self-supervised manner by considering\na sampled review as a pseudo summary. However, non-text data such as image and\nmetadata related to reviews have been considered less often. To use the\nabundant information contained in non-text data, we propose a self-supervised\nmultimodal opinion summarization framework called MultimodalSum. Our framework\nobtains a representation of each modality using a separate encoder for each\nmodality, and the text decoder generates a summary. To resolve the inherent\nheterogeneity of multimodal data, we propose a multimodal training pipeline. We\nfirst pretrain the text encoder--decoder based solely on text modality data.\nSubsequently, we pretrain the non-text modality encoders by considering the\npretrained text decoder as a pivot for the homogeneous representation of\nmultimodal data. Finally, to fuse multimodal representations, we train the\nentire framework in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate the superiority of\nMultimodalSum by conducting experiments on Yelp and Amazon datasets.",

In\nthis paper, we investigate one emerging question if model's equilibrium point\ncan be regarded as the solution of an optimization problem. Specifically, we\nfirst decompose DNNs into a new class of unit layer that is differential of an\nimplicit convex function while keeping its output unchanged. Then, the\nequilibrium model of the unit layer can be derived, named Optimization Induced\nEquilibrium Networks (OptEq), which can be easily extended to deep layers. The\nequilibrium point of OptEq can be theoretically connected to the solution of\nits corresponding convex optimization problem with explicit objectives. Based\non this, we can flexibly introduce prior properties to the equilibrium points:\n1) modifying the underlying convex problems explicitly so as to change the\narchitectures of OptEq; and 2) merging the information into the fixed point\niteration, which guarantees to choose the desired equilibrium when the fixed\npoint set is non-singleton.

          "description": "InfoNCE loss is a widely used loss function for contrastive model training.\nIt aims to estimate the mutual information between a pair of variables by\ndiscriminating between each positive pair and its associated $K$ negative\npairs. It is proved that when the sample labels are clean, the lower bound of\nmutual information estimation is tighter when more negative samples are\nincorporated, which usually yields better model performance. However, in many\nreal-world tasks the labels often contain noise, and incorporating too many\nnoisy negative samples for model training may be suboptimal. In this paper, we\nstudy how many negative samples are optimal for InfoNCE in different scenarios\nvia a semi-quantitative theoretical framework. More specifically, we first\npropose a probabilistic model to analyze the influence of the negative sampling\nratio $K$ on training sample informativeness. Then, we design a training\neffectiveness function to measure the overall influence of training samples on\nmodel learning based on their informativeness. We estimate the optimal negative\nsampling ratio using the $K$ value that maximizes the training effectiveness\nfunction. Based on our framework, we further propose an adaptive negative\nsampling method that can dynamically adjust the negative sampling ratio to\nimprove InfoNCE based model training. Extensive experiments on different\nreal-world datasets show our framework can accurately predict the optimal\nnegative sampling ratio in different tasks, and our proposed adaptive negative\nsampling method can achieve better performance than the commonly used fixed\nnegative sampling ratio strategy.",

Existing predictive models\ntypically ignore the inconsistencies and imperfections in heterogeneous data\nwhile also failing to consider the (1) spatial correlations among monitoring\npoints or (2) predictions for the entire study area. To address the above\nproblems, this paper proposes a deep learning method for fusing heterogeneous\ndata collected from multiple monitoring points using graph convolutional\nnetworks (GCNs) to predict the future trends of some observations and evaluates\nits effectiveness by applying it in an air quality predictions scenario. The\nessential idea behind the proposed method is to (1) fuse the collected\nheterogeneous data based on the locations of the monitoring points with regard\nto their spatial correlations and (2) perform prediction based on global\ninformation rather than local information. In the proposed method, first, we\nassemble a fusion matrix using the proposed RBF-based fusion approach; second,\nbased on the fused data, we construct spatially and temporally correlated data\nas inputs for the predictive model; finally, we employ the spatiotemporal graph\nconvolutional network (STGCN) to predict the future trends of some\nobservations. In the application scenario of air quality prediction, it is\nobserved that (1) the fused data derived from the RBF-based fusion approach\nachieve satisfactory consistency; (2) the performances of the prediction models\nbased on fused data are better than those based on raw data; and (3) the STGCN\nmodel achieves the best performance when compared to those of all baseline\nmodels. The proposed method is applicable for similar scenarios where\ncontinuous heterogeneous data are collected from multiple monitoring points\nscattered across a study area.",

          "description": "With the capability of accurately representing a functional relationship\nbetween the inputs of a physical system's model and output quantities of\ninterest, neural networks have become popular for surrogate modeling in\nscientific applications. However, as these networks are over-parameterized,\ntheir training often requires a large amount of data. To prevent overfitting\nand improve generalization error, regularization based on, e.g., $\\ell_1$- and\n$\\ell_2$-norms of the parameters is applied. Similarly, multiple connections of\nthe network may be pruned to increase sparsity in the network parameters. In\nthis paper, we explore the effects of sparsity promoting\n$\\ell_1$-regularization on training neural networks when only a small training\ndataset from a high-fidelity model is available. As opposed to standard\n$\\ell_1$-regularization that is known to be inadequate, we consider two\nvariants of $\\ell_1$-regularization informed by the parameters of an identical\nnetwork trained using data from lower-fidelity models of the problem at hand.\nThese bi-fidelity strategies are generalizations of transfer learning of neural\nnetworks that uses the parameters learned from a large low-fidelity dataset to\nefficiently train networks for a small high-fidelity dataset. We also compare\nthe bi-fidelity strategies with two $\\ell_1$-regularization methods that only\nuse the high-fidelity dataset.

          "description": "Knowledge distillation, i.e., one classifier being trained on the outputs of\nanother classifier, is an empirically very successful technique for knowledge\ntransfer between classifiers. It has even been observed that classifiers learn\nmuch faster and more reliably if trained with the outputs of another classifier\nas soft labels, instead of from ground truth data. So far, however, there is no\nsatisfactory theoretical explanation of this phenomenon. In this work, we\nprovide the first insights into the working mechanisms of distillation by\nstudying the special case of linear and deep linear classifiers. Specifically,\nwe prove a generalization bound that establishes fast convergence of the\nexpected risk of a distillation-trained linear classifier. From the bound and\nits proof we extract three key factors that determine the success of\ndistillation: * data geometry -- geometric properties of the data distribution,\nin particular class separation, has a direct influence on the convergence speed\nof the risk; * optimization bias -- gradient descent optimization finds a very\nfavorable minimum of the distillation objective; and * strong monotonicity --\nthe expected risk of the student classifier always decreases when the size of\nthe training set grows.",

          "description": "In label-noise learning, estimating the transition matrix is a hot topic as\nthe matrix plays an important role in building statistically consistent\nclassifiers. Traditionally, the transition from clean distribution to noisy\ndistribution (i.e., clean label transition matrix) has been widely exploited to\nlearn a clean label classifier by employing the noisy data. Motivated by that\nclassifiers mostly output Bayes optimal labels for prediction, in this paper,\nwe study to directly model the transition from Bayes optimal distribution to\nnoisy distribution (i.e., Bayes label transition matrix) and learn a Bayes\noptimal label classifier. Note that given only noisy data, it is ill-posed to\nestimate either the clean label transition matrix or the Bayes label transition\nmatrix. But favorably, Bayes optimal labels are less uncertain compared with\nthe clean labels, i.e., the class posteriors of Bayes optimal labels are\none-hot vectors while those of clean labels are not. This enables two\nadvantages to estimate the Bayes label transition matrix, i.e., (a) we could\ntheoretically recover a set of Bayes optimal labels under mild conditions; (b)\nthe feasible solution space is much smaller. By exploiting the advantages, we\nestimate the Bayes label transition matrix by employing a deep neural network\nin a parameterized way, leading to better generalization and superior\nclassification performance.",

To incorporate both spatial and temporal features, we develop a hybrid\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) model,\nwhere the features are extracted from each axial slice of the CT scan by a CNN,\nthese sequence of image features are input to a RNN for classification of the\nCT scan.

          "description": "The rapidly-changing ML model landscape presents a unique opportunity for\nbuilding hardware accelerators optimized for specific datacenter-scale\nworkloads. We propose Full-stack Accelerator Search Technique (FAST), a\nhardware accelerator search framework that defines a broad optimization\nenvironment covering key design decisions within the hardware-software stack,\nincluding hardware datapath, software scheduling, and compiler passes such as\noperation fusion and tensor padding. Although FAST can be used on any number\nand type of deep learning workload, in this paper we focus on optimizing for a\nsingle or small set of vision models, resulting in significantly faster and\nmore power-efficient designs relative to a general purpose ML accelerator. When\nevaluated on EfficientNet, ResNet50v2, and OCR inference performance relative\nto a TPU-v3, designs generated by FAST optimized for single workloads can\nimprove Perf/TDP (peak power) by over 6x in the best case and 4x on average. On\na limited workload subset, FAST improves Perf/TDP 2.85x on average, with a\nreduction to 2.35x for a single design optimized over the set of workloads. In\naddition, we demonstrate a potential 1.8x speedup opportunity for TPU-v3 with\nimproved scheduling.",

          "description": "This paper addresses a new interpretation of reinforcement learning (RL) as\nreverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence optimization, and derives a new\noptimization method using forward KL divergence. Although RL originally aims to\nmaximize return indirectly through optimization of policy, the recent work by\nLevine has proposed a different derivation process with explicit consideration\nof optimality as stochastic variable. This paper follows this concept and\nformulates the traditional learning laws for both value function and policy as\nthe optimization problems with reverse KL divergence including optimality.\nFocusing on the asymmetry of KL divergence, the new optimization problems with\nforward KL divergence are derived. Remarkably, such new optimization problems\ncan be regarded as optimistic RL. That optimism is intuitively specified by a\nhyperparameter converted from an uncertainty parameter. In addition, it can be\nenhanced when it is integrated with prioritized experience replay and\neligibility traces, both of which accelerate learning. The effects of this\nexpected optimism was investigated through learning tendencies on numerical\nsimulations using Pybullet. As a result, moderate optimism accelerated learning\nand yielded higher rewards. In a realistic robotic simulation, the proposed\nmethod with the moderate optimism outperformed one of the state-of-the-art RL\nmethod.",

          "description": "Stochastic simulation aims to compute output performance for complex models\nthat lack analytical tractability.

Conventional methods\napproach these tasks by assessing the model-data match via simple hypothesis\ntests or distance minimization in an ad hoc fashion, but they can encounter\nchallenges arising from non-identifiability and high dimensionality. In this\npaper, we investigate a framework to develop calibration schemes that satisfy\nrigorous frequentist statistical guarantees, via a basic notion that we call\neligibility set designed to bypass non-identifiability via a set-based\nestimation.

Discrepancies in the nature itself of an\nanomaly lead to multiple paradigms of algorithms design and experimentation.\nPredictive maintenance is a special case, where the anomaly represents a\nfailure that must be prevented. Related time-series research as outlier and\nnovelty detection or time-series classification does not apply to the concept\nof an anomaly in this field, because they are not single points which have not\nbeen seen previously and may not be precisely annotated. Moreover, due to the\nlack of annotated anomalous data, many benchmarks are adapted from supervised\nscenarios.\n\nTo address these issues, we generalise the concept of positive and negative\ninstances to intervals to be able to evaluate unsupervised anomaly detection\nalgorithms. We also preserve the imbalance scheme for evaluation through the\nproposal of the Preceding Window ROC, a generalisation for the calculation of\nROC curves for time-series scenarios. We also adapt the mechanism from a\nestablished time-series anomaly detection benchmark to the proposed\ngeneralisations to reward early detection. Therefore, the proposal represents a\nflexible evaluation framework for the different scenarios.

In this work, we aim to theoretically understand the\nrelationship between these two approaches, which are the cornerstones of\nmodel-based recommendations. Through the derivation and analysis of the\nclosed-form solutions for two basic regression and matrix factorization\napproaches, we found these two approaches are indeed inherently related but\nalso diverge in how they \"scale-down\" the singular values of the original\nuser-item interaction matrix. This analysis also helps resolve the questions\nrelated to the regularization parameter range and model complexities. We\nfurther introduce a new learning algorithm in searching (hyper)parameters for\nthe closed-form solution and utilize it to discover the nearby models of the\nexisting solutions. The experimental results demonstrate that the basic models\nand their closed-form solutions are indeed quite competitive against the\nstate-of-the-art models, thus, confirming the validity of studying the basic\nmodels.

          "description": "Classically, data interpolation with a parametrized model class is possible\nas long as the number of parameters is larger than the number of equations to\nbe satisfied. A puzzling phenomenon in deep learning is that models are trained\nwith many more parameters than what this classical theory would suggest. We\npropose a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. We prove that for a\nbroad class of data distributions and model classes, overparametrization is\nnecessary if one wants to interpolate the data smoothly. Namely we show that\nsmooth interpolation requires $d$ times more parameters than mere\ninterpolation, where $d$ is the ambient data dimension. We prove this universal\nlaw of robustness for any smoothly parametrized function class with polynomial\nsize weights, and any covariate distribution verifying isoperimetry. In the\ncase of two-layers neural networks and Gaussian covariates, this law was\nconjectured in prior work by Bubeck, Li and Nagaraj.",

          "description": "Accurate reconstruction of static environments from LiDAR scans of scenes\ncontaining dynamic objects, which we refer to as Dynamic to Static Translation\n(DST), is an important area of research in Autonomous Navigation. This problem\nhas been recently explored for visual SLAM, but to the best of our knowledge no\nwork has been attempted to address DST for LiDAR scans. The problem is of\ncritical importance due to wide-spread adoption of LiDAR in Autonomous\nVehicles. We show that state-of the art methods developed for the visual domain\nwhen adapted for LiDAR scans perform poorly.\n\nWe develop DSLR, a deep generative model which learns a mapping between\ndynamic scan to its static counterpart through an adversarially trained\nautoencoder. Our model yields the first solution for DST on LiDAR that\ngenerates static scans without using explicit segmentation labels. DSLR cannot\nalways be applied to real world data due to lack of paired dynamic-static\nscans. Using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, we propose DSLR-UDA for transfer\nto real world data and experimentally show that this performs well in real\nworld settings. Additionally, if segmentation information is available, we\nextend DSLR to DSLR-Seg to further improve the reconstruction quality.\n\nDSLR gives the state of the art performance on simulated and real-world\ndatasets and also shows at least 4x improvement. We show that DSLR, unlike the\nexisting baselines, is a practically viable model with its reconstruction\nquality within the tolerable limits for tasks pertaining to autonomous\nnavigation like SLAM in dynamic environments.",

Here we present XOmiVAE, a novel\ninterpretable deep learning model for cancer classification using\nhigh-dimensional omics data. XOmiVAE is able to obtain contribution values of\neach gene and latent dimension for a specific prediction, and the correlation\nbetween genes and the latent dimensions.

To the best of our knowledge, XOmiVAE\nis one of the first activated-based deep learning interpretation method to\nexplain novel clusters generated by variational autoencoders. The results\ngenerated by XOmiVAE were validated by both the biomedical knowledge and the\nperformance of downstream tasks. XOmiVAE explanations of deep learning based\ncancer classification and clustering aligned with current domain knowledge\nincluding biological annotation and literature, which shows great potential for\nnovel biomedical knowledge discovery from deep learning models. The top XOmiVAE\nselected genes and dimensions shown significant influence to the performance of\ncancer classification.

          "description": "A major goal of materials design is to find material structures with desired\nproperties and in a second step to find a processing path to reach one of these\nstructures. In this paper, we propose and investigate a deep reinforcement\nlearning approach for the optimization of processing paths. The goal is to find\noptimal processing paths in the material structure space that lead to\ntarget-structures, which have been identified beforehand to result in desired\nmaterial properties. As the relation between properties and structures is\ngenerally non-unique, typically a whole set of target-structures can be\nidentified, that lead to desired properties. Our proposed method optimizes\nprocessing paths from a start structure to one of these equivalent\ntarget-structures. The algorithm learns to find near-optimal paths by\ninteracting with the structure-generating process. It is guided by structure\ndescriptors as process state features and a reward signal, which is formulated\nbased on a distance function in the structure space. The model-free\nreinforcement learning algorithm learns through trial and error while\ninteracting with the process and does not rely on a priori sampled processing\ndata. We instantiate and evaluate the proposed methods by optimizing paths of a\ngeneric metal forming process.",

          "description": "The heavy traffic and related issues have always been concerns for modern\ncities. With the help of deep learning and reinforcement learning, people have\nproposed various policies to solve these traffic-related problems, such as\nsmart traffic signal control systems and taxi dispatching systems. People\nusually validate these policies in a city simulator, since directly applying\nthem in the real city introduces real cost. However, these policies validated\nin the city simulator may fail in the real city if the simulator is\nsignificantly different from the real world. To tackle this problem, we need to\nbuild a real-like traffic simulation system. Therefore, in this paper, we\npropose to learn the human routing model, which is one of the most essential\npart in the traffic simulator. This problem has two major challenges. First,\nhuman routing decisions are determined by multiple factors, besides the common\ntime and distance factor. Second, current historical routes data usually covers\njust a small portion of vehicles, due to privacy and device availability\nissues. To address these problems, we propose a theory-guided residual network\nmodel, where the theoretical part can emphasize the general principles for\nhuman routing decisions (e.g., fastest route), and the residual part can\ncapture drivable condition preferences (e.g., local road or highway). Since the\ntheoretical part is composed of traditional shortest path algorithms that do\nnot need data to train, our residual network can learn human routing models\nfrom limited data. We have conducted extensive experiments on multiple\nreal-world datasets to show the superior performance of our model, especially\nwith small data. Besides, we have also illustrated why our model is better at\nrecovering real routes through case studies.",

          "description": "Recent years have witnessed an upsurge of interest in the problem of anomaly\ndetection on attributed networks due to its importance in both research and\npractice. Although various approaches have been proposed to solve this problem,\ntwo major limitations exist: (1) unsupervised approaches usually work much less\nefficiently due to the lack of supervisory signal, and (2) existing anomaly\ndetection methods only use local contextual information to detect anomalous\nnodes, e.g., one- or two-hop information, but ignore the global contextual\ninformation. Since anomalous nodes differ from normal nodes in structures and\nattributes, it is intuitive that the distance between anomalous nodes and their\nneighbors should be larger than that between normal nodes and their neighbors\nif we remove the edges connecting anomalous and normal nodes. Thus, hop counts\nbased on both global and local contextual information can be served as the\nindicators of anomaly. Motivated by this intuition, we propose a hop-count\nbased model (HCM) to detect anomalies by modeling both local and global\ncontextual information. To make better use of hop counts for anomaly\nidentification, we propose to use hop counts prediction as a self-supervised\ntask. We design two anomaly scores based on the hop counts prediction via HCM\nmodel to identify anomalies. Besides, we employ Bayesian learning to train HCM\nmodel for capturing uncertainty in learned parameters and avoiding overfitting.\nExtensive experiments on real-world attributed networks demonstrate that our\nproposed model is effective in anomaly detection.",

However, such models\ndiscourage out-of-distribution generation to avoid spurious sample generation,\nlimiting their creativity. Thus, incorporating research on human creativity\ninto generative deep learning techniques presents an opportunity to make their\noutputs more compelling and human-like. As we see the emergence of generative\nmodels directed to creativity research, a need for machine learning-based\nsurrogate metrics to characterize creative output from these models is\nimperative. We propose group-based subset scanning to quantify, detect, and\ncharacterize creative processes by detecting a subset of anomalous\nnode-activations in the hidden layers of generative models. Our experiments on\noriginal, typically decoded, and \"creatively decoded\" (Das et al 2020) image\ndatasets reveal that the proposed subset scores distribution is more useful for\ndetecting creative processes in the activation space rather than the pixel\nspace. Further, we found that creative samples generate larger subsets of\nanomalies than normal or non-creative samples across datasets.

However,\nthese quantum algorithms, like their classical counterparts, have been shown to\nalso be vulnerable to input perturbations, in particular for classification\nproblems. These can arise either from noisy implementations or, as a worst-case\ntype of noise, adversarial attacks. In order to develop defence mechanisms and\nto better understand the reliability of these algorithms, it is crucial to\nunderstand their robustness properties in presence of natural noise sources or\nadversarial manipulation. From the observation that measurements involved in\nquantum classification algorithms are naturally probabilistic, we uncover and\nformalize a fundamental link between binary quantum hypothesis testing and\nprovably robust quantum classification. This link leads to a tight robustness\ncondition which puts constraints on the amount of noise a classifier can\ntolerate, independent of whether the noise source is natural or adversarial.\nBased on this result, we develop practical protocols to optimally certify\nrobustness. Finally, since this is a robustness condition against worst-case\ntypes of noise, our result naturally extends to scenarios where the noise\nsource is known.

          "description": "We investigate the discounting mismatch in actor-critic algorithm\nimplementations from a representation learning perspective. Theoretically,\nactor-critic algorithms usually have discounting for both actor and critic,\ni.e., there is a $\\gamma^t$ term in the actor update for the transition\nobserved at time $t$ in a trajectory and the critic is a discounted value\nfunction. Practitioners, however, usually ignore the discounting ($\\gamma^t$)\nfor the actor while using a discounted critic. We investigate this mismatch in\ntwo scenarios. In the first scenario, we consider optimizing an undiscounted\nobjective $(\\gamma = 1)$ where $\\gamma^t$ disappears naturally $(1^t = 1)$. We\nthen propose to interpret the discounting in critic in terms of a\nbias-variance-representation trade-off and provide supporting empirical\nresults. In the second scenario, we consider optimizing a discounted objective\n($\\gamma < 1$) and propose to interpret the omission of the discounting in the\nactor update from an auxiliary task perspective and provide supporting\nempirical results.",

Link prediction is often used as a proxy to evaluate the\nquality of these embeddings. Given that the creation of benchmarks for link\nprediction is a time-consuming endeavor, most work on the subject matter uses\nonly a few benchmarks. As benchmarks are crucial for the fair comparison of\nalgorithms, ensuring their quality is tantamount to providing a solid ground\nfor developing better solutions to link prediction and ipso facto embedding\nknowledge graphs. First studies of benchmarks pointed to limitations pertaining\nto information leaking from the development to the test fragments of some\nbenchmark datasets. We spotted a further common limitation of three of the\nbenchmarks commonly used for evaluating link prediction approaches:\nout-of-vocabulary entities in the test and validation sets. We provide an\nimplementation of an approach for spotting and removing such entities and\nprovide corrected versions of the datasets WN18RR, FB15K-237, and YAGO3-10. Our\nexperiments on the corrected versions of WN18RR, FB15K-237, and YAGO3-10\nsuggest that the measured performance of state-of-the-art approaches is altered\nsignificantly with p-values <1%, <1.4%, and <1%, respectively.

CASA follows the actor-critic framework that\nestimates state-value, state-action-value and policy simultaneously. We prove\nthat CASA integrates a consistent path for the policy evaluation and the policy\nimprovement, which completely eliminates the gradient conflict between the\npolicy improvement and the policy evaluation. The policy evaluation is\nequivalent to a compensational policy improvement, which alleviates the\nfunction approximation error, and is also equivalent to an entropy-regularized\npolicy improvement, which prevents the policy from being trapped into a\nsuboptimal solution. Building on this design, an expectation-correct Doubly\nRobust Trace is introduced to learn state-value and state-action-value, and the\nconvergence is guaranteed.

          "description": "With the success of the graph embedding model in both academic and industry\nareas, the robustness of graph embedding against adversarial attack inevitably\nbecomes a crucial problem in graph learning. Existing works usually perform the\nattack in a white-box fashion: they need to access the predictions/labels to\nconstruct their adversarial loss. However, the inaccessibility of\npredictions/labels makes the white-box attack impractical to a real graph\nlearning system. This paper promotes current frameworks in a more general and\nflexible sense -- we demand to attack various kinds of graph embedding models\nwith black-box driven. We investigate the theoretical connections between graph\nsignal processing and graph embedding models and formulate the graph embedding\nmodel as a general graph signal process with a corresponding graph filter.\nTherefore, we design a generalized adversarial attacker: GF-Attack. Without\naccessing any labels and model predictions, GF-Attack can perform the attack\ndirectly on the graph filter in a black-box fashion. We further prove that\nGF-Attack can perform an effective attack without knowing the number of layers\nof graph embedding models. To validate the generalization of GF-Attack, we\nconstruct the attacker on four popular graph embedding models. Extensive\nexperiments validate the effectiveness of GF-Attack on several benchmark\ndatasets.",

          "description": "We propose a new framework for computing the embeddings of large-scale graphs\non a single machine. A graph embedding is a fixed length vector representation\nfor each node (and/or edge-type) in a graph and has emerged as the de-facto\napproach to apply modern machine learning on graphs. We identify that current\nsystems for learning the embeddings of large-scale graphs are bottlenecked by\ndata movement, which results in poor resource utilization and inefficient\ntraining. These limitations require state-of-the-art systems to distribute\ntraining across multiple machines. We propose Marius, a system for efficient\ntraining of graph embeddings that leverages partition caching and buffer-aware\ndata orderings to minimize disk access and interleaves data movement with\ncomputation to maximize utilization. We compare Marius against two\nstate-of-the-art industrial systems on a diverse array of benchmarks. We\ndemonstrate that Marius achieves the same level of accuracy but is up to one\norder of magnitude faster. We also show that Marius can scale training to\ndatasets an order of magnitude beyond a single machine's GPU and CPU memory\ncapacity, enabling training of configurations with more than a billion edges\nand 550 GB of total parameters on a single machine with 16 GB of GPU memory and\n64 GB of CPU memory.

          "description": "This paper aims to put forward the concept that learning to take safe actions\nin unknown environments, even with probability one guarantees, can be achieved\nwithout the need for an unbounded number of exploratory trials, provided that\none is willing to navigate trade-offs between optimality, level of exposure to\nunsafe events, and the maximum detection time of unsafe actions. We illustrate\nthis concept in two complementary settings. We first focus on the canonical\nmulti-armed bandit problem and seek to study the intrinsic trade-offs of\nlearning safety in the presence of uncertainty. Under mild assumptions on\nsufficient exploration, we provide an algorithm that provably detects all\nunsafe machines in an (expected) finite number of rounds. The analysis also\nunveils a trade-off between the number of rounds needed to secure the\nenvironment and the probability of discarding safe machines. We then consider\nthe problem of finding optimal policies for a Markov Decision Process (MDP)\nwith almost sure constraints. We show that the (action) value function\nsatisfies a barrier-based decomposition which allows for the identification of\nfeasible policies independently of the reward process. Using this\ndecomposition, we develop a Barrier-learning algorithm, that identifies such\nunsafe state-action pairs in a finite expected number of steps. Our analysis\nfurther highlights a trade-off between the time lag for the underlying MDP\nnecessary to detect unsafe actions, and the level of exposure to unsafe events.\nSimulations corroborate our theoretical findings, further illustrating the\naforementioned trade-offs, and suggesting that safety constraints can further\nspeed up the learning process.",

This can be\nused for the verification of self-driving system performance without relying on\nexpensive and time-consuming road testing. In particular, we frame the\nsimulation problem as a Markov Process, leveraging deep neural networks to\nmodel both state distribution and transition function. These are trainable\ndirectly from the existing raw observations without the need for any\nhandcrafting in the form of plant or kinematic models. All that is needed is a\ndataset of historical traffic episodes. Our formulation allows the system to\nconstruct never seen scenes that unfold realistically reacting to the\nself-driving car's behaviour. We train our system directly from 1,000 hours of\ndriving logs and measure both realism, reactivity of the simulation as the two\nkey properties of the simulation. At the same time, we apply the method to\nevaluate the performance of a recently proposed state-of-the-art ML planning\nsystem trained from human driving logs. We discover this planning system is\nprone to previously unreported causal confusion issues that are difficult to\ntest by non-reactive simulation.

          "description": "With the recent advances of open-domain story generation, the lack of\nreliable automatic evaluation metrics becomes an increasingly imperative issue\nthat hinders the fast development of story generation. According to conducted\nresearches in this regard, learnable evaluation metrics have promised more\naccurate assessments by having higher correlations with human judgments. A\ncritical bottleneck of obtaining a reliable learnable evaluation metric is the\nlack of high-quality training data for classifiers to efficiently distinguish\nplausible and implausible machine-generated stories. Previous works relied on\n\\textit{heuristically manipulated} plausible examples to mimic possible system\ndrawbacks such as repetition, contradiction, or irrelevant content in the text\nlevel, which can be \\textit{unnatural} and \\textit{oversimplify} the\ncharacteristics of implausible machine-generated stories. We propose to tackle\nthese issues by generating a more comprehensive set of implausible stories\nusing {\\em plots}, which are structured representations of controllable factors\nused to generate stories. Since these plots are compact and structured, it is\neasier to manipulate them to generate text with targeted undesirable\nproperties, while at the same time maintain the grammatical correctness and\nnaturalness of the generated sentences. To improve the quality of generated\nimplausible stories, we further apply the adversarial filtering procedure\npresented by \\citet{zellers2018swag} to select a more nuanced set of\nimplausible texts. Experiments show that the evaluation metrics trained on our\ngenerated data result in more reliable automatic assessments that correlate\nremarkably better with human judgments compared to the baselines.",

Scalable kernel methods like Support Vector Machines may offer\ngood predictive performances but do not intrinsically provide uncertainty\nestimates. In contrast, probabilistic kernel methods like Gaussian Processes\noffer uncertainty estimates in addition to good predictive performance but fall\nshort in terms of scalability. While the scalability of Gaussian processes can\nbe improved using sparse inducing point approximations, the selection of these\ninducing points remains challenging. We explore different techniques for\nselecting inducing points on discrete domains, including greedy selection,\ndeterminantal point processes, and simulated annealing. We find that simulated\nannealing, which can select inducing points that are not in the training set,\ncan perform competitively with support vector machines and full Gaussian\nprocesses on synthetic data, as well as on challenging real-world DNA sequence\ndata.",

          "description": "The relationship between safety and optimality in control is not well\nunderstood, and they are often seen as important yet conflicting objectives.\nThere is a pressing need to formalize this relationship, especially given the\ngrowing prominence of learning-based methods. Indeed, it is common practice in\nreinforcement learning to simply modify reward functions by penalizing\nfailures, with the penalty treated as a mere heuristic. We rigorously examine\nthis relationship, and formalize the requirements for safe value functions:\nvalue functions that are both optimal for a given task, and enforce safety. We\nreveal the structure of this relationship through a proof of strong duality,\nshowing that there always exists a finite penalty that induces a safe value\nfunction. This penalty is not unique, but upper-unbounded: larger penalties do\nnot harm optimality. Although it is often not possible to compute the minimum\nrequired penalty, we reveal clear structure of how the penalty, rewards,\ndiscount factor, and dynamics interact. This insight suggests practical,\ntheory-guided heuristics to design reward functions for control problems where\nsafety is important.",

In this paper, we design a new explainable artificial intelligence\n(XAI) based deep learning framework in a federated setting for ECG-based\nhealthcare applications. The federated setting is used to solve issues such as\ndata availability and privacy concerns. Furthermore, the proposed framework\nsetting effectively classifies arrhythmia's using an autoencoder and a\nclassifier, both based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). Additionally,\nwe propose an XAI-based module on top of the proposed classifier to explain the\nclassification results, which help clinical practitioners make quick and\nreliable decisions. The proposed framework was trained and tested using the\nMIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. The classifier achieved accuracy up to 94% and 98%\nfor arrhythmia detection using noisy and clean data, respectively, with\nfive-fold cross-validation.",

          "description": "While many defences against adversarial examples have been proposed, finding\nrobust machine learning models is still an open problem. The most compelling\ndefence to date is adversarial training and consists of complementing the\ntraining data set with adversarial examples. Yet adversarial training severely\nimpacts training time and depends on finding representative adversarial\nsamples. In this paper we propose to train models on output spaces with large\nclass separation in order to gain robustness without adversarial training. We\nintroduce a method to partition the output space into class prototypes with\nlarge separation and train models to preserve it. Experimental results shows\nthat models trained with these prototypes -- which we call deep repulsive\nprototypes -- gain robustness competitive with adversarial training, while also\npreserving more accuracy on natural samples. Moreover, the models are more\nresilient to large perturbation sizes. For example, we obtained over 50%\nrobustness for CIFAR-10, with 92% accuracy on natural samples and over 20%\nrobustness for CIFAR-100, with 71% accuracy on natural samples without\nadversarial training. For both data sets, the models preserved robustness\nagainst large perturbations better than adversarially trained models.",

          "description": "We prove that the evidence lower bound (ELBO) employed by variational\nauto-encoders (VAEs) admits non-trivial solutions having constant posterior\nvariances under certain mild conditions, removing the need to learn variances\nin the encoder. The proof follows from an unexpected journey through an array\nof topics: the closed form optimal decoder for Gaussian VAEs, a proof that the\ndecoder is always smooth, a proof that the ELBO at its stationary points is\nequal to the exact log evidence, and the posterior variance is merely part of a\nstochastic estimator of the decoder Hessian. The penalty incurred from using a\nconstant posterior variance is small under mild conditions, and otherwise\ndiscourages large variations in the decoder Hessian. From here we derive a\nsimplified formulation of the ELBO as an expectation over a batch, which we\ncall the Batch Information Lower Bound (BILBO). Despite the use of Gaussians,\nour analysis is broadly applicable -- it extends to any likelihood function\nthat induces a Riemannian metric. Regarding learned likelihoods, we show that\nthe ELBO is optimal in the limit as the likelihood variances approach zero,\nwhere it is equivalent to the change of variables formulation employed in\nnormalizing flow networks. Standard optimization procedures are unstable in\nthis limit, so we propose a bounded Gaussian likelihood that is invariant to\nthe scale of the data using a measure of the aggregate information in a batch,\nwhich we call Bounded Aggregate Information Sampling (BAGGINS). Combining the\ntwo formulations, we construct VAE networks with only half the outputs of\nordinary VAEs (no learned variances), yielding improved ELBO scores and scale\ninvariance in experiments. As we perform our analyses irrespective of any\nparticular network architecture, our reformulations may apply to any VAE\nimplementation.",

We demonstrate that the submodular kernel drastically\nreduces the computational cost compared to state-of-the-art kernels and scales\nwell to large datasets while attaining good empirical performance.",

          "description": "Unstructured neural network pruning algorithms have achieved impressive\ncompression rates. However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse\nmatrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional\nmemory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of\nunstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning\nsolutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient\nimplementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a\nflexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different\ngranularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining\nefficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for\nevery output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature\nmap). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP\nleverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,\nfacilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive\ncompression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning\nmodels trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.\nRelevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization\nof pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the\nnetwork, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic\nmetrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within\na layer.",

In the context of clustering, metric\nlearning is typically applied with the assist of side-information provided by\nexperts, most commonly expressed in the form of cannot-link and must-link\nconstraints. In this setting, distance metric learning algorithms move closer\npairs of data points involved in must-link constraints, while pairs of points\ninvolved in cannot-link constraints are moved away from each other. For these\nalgorithms to be effective, it is important to use a distance metric that\nmatches the expert knowledge, beliefs, and expectations, and the\ntransformations made to stick to the side-information should preserve\ngeometrical properties of the dataset. Also, it is interesting to filter the\nconstraints provided by the experts to keep only the most useful and reject\nthose that can harm the clustering process.

Without any parameter-tuning, the same model achieves\nsuperior performance with Dice scores (0-100 scale) of over 80 for most of the\nbenchmarks, including the ones that are unseen during training. Our results\nshow generalizability of the proposed approach across data from different\nmachines and with different SOIs: a major use case of semi-automatic\nsegmentation methods where fully supervised approaches would normally struggle.\nThe source code will be made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/pakheiyeung/Sli2Vol.",

Research has found that web search activity can be used\nto improve influenza models. Neural networks (NN) can provide state-of-the-art\nforecasting accuracy but do not commonly incorporate uncertainty in their\nestimates, something essential for using them effectively during decision\nmaking. In this paper, we demonstrate how Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) can\nbe used to both provide a forecast and a corresponding uncertainty without\nsignificant loss in forecasting accuracy compared to traditional NNs. Our\nmethod accounts for two sources of uncertainty: data and model uncertainty,\narising due to measurement noise and model specification, respectively.\nExperiments are conducted using 14 years of data for England, assessing the\nmodel's accuracy over the last 4 flu seasons in this dataset. We evaluate the\nperformance of different models including competitive baselines with\nconventional metrics as well as error functions that incorporate uncertainty\nestimates. Our empirical analysis indicates that considering both sources of\nuncertainty simultaneously is superior to considering either one separately. We\nalso show that a BNN with recurrent layers that models both sources of\nuncertainty yields superior accuracy for these metrics for forecasting horizons\ngreater than 7 days.",

          "description": "Persistence diagrams have been widely used to quantify the underlying\nfeatures of filtered topological spaces in data visualization. In many\napplications, computing distances between diagrams is essential; however,\ncomputing these distances has been challenging due to the computational cost.\nIn this paper, we propose a persistence diagram hashing framework that learns a\nbinary code representation of persistence diagrams, which allows for fast\ncomputation of distances. This framework is built upon a generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN) with a diagram distance loss function to steer the learning\nprocess. Instead of attempting to transform diagrams into vectorized\nrepresentations, we hash diagrams into binary codes, which have natural\nadvantages in large-scale tasks. The training of this model is domain-oblivious\nin that it can be computed purely from synthetic, randomly created diagrams. As\na consequence, our proposed method is directly applicable to various datasets\nwithout the need of retraining the model. These binary codes, when compared\nusing fast Hamming distance, better maintain topological similarity properties\nbetween datasets than other vectorized representations. To evaluate this\nmethod, we apply our framework to the problem of diagram clustering and we\ncompare the quality and performance of our approach to the state-of-the-art. In\naddition, we show the scalability of our approach on a dataset with 10k\npersistence diagrams, which is not possible with current techniques.

We propose a new\nNLP Transformer context-sensitive visualization method that leverages existing\nNLP tools to find the most significant groups of tokens (words) that have the\ngreatest effect on the output, thus preserving some context from the original\ntext. First, we use a sentence-level dependency parser to highlight promising\nword groups. The dependency parser creates a tree of relationships between the\nwords in the sentence. Next, we systematically remove adjacent and non-adjacent\ntuples of \\emph{n} tokens from the input text, producing several new texts with\nthose tokens missing. The resulting texts are then passed to a pre-trained BERT\nmodel. The classification output is compared with that of the full text, and\nthe difference in the activation strength is recorded. The modified texts that\nproduce the largest difference in the target classification output neuron are\nselected, and the combination of removed words are then considered to be the\nmost influential on the model's output.

          "description": "Synonymous keyword retrieval has become an important problem for sponsored\nsearch ever since major search engines relax the exact match product's matching\nrequirement to a synonymous level. Since the synonymous relations between\nqueries and keywords are quite scarce, the traditional information retrieval\nframework is inefficient in this scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel\nquotient space-based retrieval framework to address this problem. Considering\nthe synonymy among keywords as a mathematical equivalence relation, we can\ncompress the synonymous keywords into one representative, and the corresponding\nquotient space would greatly reduce the size of the keyword repository. Then an\nembedding-based retrieval is directly conducted between queries and the keyword\nrepresentatives. To mitigate the semantic gap of the quotient space-based\nretrieval, a single semantic siamese model is utilized to detect both the\nkeyword--keyword and query-keyword synonymous relations. The experiments show\nthat with our quotient space-based retrieval method, the synonymous keyword\nretrieving performance can be greatly improved in terms of memory cost and\nrecall efficiency. This method has been successfully implemented in Baidu's\nonline sponsored search system and has yielded a significant improvement in\nrevenue.",

In this paper, we introduce the\nclass of Distributionally Optimistic Optimization (DOO) models, and show that\nit is always possible to \"beat\" SAA out-of-sample if we consider not just\nworst-case (DRO) models but also best-case (DOO) ones. We also show, however,\nthat this comes at a cost: Optimistic solutions are more sensitive to model\nerror than either worst-case or SAA optimizers, and hence are less robust.",

          "description": "Recently, deep neural network (DNN)-based speech enhancement (SE) systems\nhave been used with great success. During training, such systems require clean\nspeech data - ideally, in large quantity with a variety of acoustic conditions,\nmany different speaker characteristics and for a given sampling rate (e.g.,\n48kHz for fullband SE). However, obtaining such clean speech data is not\nstraightforward - especially, if only considering publicly available datasets.\nAt the same time, a lot of material for automatic speech recognition (ASR) with\nthe desired acoustic/speaker/sampling rate characteristics is publicly\navailable except being clean, i.e., it also contains background noise as this\nis even often desired in order to have ASR systems that are noise-robust.\nHence, using such data to train SE systems is not straightforward. In this\npaper, we propose two improvements to train SE systems on noisy speech data.\nFirst, we propose several modifications of the loss functions, which make them\nrobust against noisy speech targets. In particular, computing the median over\nthe sample axis before averaging over time-frequency bins allows to use such\ndata. Furthermore, we propose a noise augmentation scheme for mixture-invariant\ntraining (MixIT), which allows using it also in such scenarios. For our\nexperiments, we use the Mozilla Common Voice dataset and we show that using our\nrobust loss function improves PESQ by up to 0.19 compared to a system trained\nin the traditional way. Similarly, for MixIT we can see an improvement of up to\n0.27 in PESQ when using our proposed noise augmentation.",

However, this universality is limited: the density's support needs to\nbe diffeomorphic to a Euclidean space. In this paper, we propose a novel method\nto overcome this limitation without sacrificing universality. The proposed\nmethod inflates the data manifold by adding noise in the normal space, trains\nan NF on this inflated manifold, and, finally, deflates the learned density.\nOur main result provides sufficient conditions on the manifold and the specific\nchoice of noise under which the corresponding estimator is exact. Our method\nhas the same computational complexity as NFs and does not require computing an\ninverse flow. We also show that, if the embedding dimension is much larger than\nthe manifold dimension, noise in the normal space can be well approximated by\nGaussian noise. This allows to use our method for approximating arbitrary\ndensities on non-flat manifolds provided that the manifold dimension is known.",

          "description": "Increasingly, software is making autonomous decisions in case of criminal\nsentencing, approving credit cards, hiring employees, and so on. Some of these\ndecisions show bias and adversely affect certain social groups (e.g. those\ndefined by sex, race, age, marital status). Many prior works on bias mitigation\ntake the following form: change the data or learners in multiple ways, then see\nif any of that improves fairness. Perhaps a better approach is to postulate\nroot causes of bias and then applying some resolution strategy. This paper\npostulates that the root causes of bias are the prior decisions that affect-\n(a) what data was selected and (b) the labels assigned to those examples. Our\nFair-SMOTE algorithm removes biased labels; and rebalances internal\ndistributions such that based on sensitive attribute, examples are equal in\nboth positive and negative classes. On testing, it was seen that this method\nwas just as effective at reducing bias as prior approaches. Further, models\ngenerated via Fair-SMOTE achieve higher performance (measured in terms of\nrecall and F1) than other state-of-the-art fairness improvement algorithms. To\nthe best of our knowledge, measured in terms of number of analyzed learners and\ndatasets, this study is one of the largest studies on bias mitigation yet\npresented in the literature.",

We show that ReLU networks with\nanti-correlated weights can avoid this fate and have a chaotic phase where the\nsignal correlations saturate below unity. Consistent with this analysis, we\nfind that networks initialized with anti-correlated weights can train faster\n(in a teacher-student setting) by taking advantage of the increased\nexpressivity in the chaotic phase.

          "description": "Many recent approaches towards neural information retrieval mitigate their\ncomputational costs by using a multi-stage ranking pipeline. In the first\nstage, a number of potentially relevant candidates are retrieved using an\nefficient retrieval model such as BM25. Although BM25 has proven decent\nperformance as a first-stage ranker, it tends to miss relevant passages. In\nthis context we propose CoRT, a simple neural first-stage ranking model that\nleverages contextual representations from pretrained language models such as\nBERT to complement term-based ranking functions while causing no significant\ndelay at query time. Using the MS MARCO dataset, we show that CoRT\nsignificantly increases the candidate recall by complementing BM25 with missing\ncandidates.

          "description": "Analogy-making is at the core of human intelligence and creativity with\napplications to such diverse tasks as commonsense reasoning, learning, language\nacquisition, and story telling. This paper contributes to the foundations of\nartificial general intelligence by introducing from first principles an\nabstract algebraic framework of analogical proportions of the form `$a$ is to\n$b$ what $c$ is to $d$' in the general setting of universal algebra. This\nenables us to compare mathematical objects possibly across different domains in\na uniform way which is crucial for AI-systems. The main idea is to define\nsolutions to analogical equations in terms of maximal sets of algebraic\njustifications, which amounts to deriving abstract terms of concrete elements\nfrom a `known' source domain which can then be instantiated in an `unknown'\ntarget domain to obtain analogous elements. It turns out that our notion of\nanalogical proportions has appealing mathematical properties. For example, we\nshow that analogical proportions preserve functional dependencies across\ndifferent domains, which is desirable. We study Lepage's axioms of analogical\nproportions and argue why we disagree with his symmetry, central permutation,\nstrong reflexivity, and strong determinism axioms. We compare our framework\nwith two prominent and recently introduced frameworks of analogical proportions\nfrom the literature in the concrete domains of sets and numbers, and we show\nthat in each case we either disagree with the notion from the literature\njustified by some plausible counter-example or we can show that our model\nyields strictly more reasonable solutions. This provides evidence for its\napplicability.

          "description": "Tensor completion and robust principal component analysis have been widely\nused in machine learning while the key problem relies on the minimization of a\ntensor rank that is very challenging. A common way to tackle this difficulty is\nto approximate the tensor rank with the $\\ell_1-$norm of singular values based\non its Tensor Singular Value Decomposition (T-SVD). Besides, the sparsity of a\ntensor is also measured by its $\\ell_1-$norm. However, the $\\ell_1$ penalty is\nessentially biased and thus the result will deviate. In order to sidestep the\nbias, we propose a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate function and a novel\nnon-convex sparsity measure. In this new setting by using the concavity instead\nof the convexity, a majorization minimization algorithm is further designed for\ntensor completion and robust principal component analysis. Furthermore, we\nanalyze its theoretical properties. Finally, the experiments on natural and\nhyperspectral images demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed\nmethod.",

          "description": "Deep neural network (DNN) usually learns the target function from low to high\nfrequency, which is called frequency principle or spectral bias. This frequency\nprinciple sheds light on a high-frequency curse of DNNs -- difficult to learn\nhigh-frequency information. Inspired by the frequency principle, a series of\nworks are devoted to develop algorithms for overcoming the high-frequency\ncurse. A natural question arises: what is the upper limit of the decaying rate\nw.r.t. frequency when one trains a DNN? In this work, our theory, confirmed by\nnumerical experiments, suggests that there is a critical decaying rate w.r.t.\nfrequency in DNN training. Below the upper limit of the decaying rate, the DNN\ninterpolates the training data by a function with a certain regularity.\nHowever, above the upper limit, the DNN interpolates the training data by a\ntrivial function, i.e., a function is only non-zero at training data points.\nOur results indicate a better way to overcome the high-frequency curse is to\ndesign a proper pre-condition approach to shift high-frequency information to\nlow-frequency one, which coincides with several previous developed algorithms\nfor fast learning high-frequency information. More importantly, this work\nrigorously proves that the high-frequency curse is an intrinsic difficulty of\nDNNs.",

Recently, it has been argued that the\ndistribution of natural images do not lie in a single manifold but rather lie\nin a union of several submanifolds. We propose a sparsity-driven latent space\nsampling (SDLSS) framework and develop a proximal meta-learning (PML) algorithm\nto enforce sparsity in the latent space. SDLSS allows the range-space of the\ngenerator to be considered as a union-of-submanifolds. We also derive the\nsample complexity bounds within the SDLSS framework for the linear measurement\nmodel.

We first\nconsider a comparison between linear and nonlinear sensing mechanisms on\nFashion-MNIST dataset and show that the learned nonlinear version is superior\nto the linear one. Subsequent comparisons with the deep compressive sensing\n(DCS) framework proposed in the literature are reported. We also consider the\neffect of the dimension of the latent space and the sparsity factor in\nvalidating the SDLSS framework.

          "description": "The Graph Neural Network (GNN) has achieved remarkable success in graph data\nrepresentation. However, the previous work only considered the ideal balanced\ndataset, and the practical imbalanced dataset was rarely considered, which, on\nthe contrary, is of more significance for the application of GNN. Traditional\nmethods such as resampling, reweighting and synthetic samples that deal with\nimbalanced datasets are no longer applicable in GNN. Ensemble models can handle\nimbalanced datasets better compared with single estimator. Besides, ensemble\nlearning can achieve higher estimation accuracy and has better reliability\ncompared with the single estimator. In this paper, we propose an ensemble model\ncalled AdaGCN, which uses a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) as the base\nestimator during adaptive boosting. In AdaGCN, a higher weight will be set for\nthe training samples that are not properly classified by the previous\nclassifier, and transfer learning is used to reduce computational cost and\nincrease fitting capability. Experiments show that the AdaGCN model we proposed\nachieves better performance than GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, N-GCN and the most of\nadvanced reweighting and resampling methods on synthetic imbalanced datasets,\nwith an average improvement of 4.3%. Our model also improves state-of-the-art\nbaselines on all of the challenging node classification tasks we consider:\nCora, Citeseer, Pubmed, and NELL.",

          "description": "Large amounts of threat intelligence information about malware attacks are\navailable in disparate, typically unstructured, formats. Knowledge graphs can\ncapture this information and its context using RDF triples represented by\nentities and relations. Sparse or inaccurate threat information, however, leads\nto challenges such as incomplete or erroneous triples. Generic information\nextraction (IE) models used to populate the knowledge graph cannot fully\nguarantee domain-specific context. This paper proposes a system to generate a\nMalware Knowledge Graph called MalKG, the first open-source automated knowledge\ngraph for malware threat intelligence. MalKG dataset (MT40K\\footnote{ Anonymous\nGitHub link: https://github.com/malkg-researcher/MalKG}) contains approximately\n40,000 triples generated from 27,354 unique entities and 34 relations. For\nground truth, we manually curate a knowledge graph called MT3K, with 3,027\ntriples generated from 5,741 unique entities and 22 relations. We demonstrate\nthe intelligence prediction of MalKG using two use cases. Predicting malware\nthreat information using the benchmark model achieves 80.4 for the hits@10\nmetric (predicts the top 10 options for an information class), and 0.75 for the\nMRR (mean reciprocal rank). We also propose an automated, contextual framework\nfor information extraction, both manually and automatically, at the sentence\nlevel from 1,100 malware threat reports and from the common vulnerabilities and\nexposures (CVE) database.",

With the\nreal-world power grids of Great Britain, Spain, France, and Germany, we also\ndemonstrate that the machine learning algorithms trained on synthetic power\ngrids are transferable to the stability prediction of the real-world power\ngrids, which implies the prospective applicability of machine learning\ntechniques on power-grid studies.",

          "description": "The gloabal objective of inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is to estimate\nthe unknown cost function of some MDP base on observed trajectories generated\nby (approximate) optimal policies. The classical approach consists in tuning\nthis cost function so that associated optimal trajectories (that minimise the\ncumulative discounted cost, i.e. the classical RL loss) are 'similar' to the\nobserved ones. Prior contributions focused on penalising degenerate solutions\nand improving algorithmic scalability. Quite orthogonally to them, we question\nthe pertinence of characterising optimality with respect to the cumulative\ndiscounted cost as it induces an implicit bias against policies with longer\nmixing times. State of the art value based RL algorithms circumvent this issue\nby solving for the fixed point of the Bellman optimality operator, a stronger\ncriterion that is not well defined for the inverse problem. To alleviate this\nbias in IRL, we introduce an alternative training loss that puts more weights\non future states which yields a reformulation of the (maximum entropy) IRL\nproblem. The algorithms we devised exhibit enhanced performances (and similar\ntractability) than off-the-shelf ones in multiple OpenAI gym environments.",

However, HAC is notoriously hard to scale\nto large data sets as the underlying complexity is at least quadratic in the\nnumber of data points and many algorithms to solve HAC are inherently\nsequential. In this paper, we propose {Reciprocal Agglomerative Clustering\n(RAC)}, a distributed algorithm for HAC, that uses a novel strategy to\nefficiently merge clusters in parallel. We prove theoretically that RAC\nrecovers the exact solution of HAC. Furthermore, under clusterability and\nbalancedness assumption we show provable speedups in total runtime due to the\nparallelism. We also show that these speedups are achievable for certain\nprobabilistic data models. In extensive experiments, we show that this\nparallelism is achieved on real world data sets and that the proposed RAC\nalgorithm can recover the HAC hierarchy on billions of data points connected by\ntrillions of edges in less than an hour.",

We show that consistent estimation is possible with nearly linear\nsample size and inverse-polynomial inlier fraction.

One proof is phrased in terms of strong convexity, extending\nwork of [Tsakonas et al.'14], and particularly short. The other proof\nhighlights a connection between the Huber loss estimator and high-dimensional\nmedian computations. In the special case of Gaussian designs, this connection\nleads us to a strikingly simple algorithm based on computing coordinate-wise\nmedians that achieves optimal guarantees in nearly-linear time, and that can\nexploit sparsity of $\\beta^*$.

In this work, we reexamine the inter-related\nproblems of \"topic identification\" and \"text segmentation\" for sparse document\nlearning, when there is a single new text of interest. In developing a\nmethodology to handle single documents, we face two major challenges. First is\nsparse information: with access to only one document, we cannot train\ntraditional topic models or deep learning algorithms. Second is significant\nnoise: a considerable portion of words in any single document will produce only\nnoise and not help discern topics or segments. To tackle these issues, we\ndesign an unsupervised, computationally efficient methodology called BATS:\nBiclustering Approach to Topic modeling and Segmentation. BATS leverages three\nkey ideas to simultaneously identify topics and segment text: (i) a new\nmechanism that uses word order information to reduce sample complexity, (ii) a\nstatistically sound graph-based biclustering technique that identifies latent\nstructures of words and sentences, and (iii) a collection of effective\nheuristics that remove noise words and award important words to further improve\nperformance.

In particular, this work focuses on\nestimating the forward reachable set of closed-loop systems with NN\ncontrollers. Recent work provides bounds on these reachable sets, yet the\ncomputationally efficient approaches provide overly conservative bounds (thus\ncannot be used to verify useful properties), whereas tighter methods are too\nintensive for online computation. This work bridges the gap by formulating a\nconvex optimization problem for reachability analysis for closed-loop systems\nwith NN controllers. While the solutions are less tight than prior semidefinite\nprogram-based methods, they are substantially faster to compute, and some of\nthe available computation time can be used to refine the bounds through input\nset partitioning, which more than overcomes the tightness gap. The proposed\nframework further considers systems with measurement and process noise, thus\nbeing applicable to realistic systems with uncertainty. Finally, numerical\ncomparisons show $10\\times$ reduction in conservatism in $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the\ncomputation time compared to the state-of-the-art, and the ability to handle\nvarious sources of uncertainty is highlighted on a quadrotor model.",

Due to more compatible and complementary\ninformation from multiple views, existing multi-view methods could achieve more\npromising performance than conventional single-view methods in most situations.\nHowever, there are still no sufficient researches on the unified framework in\nexisting multi-view works. Meanwhile, how to efficiently integrate multi-view\ninformation is still full of challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmulti-view learning framework, which aims to leverage most existing graph\nembedding works into a unified formula via introducing the graph consensus\nterm. In particular, our method explores the graph structure in each view\nindependently to preserve the diversity property of graph embedding methods.\nMeanwhile, we choose heterogeneous graphs to construct the graph consensus term\nto explore the correlations among multiple views jointly. To this end, the\ndiversity and complementary information among different views could be\nsimultaneously considered. Furthermore, the proposed framework is utilized to\nimplement the multi-view extension of Locality Linear Embedding, named\nMulti-view Locality Linear Embedding (MvLLE), which could be efficiently solved\nby applying the alternating optimization strategy. Empirical validations\nconducted on six benchmark datasets can show the effectiveness of our proposed\nmethod.",

          "description": "Logistic regression remains one of the most widely used tools in applied\nstatistics, machine learning and data science. However, in moderately\nhigh-dimensional problems, where the number of features $d$ is a non-negligible\nfraction of the sample size $n$, the logistic regression maximum likelihood\nestimator (MLE), and statistical procedures based the large-sample\napproximation of its distribution, behave poorly. Recently, Sur and Cand\\`es\n(2019) showed that these issues can be corrected by applying a new\napproximation of the MLE's sampling distribution in this high-dimensional\nregime. Unfortunately, these corrections are difficult to implement in\npractice, because they require an estimate of the \\emph{signal strength}, which\nis a function of the underlying parameters $\\beta$ of the logistic regression.\nTo address this issue, we propose SLOE, a fast and straightforward approach to\nestimate the signal strength in logistic regression. The key insight of SLOE is\nthat the Sur and Cand\\`es (2019) correction can be reparameterized in terms of\nthe \\emph{corrupted signal strength}, which is only a function of the estimated\nparameters $\\widehat \\beta$. We propose an estimator for this quantity, prove\nthat it is consistent in the relevant high-dimensional regime, and show that\ndimensionality correction using SLOE is accurate in finite samples. Compared to\nthe existing ProbeFrontier heuristic, SLOE is conceptually simpler and orders\nof magnitude faster, making it suitable for routine use. We demonstrate the\nimportance of routine dimensionality correction in the Heart Disease dataset\nfrom the UCI repository, and a genomics application using data from the UK\nBiobank. We provide an open source package for this method, available at\n\\url{https://github.com/google-research/sloe-logistic}.",

          "description": "To develop and train defect prediction models, researchers rely on datasets\nin which a defect is attributed to an artifact, e.g., a class of a given\nrelease. However, the creation of such datasets is far from being perfect. It\ncan happen that a defect is discovered several releases after its introduction:\nthis phenomenon has been called \"dormant defects\". This means that, if we\nobserve today the status of a class in its current version, it can be\nconsidered as defect-free while this is not the case. We call \"snoring\" the\nnoise consisting of such classes, affected by dormant defects only. We\nconjecture that the presence of snoring negatively impacts the classifiers'\naccuracy and their evaluation. Moreover, earlier releases likely contain more\nsnoring classes than older releases, thus, removing the most recent releases\nfrom a dataset could reduce the snoring effect and improve the accuracy of\nclassifiers. In this paper we investigate the impact of the snoring noise on\nclassifiers' accuracy and their evaluation, and the effectiveness of a possible\ncountermeasure consisting in removing the last releases of data. We analyze the\naccuracy of 15 machine learning defect prediction classifiers on data from more\nthan 4,000 bugs and 600 releases of 19 open source projects from the Apache\necosystem. Our results show that, on average across projects: (i) the presence\nof snoring decreases the recall of defect prediction classifiers; (ii)\nevaluations affected by snoring are likely unable to identify the best\nclassifiers, and (iii) removing data from recent releases helps to\nsignificantly improve the accuracy of the classifiers. On summary, this paper\nprovides insights on how to create a software defect dataset by mitigating the\neffect of snoring.",

          "description": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) play a key role in deep learning\napplications. However, the large storage overheads and the substantial\ncomputation cost of CNNs are problematic in hardware accelerators.\nComputing-in-memory (CIM) architecture has demonstrated great potential to\neffectively compute large-scale matrix-vector multiplication. However, the\nintensive multiply and accumulation (MAC) operations executed at the crossbar\narray and the limited capacity of CIM macros remain bottlenecks for further\nimprovement of energy efficiency and throughput. To reduce computation costs,\nnetwork pruning and quantization are two widely studied compression methods to\nshrink the model size. However, most of the model compression algorithms can\nonly be implemented in digital-based CNN accelerators. For implementation in a\nstatic random access memory (SRAM) CIM-based accelerator, the model compression\nalgorithm must consider the hardware limitations of CIM macros, such as the\nnumber of word lines and bit lines that can be turned on at the same time, as\nwell as how to map the weight to the SRAM CIM macro. In this study, a software\nand hardware co-design approach is proposed to design an SRAM CIM-based CNN\naccelerator and an SRAM CIM-aware model compression algorithm. To lessen the\nhigh-precision MAC required by batch normalization (BN), a quantization\nalgorithm that can fuse BN into the weights is proposed. Furthermore, to reduce\nthe number of network parameters, a sparsity algorithm that considers a CIM\narchitecture is proposed.

          "description": "Automatic lesion segmentation on thoracic CT enables rapid quantitative\nanalysis of lung involvement in COVID- 19 infections. Obtaining voxel-level\nannotations for training segmentation networks is prohibitively expensive.\nTherefore we propose a weakly-supervised segmentation method based on dense\nregression activation maps (dRAM). Most advanced weakly supervised segmentation\napproaches exploit class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects generated\nfrom high-level semantic features at a coarse resolution. As a result, CAMs\nprovide coarse outlines that do not align precisely with the object\nsegmentations. Instead, we exploit dense features from a segmentation network\nto compute dense regression activation maps (dRAMs) for preserving local\ndetails. During training, dRAMs are pooled lobe-wise to regress the per-lobe\nlesion percentage. In such a way, the network achieves additional information\nregarding the lesion quantification in comparison with the classification\napproach. Furthermore, we refine dRAMs based on an attention module and dense\nconditional random field trained together with the main regression task. The\nrefined dRAMs are served as the pseudo labels for training a final segmentation\nnetwork. When evaluated on 69 CT scans, our method substantially improves the\nintersection over union from 0.335 in the CAM-based weakly supervised\nsegmentation method to 0.495.",

However, on the one hand, FM fails to capture higher-order feature\ninteractions suffering from combinatorial expansion, on the other hand, taking\ninto account interaction between every pair of features may introduce noise and\ndegrade prediction accuracy. To solve the problems, we propose a novel approach\nGraph Factorization Machine (GraphFM) by naturally representing features in the\ngraph structure. In particular, a novel mechanism is designed to select the\nbeneficial feature interactions and formulate them as edges between features.\nThen our proposed model which integrates the interaction function of FM into\nthe feature aggregation strategy of Graph Neural Network (GNN), can model\narbitrary-order feature interactions on the graph-structured features by\nstacking layers.

However, traditional\nmulti-party learning approaches are confronted with obstacles such as system\nheterogeneity, statistical heterogeneity, and incentive design. How to deal\nwith these challenges and further improve the efficiency and performance of\nmulti-party learning has become an urgent problem to be solved. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel contrastive multi-party learning framework for knowledge\nrefinement and sharing with an accountable incentive mechanism. Since the\nexisting naive model parameter averaging method is contradictory to the\nlearning paradigm of neural networks, we simulate the process of human\ncognition and communication, and analogy multi-party learning as a many-to-one\nknowledge sharing problem. The approach is capable of integrating the acquired\nexplicit knowledge of each client in a transparent manner without privacy\ndisclosure, and it reduces the dependence on data distribution and\ncommunication environments.

          "description": "Deep learning is gaining increasing popularity for spatiotemporal\nforecasting. However, prior works have mostly focused on point estimates\nwithout quantifying the uncertainty of the predictions. In high stakes domains,\nbeing able to generate probabilistic forecasts with confidence intervals is\ncritical to risk assessment and decision making. Hence, a systematic study of\nuncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for spatiotemporal forecasting is\nmissing in the community. In this paper, we describe two types of\nspatiotemporal forecasting problems: regular grid-based and graph-based. Then\nwe analyze UQ methods from both the Bayesian and the frequentist point of view,\ncasting in a unified framework via statistical decision theory. Through\nextensive experiments on real-world road network traffic, epidemics, and air\nquality forecasting tasks, we reveal the statistical and computational\ntrade-offs for different UQ methods: Bayesian methods are typically more robust\nin mean prediction, while confidence levels obtained from frequentist methods\nprovide more extensive coverage over data variations. Computationally, quantile\nregression type methods are cheaper for a single confidence interval but\nrequire re-training for different intervals. Sampling based methods generate\nsamples that can form multiple confidence intervals, albeit at a higher\ncomputational cost.",

The case in which unobserved variables have a widespread effect on\nmany of the observed ones is particularly difficult because most pairs of\nvariables are conditionally dependent given any other subset, rendering the\ncausal effect unidentifiable. In this paper we show that beyond conditional\nindependencies, under the principle of independent mechanisms, unobserved\nconfounding in this setting leaves a statistical footprint in the observed data\ndistribution that allows for disentangling spurious and causal effects. Using\nthis insight, we demonstrate that a sparse linear Gaussian directed acyclic\ngraph among observed variables may be recovered approximately and propose an\nadjusted score-based causal discovery algorithm that may be implemented with\ngeneral purpose solvers and scales to high-dimensional problems.

In this work, a relatively straightforward\nmethod is introduced to address this problem. Two variants of the approach are\npresented. First requires aligned examples from multiple devices, the second\napproach alleviates this requirement. This method works for both time and\nfrequency domain representations of audio recordings. Further, a relation to\nstandardization and Cepstral Mean Subtraction is analysed. The proposed\napproach becomes effective even when very few examples are provided. This\nmethod was developed during the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes\nand Events (DCASE) 2019 challenge and won the 1st place in the scenario with\nmis-matched recording devices with the accuracy of 75%.

Shapley effects are now widely used to interpret both tree ensembles and\nneural networks, as they can efficiently handle dependence and interactions in\nthe data, as opposed to most other variable importance measures. However,\nestimating Shapley effects is a challenging task, because of the computational\ncomplexity and the conditional expectation estimates. Accordingly, existing\nShapley algorithms have flaws: a costly running time, or a bias when input\nvariables are dependent. Therefore, we introduce SHAFF, SHApley eFfects via\nrandom Forests, a fast and accurate Shapley effect estimate, even when input\nvariables are dependent.

The problem can be approached by using either\nengineered time-frequency features or raw audio as input. Modulation filter\nbank representations that have been actively researched as a basis for timbre\nperception have the potential to facilitate the extraction of perceptually\nsalient features. We explore end-to-end learned front-ends for audio\nrepresentation learning, ModNet and SincModNet, that incorporate a temporal\nmodulation processing block. The structure is effectively analogous to a\nmodulation filter bank, where the FIR filter center frequencies are learned in\na data-driven manner. The expectation is that a perceptually motivated filter\nbank can provide a useful representation for identifying music features. Our\nexperimental results provide a fully visualisable and interpretable front-end\ntemporal modulation decomposition of raw audio. We evaluate the performance of\nour model against the state-of-the-art of music tagging on the MagnaTagATune\ndataset. We analyse the impact on performance for particular tags when\ntime-frequency bands are subsampled by the modulation filters at a\nprogressively reduced rate.

We further show that the phase transition is task\nand model dependent -- as model size becomes larger and training data set\nbecomes smaller, the transition becomes more pronounced. Our experiments on the\nGLUE benchmark show that the super tickets improve single task fine-tuning by\n$0.9$ points on BERT-base and $1.0$ points on BERT-large, in terms of\ntask-average score.

          "description": "Cluster algorithms are increasingly popular in biomedical research due to\ntheir compelling ability to identify discrete subgroups in data, and their\nincreasing accessibility in mainstream software. While guidelines exist for\nalgorithm selection and outcome evaluation, there are no firmly established\nways of computing a priori statistical power for cluster analysis. Here, we\nestimated power and accuracy for common analysis pipelines through simulation.\nWe varied subgroup size, number, separation (effect size), and covariance\nstructure. We then subjected generated datasets to dimensionality reduction\n(none, multidimensional scaling, or UMAP) and cluster algorithms (k-means,\nagglomerative hierarchical clustering with Ward or average linkage and\nEuclidean or cosine distance, HDBSCAN). Finally, we compared the statistical\npower of discrete (k-means), \"fuzzy\" (c-means), and finite mixture modelling\napproaches (which include latent profile and latent class analysis). We found\nthat outcomes were driven by large effect sizes or the accumulation of many\nsmaller effects across features, and were unaffected by differences in\ncovariance structure. Sufficient statistical power was achieved with relatively\nsmall samples (N=20 per subgroup), provided cluster separation is large\n({\\Delta}=4). Fuzzy clustering provided a more parsimonious and powerful\nalternative for identifying separable multivariate normal distributions,\nparticularly those with slightly lower centroid separation ({\\Delta}=3).\nOverall, we recommend that researchers 1) only apply cluster analysis when\nlarge subgroup separation is expected, 2) aim for sample sizes of N=20 to N=30\nper expected subgroup, 3) use multidimensional scaling to improve cluster\nseparation, and 4) use fuzzy clustering or finite mixture modelling approaches\nthat are more powerful and more parsimonious with partially overlapping\nmultivariate normal distributions.",

The recent advances in the\nfield of machine learning is efficient to predict these interactions between\nabnormal human phenotypes and genes.\n\nMethods In this study, we developed a framework to predict links between\nhuman phenotype ontology (HPO) and genes. The annotation data from the\nheterogeneous knowledge resources i.e., orphanet, is used to parse human\nphenotype-gene associations. To generate the embeddings for the nodes (HPO &\ngenes), an algorithm called node2vec was used. It performs node sampling on\nthis graph based on random walks, then learns features over these sampled nodes\nto generate embeddings. These embeddings were used to perform the downstream\ntask to predict the presence of the link between these nodes using 5 different\nsupervised machine learning algorithms.\n\nResults: The downstream link prediction task shows that the Gradient Boosting\nDecision Tree based model (LightGBM) achieved an optimal AUROC 0.904 and AUCPR\n0.784.

          "description": "Deep neural networks offer numerous potential applications across geoscience,\nfor example, one could argue that they are the state-of-the-art method for\npredicting faults in seismic datasets. In quantitative reservoir\ncharacterization workflows, it is common to incorporate the uncertainty of\npredictions thus such subsurface models should provide calibrated probabilities\nand the associated uncertainties in their predictions. It has been shown that\npopular Deep Learning-based models are often miscalibrated, and due to their\ndeterministic nature, provide no means to interpret the uncertainty of their\npredictions. We compare three different approaches to obtaining probabilistic\nmodels based on convolutional neural networks in a Bayesian formalism, namely\nDeep Ensembles, Concrete Dropout, and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian\n(SWAG). These methods are consistently applied to fault detection case studies\nwhere Deep Ensembles use independently trained models to provide fault\nprobabilities, Concrete Dropout represents an extension to the popular Dropout\ntechnique to approximate Bayesian neural networks, and finally, we apply SWAG,\na recent method that is based on the Bayesian inference equivalence of\nmini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent. We provide quantitative results in\nterms of model calibration and uncertainty representation, as well as\nqualitative results on synthetic and real seismic datasets. Our results show\nthat the approximate Bayesian methods, Concrete Dropout and SWAG, both provide\nwell-calibrated predictions and uncertainty attributes at a lower computational\ncost when compared to the baseline Deep Ensemble approach.

The asymptotic\nexpression of our objective then reveals the dependence of the MISE on the\ntraining density, enabling analytic minimization. As a result, we obtain the\noptimal training density in a closed-form.

          "description": "Manifold learning is used for dimensionality reduction, with the goal of\nfinding a projection subspace to increase and decrease the inter- and\nintraclass variances, respectively. However, a bottleneck for subspace learning\nmethods often arises from the high dimensionality of datasets. In this paper, a\nhierarchical approach is proposed to scale subspace learning methods, with the\ngoal of improving classification in large datasets by a range of 3% to 10%.\nDifferent combinations of methods are studied. We assess the proposed method on\nfive publicly available large datasets, for different eigen-value based\nsubspace learning methods such as linear discriminant analysis, principal\ncomponent analysis, generalized discriminant analysis, and reconstruction\nindependent component analysis. To further examine the effect of the proposed\nmethod on various classification methods, we fed the generated result to linear\ndiscriminant analysis, quadratic linear analysis, k-nearest neighbor, and\nrandom forest classifiers. The resulting classification accuracies are compared\nto show the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach, reporting results of an\naverage of 5% increase in classification accuracy.",

          "description": "Modelling, simulation, and forecasting offer a means of facilitating better\nplanning and decision-making. These quantitative approaches can add value\nbeyond traditional methods that do not rely on data and are particularly\nrelevant for public transportation. Lagos is experiencing rapid urbanization\nand currently has a population of just under 15 million. Both long waiting\ntimes and uncertain travel times has driven many people to acquire their own\nvehicle or use alternative modes of transport. This has significantly increased\nthe number of vehicles on the roads leading to even more traffic and greater\ntraffic congestion. This paper investigates urban travel demand in Lagos and\nexplores passenger dynamics in time and space. Using individual commuter trip\ndata from tickets purchased from the Lagos State Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), the\ndemand patterns through the hours of the day, days of the week and bus stations\nare analysed. This study aims to quantify demand from actual passenger trips\nand estimate the impact that dynamic scheduling could have on passenger waiting\ntimes. Station segmentation is provided to cluster stations by their demand\ncharacteristics in order to tailor specific bus schedules. Intra-day public\ntransportation demand in Lagos BRT is analysed and predictions are compared.\nSimulations using fixed and dynamic bus scheduling demonstrate that the average\nwaiting time could be reduced by as much as 80%. The load curves, insights and\nthe approach developed will be useful for informing policymaking in Lagos and\nsimilar African cities facing the challenges of rapid urbanization.",

          "description": "Special-purpose Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are utilised for\nbenthic (seafloor) surveys, where the vehicle collects optical imagery of near\nthe seafloor. Due to the small-sensor footprint of the cameras and the vast\nareas to be surveyed, these AUVs can not feasibly full coverage of areas larger\nthan a few tens of thousands of square meters. Therefore AUV paths which sample\nsparsely, yet effectively, the survey areas are necessary. Broad scale acoustic\nbathymetric data is ready available over large areas, and often is a useful\nprior of seafloor cover. As such, prior bathymetry can be used to guide AUV\ndata collection. This research proposes methods for planning initial AUV\nsurveys that efficiently explore a feature space representation of the\nbathymetry, in order to sample from a diverse set of bathymetric terrain. This\nwill enable the AUV to visit areas that likely contain unique habitats and are\nrepresentative of the entire survey site. The suitability of these methods to\nplan AUV surveys is evaluated based on the coverage of the feature space and\nalso the ability to visit all classes of benthic habitat on the initial dive.\nThis is a valuable tool for AUV surveys as it increases the utility of initial\ndives. It also delivers a comprehensive training set to learn a relationship\nbetween acoustic bathymetry and visually-derived seafloor classifications.",

          "description": "Satellite remote sensing is playing an increasing role in the rapid mapping\nof damage after natural disasters. In particular, synthetic aperture radar\n(SAR) can image the Earth's surface and map damage in all weather conditions,\nday and night. However, current SAR damage mapping methods struggle to separate\ndamage from other changes in the Earth's surface. In this study, we propose a\nnovel approach to damage mapping, combining deep learning with the full time\nhistory of SAR observations of an impacted region in order to detect anomalous\nvariations in the Earth's surface properties due to a natural disaster. We\nquantify Earth surface change using time series of Interferometric SAR\ncoherence, then use a recurrent neural network (RNN) as a probabilistic anomaly\ndetector on these coherence time series. The RNN is first trained on pre-event\ncoherence time series, and then forecasts a probability distribution of the\ncoherence between pre- and post-event SAR images. The difference between the\nforecast and observed co-event coherence provides a measure of the confidence\nin the identification of damage. The method allows the user to choose a damage\ndetection threshold that is customized for each location, based on the local\nbehavior of coherence through time before the event. We apply this method to\ncalculate estimates of damage for three earthquakes using multi-year time\nseries of Sentinel-1 SAR acquisitions. Our approach shows good agreement with\nobserved damage and quantitative improvement compared to using pre- to co-event\ncoherence loss as a damage proxy.",

          "description": "4D seismic imaging has been widely used in CO$_2$ sequestration projects to\nmonitor the fluid flow in the volumetric subsurface region that is not sampled\nby wells. Ideally, real-time monitoring and near-future forecasting would\nprovide site operators with great insights to understand the dynamics of the\nsubsurface reservoir and assess any potential risks. However, due to obstacles\nsuch as high deployment cost, availability of acquisition equipment, exclusion\nzones around surface structures, only very sparse seismic imaging data can be\nobtained during monitoring. That leads to an unavoidable and growing knowledge\ngap over time. The operator needs to understand the fluid flow throughout the\nproject lifetime and the seismic data are only available at a limited number of\ntimes, this is insufficient for understanding the reservoir behavior. To\novercome those challenges, we have developed spatio-temporal\nneural-network-based models that can produce high-fidelity interpolated or\nextrapolated images effectively and efficiently. Specifically, our models are\nbuilt on an autoencoder, and incorporate the long short-term memory (LSTM)\nstructure with a new loss function regularized by optical flow. We validate the\nperformance of our models using real 4D post-stack seismic imaging data\nacquired at the Sleipner CO$_2$ sequestration field. We employ two different\nstrategies in evaluating our models. Numerically, we compare our models with\ndifferent baseline approaches using classic pixel-based metrics. We also\nconduct a blind survey and collect a total of 20 responses from domain experts\nto evaluate the quality of data generated by our models.

          "description": "Autonomous discovery and direct instruction are two extreme sources of\nlearning in children, but educational sciences have shown that intermediate\napproaches such as assisted discovery or guided play resulted in better\nacquisition of skills. When turning to Artificial Intelligence, the above\ndichotomy is translated into the distinction between autonomous agents which\nlearn in isolation and interactive learning agents which can be taught by\nsocial partners but generally lack autonomy. In between should stand teachable\nautonomous agents: agents learning from both internal and teaching signals to\nbenefit from the higher efficiency of assisted discovery. Such agents could\nlearn on their own in the real world, but non-expert users could drive their\nlearning behavior towards their expectations. More fundamentally, combining\nboth capabilities might also be a key step towards general intelligence. In\nthis paper we elucidate obstacles along this research line. First, we build on\na seminal work of Bruner to extract relevant features of the assisted discovery\nprocesses. Second, we describe current research on autotelic agents, i.e.\nagents equipped with forms of intrinsic motivations that enable them to\nrepresent, self-generate and pursue their own goals. We argue that autotelic\ncapabilities are paving the way towards teachable and autonomous agents.\nFinally, we adopt a social learning perspective on tutoring interactions and we\nhighlight some components that are currently missing to autotelic agents before\nthey can be taught by ordinary people using natural pedagogy, and we provide a\nlist of specific research questions that emerge from this perspective.",

          "description": "Reinforcement learning (RL)-based neural architecture search (NAS) generally\nguarantees better convergence yet suffers from the requirement of huge\ncomputational resources compared with gradient-based approaches, due to the\nrollout bottleneck -- exhaustive training for each sampled generation on proxy\ntasks. In this paper, we propose a general pipeline to accelerate the\nconvergence of the rollout process as well as the RL process in NAS. It is\nmotivated by the interesting observation that both the architecture and the\nparameter knowledge can be transferred between different experiments and even\ndifferent tasks. We first introduce an uncertainty-aware critic (value\nfunction) in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to utilize the architecture\nknowledge in previous experiments, which stabilizes the training process and\nreduces the searching time by 4 times. Further, an architecture knowledge pool\ntogether with a block similarity function is proposed to utilize parameter\nknowledge and reduces the searching time by 2 times. It is the first to\nintroduce block-level weight sharing in RLbased NAS. The block similarity\nfunction guarantees a 100% hitting ratio with strict fairness. Besides, we show\nthat a simply designed off-policy correction factor used in \"replay buffer\" in\nRL optimization can further reduce half of the searching time. Experiments on\nthe Mobile Neural Architecture Search (MNAS) search space show the proposed\nFast Neural Architecture Search (FNAS) accelerates standard RL-based NAS\nprocess by ~10x (e.g. ~256 2x2 TPUv2 x days / 20,000 GPU x hour -> 2,000 GPU x\nhour for MNAS), and guarantees better performance on various vision tasks.",

This is the\nstrength of DL but also one of its key limitations when applied to science and\nengineering problems in which underlying physical properties (such as\nstability, conservation, and positivity) and desired accuracy need to be\nachieved. DL methods in their original forms are not capable of respecting the\nunderlying mathematical models or achieving desired accuracy even in big-data\nregimes. On the other hand, many data-driven science and engineering problems,\nsuch as inverse problems, typically have limited experimental or observational\ndata, and DL would overfit the data in this case.

In particular,\ndeep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently been employed to train DNNs that\nact as control policies for various types of real-world systems. In this work,\nwe present the whiRL 2.0 tool, which implements a new approach for verifying\ncomplex properties of interest for such DRL systems. To demonstrate the\nbenefits of whiRL 2.0, we apply it to case studies from the communication\nnetworks domain that have recently been used to motivate formal verification of\nDRL systems, and which exhibit characteristics that are conducive for scalable\nverification. We propose techniques for performing k-induction and automated\ninvariant inference on such systems, and use these techniques for proving\nsafety and liveness properties of interest that were previously impossible to\nverify due to the scalability barriers of prior approaches. Furthermore, we\nshow how our proposed techniques provide insights into the inner workings and\nthe generalizability of DRL systems. whiRL 2.0 is publicly available online.",

In this paper, we present an end-to-end\ndeep learning approach that combines recurrent neural networks (RNNs) within\nthe training strategy of variational autoencoders (VAEs) with a binary\nrepresentation of the latent space. We apply a reparametrization trick for the\nBernoulli distribution for the discrete representations, which allows smooth\nbackpropagation. In addition, our approach allows the separation of the encoder\nand decoder, which is necessary for compression tasks.

The\nmost efficient way to train deep SNNs is through ANN-SNN conversion. However,\nthe conversion usually suffers from accuracy loss and long inference time,\nwhich impede the practical application of SNN. In this paper, we theoretically\nanalyze ANN-SNN conversion and derive sufficient conditions of the optimal\nconversion. To better correlate ANN-SNN and get greater accuracy, we propose\nRate Norm Layer to replace the ReLU activation function in source ANN training,\nenabling direct conversion from a trained ANN to an SNN. Moreover, we propose\nan optimal fit curve to quantify the fit between the activation value of source\nANN and the actual firing rate of target SNN. We show that the inference time\ncan be reduced by optimizing the upper bound of the fit curve in the revised\nANN to achieve fast inference. Our theory can explain the existing work on fast\nreasoning and get better results. The experimental results show that the\nproposed method achieves near loss less conversion with VGG-16,\nPreActResNet-18, and deeper structures. Moreover, it can reach 8.6x faster\nreasoning performance under 0.265x energy consumption of the typical method.\nThe code is available at\nhttps://github.com/DingJianhao/OptSNNConvertion-RNL-RIL.",

          "description": "Few-Shot Learning (FSL) algorithms have made substantial progress in learning\nnovel concepts with just a handful of labelled data. To classify query\ninstances from novel classes encountered at test-time, they only require a\nsupport set composed of a few labelled samples. FSL benchmarks commonly assume\nthat those queries come from the same distribution as instances in the support\nset. However, in a realistic set-ting, data distribution is plausibly subject\nto change, a situation referred to as Distribution Shift (DS). The present work\naddresses the new and challenging problem of Few-Shot Learning under\nSupport/Query Shift (FSQS) i.e., when support and query instances are sampled\nfrom related but different distributions. Our contributions are the following.\nFirst, we release a testbed for FSQS, including datasets, relevant baselines\nand a protocol for a rigorous and reproducible evaluation. Second, we observe\nthat well-established FSL algorithms unsurprisingly suffer from a considerable\ndrop in accuracy when facing FSQS, stressing the significance of our study.\nFinally, we show that transductive algorithms can limit the inopportune effect\nof DS. In particular, we study both the role of Batch-Normalization and Optimal\nTransport (OT) in aligning distributions, bridging Unsupervised Domain\nAdaptation with FSL. This results in a new method that efficiently combines OT\nwith the celebrated Prototypical Networks. We bring compelling experiments\ndemonstrating the advantage of our method. Our work opens an exciting line of\nresearch by providing a testbed and strong baselines. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/ebennequin/meta-domain-shift.",

          "description": "The abundance of training data is not guaranteed in various supervised\nlearning applications. One of these situations is the post-earthquake regional\ndamage assessment of buildings. Querying the damage label of each building\nrequires a thorough inspection by experts, and thus, is an expensive task. A\npractical approach is to sample the most informative buildings in a sequential\nlearning scheme. Active learning methods recommend the most informative cases\nthat are able to maximally reduce the generalization error. The information\ntheoretic measure of mutual information (MI) is one of the most effective\ncriteria to evaluate the effectiveness of the samples in a pool-based sample\nselection scenario. However, the computational complexity of the standard MI\nalgorithm prevents the utilization of this method on large datasets. A local\nkernels strategy was proposed to reduce the computational costs, but the\nadaptability of the kernels to the observed labels was not considered in the\noriginal formulation of this strategy. In this article, an adaptive local\nkernels methodology is developed that allows for the conformability of the\nkernels to the observed output data while enhancing the computational\ncomplexity of the standard MI algorithm. The proposed algorithm is developed to\nwork on a Gaussian process regression (GPR) framework, where the kernel\nhyperparameters are updated after each label query using the maximum likelihood\nestimation. In the sequential learning procedure, the updated hyperparameters\ncan be used in the MI kernel matrices to improve the sample suggestion\nperformance. The advantages are demonstrated on a simulation of the 2018\nAnchorage, AK, earthquake. It is shown that while the proposed algorithm\nenables GPR to reach acceptable performance with fewer training data, the\ncomputational demands remain lower than the standard local kernels strategy.",

It reuses prior knowledge from other tasks to\npre-train networks for new tasks. In reinforcement learning, learning actions\nfor a behavior policy that can be applied to new environments is still a\nchallenge, especially for tasks that involve much planning. Sokoban is a\nchallenging puzzle game. It has been used widely as a benchmark in\nplanning-based reinforcement learning. In this paper, we show how prior\nknowledge improves learning in Sokoban tasks. We find that reusing feature\nrepresentations learned previously can accelerate learning new, more complex,\ninstances. In effect, we show how curriculum learning, from simple to complex\ntasks, works in Sokoban. Furthermore, feature representations learned in\nsimpler instances are more general, and thus lead to positive transfers towards\nmore complex tasks, but not vice versa. We have also studied which part of the\nknowledge is most important for transfer to succeed, and identify which layers\nshould be used for pre-training.",

          "description": "The proliferation of optical, electron, and scanning probe microscopies gives\nrise to large volumes of imaging data of objects as diversified as cells,\nbacteria, pollen, to nanoparticles and atoms and molecules. In most cases, the\nexperimental data streams contain images having arbitrary rotations and\ntranslations within the image. At the same time, for many cases, small amounts\nof labeled data are available in the form of prior published results, image\ncollections, and catalogs, or even theoretical models. Here we develop an\napproach that allows generalizing from a small subset of labeled data with a\nweak orientational disorder to a large unlabeled dataset with a much stronger\norientational (and positional) disorder, i.e., it performs a classification of\nimage data given a small number of examples even in the presence of a\ndistribution shift between the labeled and unlabeled parts. This approach is\nbased on the semi-supervised rotationally invariant variational autoencoder\n(ss-rVAE) model consisting of the encoder-decoder \"block\" that learns a\nrotationally (and translationally) invariant continuous latent representation\nof data and a classifier that encodes data into a finite number of discrete\nclasses. The classifier part of the trained ss-rVAE inherits the rotational\n(and translational) invariances and can be deployed independently of the other\nparts of the model.

          "description": "Stroke order and velocity are helpful features in the fields of signature\nverification, handwriting recognition, and handwriting synthesis. Recovering\nthese features from offline handwritten text is a challenging and well-studied\nproblem. We propose a new model called TRACE (Trajectory Recovery by an\nAdaptively-trained Convolutional Encoder). TRACE is a differentiable approach\nthat uses a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) to infer temporal\nstroke information from long lines of offline handwritten text with many\ncharacters and dynamic time warping (DTW) to align predictions and ground truth\npoints. TRACE is perhaps the first system to be trained end-to-end on entire\nlines of text of arbitrary width and does not require the use of dynamic\nexemplars. Moreover, the system does not require images to undergo any\npre-processing, nor do the predictions require any post-processing.\nConsequently, the recovered trajectory is differentiable and can be used as a\nloss function for other tasks, including synthesizing offline handwritten text.\n\nWe demonstrate that temporal stroke information recovered by TRACE from\noffline data can be used for handwriting synthesis and establish the first\nbenchmarks for a stroke trajectory recovery system trained on the IAM online\nhandwriting dataset.",

As a reference metric, we\ncalculate the ROUGE scores between the input paragraphs and each sentence in\nthe generated summary, which indicate source origin information via text\nsimilarity. We observe a high correlation between the attention weights and\nthis reference metric, especially on the the later decoding layers of the\ntransformer architecture.

For financial gain, companies pay fraudsters preferably in groups to\ndemote or promote products and services since consumers are more likely to be\nmisled by a large number of similar reviews from groups. Recent approaches on\nfraudster group detection employed handcrafted features of group behaviors\nwithout considering the semantic relation between reviews from the reviewers in\na group. In this paper, we propose the first neural approach, HIN-RNN, a\nHeterogeneous Information Network (HIN) Compatible RNN for fraudster group\ndetection that requires no handcrafted features. HIN-RNN provides a unifying\narchitecture for representation learning of each reviewer, with the initial\nvector as the sum of word embeddings of all review text written by the same\nreviewer, concatenated by the ratio of negative reviews. Given a co-review\nnetwork representing reviewers who have reviewed the same items with the same\nratings and the reviewers' vector representation, a collaboration matrix is\nacquired through HIN-RNN training. The proposed approach is confirmed to be\neffective with marked improvement over state-of-the-art approaches on both the\nYelp (22% and 12% in terms of recall and F1-value, respectively) and Amazon (4%\nand 2% in terms of recall and F1-value, respectively) datasets.",

For linear classifiers, we show that a sparsifying front end is\nprovably effective against $\\ell_{\\infty}$-bounded attacks, reducing output\ndistortion due to the attack by a factor of roughly $K/N$ where $N$ is the data\ndimension and $K$ is the sparsity level.

          "description": "Federated learning (FL), as a distributed machine learning paradigm, promotes\npersonal privacy by local data processing at each client. However, relying on a\ncentralized server for model aggregation, standard FL is vulnerable to server\nmalfunctions, untrustworthy server, and external attacks. To address this\nissue, we propose a decentralized FL framework by integrating blockchain into\nFL, namely, blockchain assisted decentralized federated learning (BLADE-FL). In\na round of the proposed BLADE-FL, each client broadcasts the trained model to\nother clients, aggregates its own model with received ones, and then competes\nto generate a block before its local training of the next round. We evaluate\nthe learning performance of BLADE-FL, and develop an upper bound on the global\nloss function. Then we verify that this bound is convex with respect to the\nnumber of overall aggregation rounds K, and optimize the computing resource\nallocation for minimizing the upper bound. We also note that there is a\ncritical problem of training deficiency, caused by lazy clients who plagiarize\nothers' trained models and add artificial noises to disguise their cheating\nbehaviors. Focusing on this problem, we explore the impact of lazy clients on\nthe learning performance of BLADE-FL, and characterize the relationship among\nthe optimal K, the learning parameters, and the proportion of lazy clients.\nBased on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, we show that the experimental\nresults are consistent with the analytical ones. To be specific, the gap\nbetween the developed upper bound and experimental results is lower than 5%,\nand the optimized K based on the upper bound can effectively minimize the loss\nfunction.",

This method\nis based on the divide and conquer principle, in which the problem space is\ndivided between several experts by supervisition of gating network. In this\npaper, we propose an ensemble learning method based on mixture of experts which\nis named mixture of ELM based experts with trainable gating network (MEETG) to\nimprove the computing cost and to speed up the learning process of ME. The\nstructure of ME consists of multi layer perceptrons (MLPs) as base experts and\ngating network, in which gradient-based learning algorithm is applied for\ntraining the MLPs which is an iterative and time consuming process. In order to\novercome on these problems, we use the advantages of extreme learning machine\n(ELM) for designing the structure of ME. ELM as a learning algorithm for single\nhidden-layer feed forward neural networks provides much faster learning process\nand better generalization ability in comparision with some other traditional\nlearning algorithms. Also, in the proposed method a trainable gating network is\napplied to aggregate the outputs of the experts dynamically according to the\ninput sample. Our experimental results and statistical analysis on 11 benchmark\ndatasets confirm that MEETG has an acceptable performance in classification\nproblems. Furthermore, our experimental results show that the proposed approach\noutperforms the original ELM on prediction stability and classification\naccuracy.",

In addition to value maximization, other\npractical considerations arise commonly as well, including the need of\nencouraging exploration, and that of ensuring certain structural properties of\nthe learned policy due to safety, resource and operational constraints. These\nconsiderations can often be accounted for by resorting to regularized RL, which\naugments the target value function with a structure-promoting regularization\nterm.\n\nFocusing on an infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision process, this\npaper proposes a generalized policy mirror descent (GPMD) algorithm for solving\nregularized RL. As a generalization of policy mirror descent Lan (2021), the\nproposed algorithm accommodates a general class of convex regularizers as well\nas a broad family of Bregman divergence in cognizant of the regularizer in use.\nWe demonstrate that our algorithm converges linearly over an entire range of\nlearning rates, in a dimension-free fashion, to the global solution, even when\nthe regularizer lacks strong convexity and smoothness. In addition, this linear\nconvergence feature is provably stable in the face of inexact policy evaluation\nand imperfect policy updates.

Moreover, a given labeler\nmay exhibit different labeling accuracies for different instances. This setting\ncan be referred to as active learning with diverse labelers with varying costs\nand accuracies, and it arises in many important real settings. It is therefore\nbeneficial to understand how to effectively trade-off between labeling accuracy\nfor different instances, labeling costs, as well as the informativeness of\ntraining instances, so as to achieve the best generalization performance at the\nlowest labeling cost. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for selecting\ninstances, labelers (and their corresponding costs and labeling accuracies),\nthat employs generalization bound of learning with label noise to select\ninformative instances and labelers so as to achieve higher generalization\naccuracy at a lower cost.

It is very important to test and isolate people to reduce\nspread, and from here comes the need to do this quickly and efficiently.\nAccording to some studies, Chest-CT outperforms RT-PCR lab testing, which is\nthe current standard, when diagnosing COVID-19 patients. Due to this, computer\nvision researchers have developed various deep learning systems that can\npredict COVID-19 using a Chest-CT scan correctly to a certain degree. The\naccuracy of these systems is limited since deep learning neural networks such\nas CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) need a significantly large quantity of\ndata for training in order to produce good quality results. Since the disease\nis relatively recent and more focus has been on CXR (Chest XRay) images, the\navailable chest CT Scan image dataset is much less. We propose a method, by\nutilizing GANs, to generate synthetic chest CT images of both positive and\nnegative COVID-19 patients. Using a pre-built predictive model, we concluded\nthat around 40% of the generated images are correctly predicted as COVID-19\npositive.

To\nthat end, we propose a new, active deep learning method to estimate oil palm\ndensity at large scale from Sentinel-2 satellite images, and apply it to\ngenerate complete maps for Malaysia and Indonesia. What makes the regression of\noil palm density challenging is the need for representative reference data that\ncovers all relevant geographical conditions across a large territory.\nSpecifically for density estimation, generating reference data involves\ncounting individual trees. To keep the associated labelling effort low we\npropose an active learning (AL) approach that automatically chooses the most\nrelevant samples to be labelled. Our method relies on estimates of the\nepistemic model uncertainty and of the diversity among samples, making it\npossible to retrieve an entire batch of relevant samples in a single iteration.\nMoreover, our algorithm has linear computational complexity and is easily\nparallelisable to cover large areas. We use our method to compute the first oil\npalm density map with $10\\,$m Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) , for all of\nIndonesia and Malaysia and for two different years, 2017 and 2019.

As we observe an increasing interest\nin these models in the dermatology space, it is crucial to address aspects such\nas the robustness towards input data distribution shifts. Current skin disease\nmodels could make incorrect inferences for test samples from different hardware\ndevices and clinical settings or unknown disease samples, which are\nout-of-distribution (OOD) from the training samples.To this end, we propose a\nsimple yet effective approach that detect these OOD samples prior to making any\ndecision. The detection is performed via scanning in the latent space\nrepresentation (e.g., activations of the inner layers of any pre-trained skin\ndisease classifier). The input samples could also perturbed to maximise\ndivergence of OOD samples. We validate our ODD detection approach in two use\ncases: 1) identify samples collected from different protocols, and 2) detect\nsamples from unknown disease classes. Additionally, we evaluate the performance\nof the proposed approach and compare it with other state-of-the-art methods.\nFurthermore, data-driven dermatology applications may deepen the disparity in\nclinical care across racial and ethnic groups since most datasets are reported\nto suffer from bias in skin tone distribution. Therefore, we also evaluate the\nfairness of these OOD detection methods across different skin tones. Our\nexperiments resulted in competitive performance across multiple datasets in\ndetecting OOD samples, which could be used (in the future) to design more\neffective transfer learning techniques prior to inferring on these samples.",

          "description": "Deep learning models are widely used for image analysis. While they offer\nhigh performance in terms of accuracy, people are concerned about if these\nmodels inappropriately make inferences using irrelevant features that are not\nencoded from the target object in a given image. To address the concern, we\npropose a metamorphic testing approach that assesses if a given inference is\nmade based on irrelevant features. Specifically, we propose two novel\nmetamorphic relations to detect such inappropriate inferences. We applied our\napproach to 10 image classification models and 10 object detection models, with\nthree large datasets, i.e., ImageNet, COCO, and Pascal VOC. Over 5.3% of the\ntop-5 correct predictions made by the image classification models are subject\nto inappropriate inferences using irrelevant features. The corresponding rate\nfor the object detection models is over 8.5%. Based on the findings, we further\ndesigned a new image generation strategy that can effectively attack existing\nmodels. Comparing with a baseline approach, our strategy can double the success\nrate of attacks.",

Existing works fail to trade off short-term and\nlong-term prediction performances and extract robust latent dynamics laws in\nvideo frames. We propose a two-branch seq-to-seq deep model to disentangle the\nTaylor feature and the residual feature in video frames by a novel recurrent\nprediction module (TaylorCell) and residual module. TaylorCell can expand the\nvideo frames' high-dimensional features into the finite Taylor series to\ndescribe the latent laws. In TaylorCell, we propose the Taylor prediction unit\n(TPU) and the memory correction unit (MCU). TPU employs the first input frame's\nderivative information to predict the future frames, avoiding error\naccumulation. MCU distills all past frames' information to correct the\npredicted Taylor feature from TPU. Correspondingly, the residual module\nextracts the residual feature complementary to the Taylor feature. On three\ngeneralist datasets (Moving MNIST, TaxiBJ, Human 3.6), our model outperforms or\nreaches state-of-the-art models, and ablation experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our model in long-term prediction.",

          "description": "In this paper, we propose a Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBM) to forecast\ndominant wave periods in oceanic waters. First, we use the data collected from\nCDIP buoys and apply various data filtering methods. The data filtering methods\nallow us to obtain a high-quality dataset for training and validation purposes.\nWe then extract various wave-based features like wave heights, periods,\nskewness, kurtosis, etc., and atmospheric features like humidity, pressure, and\nair temperature for the buoys. Afterward, we train algorithms that use LightGBM\nand Extra Trees through a hv-block cross-validation scheme to forecast dominant\nwave periods for up to 30 days ahead. LightGBM has the R2 score of 0.94, 0.94,\nand 0.94 for 1-day ahead, 15-day ahead, and 30-day ahead prediction. Similarly,\nExtra Trees (ET) has an R2 score of 0.88, 0.86, and 0.85 for 1-day ahead,\n15-day ahead, and 30 day ahead prediction. In case of the test dataset,\nLightGBM has R2 score of 0.94, 0.94, and 0.94 for 1-day ahead, 15-day ahead and\n30-day ahead prediction. ET has R2 score of 0.88, 0.86, and 0.85 for 1-day\nahead, 15-day ahead, and 30-day ahead prediction. A similar R2 score for both\ntraining and the test dataset suggests that the machine learning models\ndeveloped in this paper are robust. Since the LightGBM algorithm outperforms ET\nfor all the windows tested, it is taken as the final algorithm. Note that the\nperformance of both methods does not decrease significantly as the forecast\nhorizon increases. Likewise, the proposed method outperforms the numerical\napproaches included in this paper in the test dataset.

Recently, rigorous results that point to reducing the\nfunctional complexity of the map that describes the dynamics in the new phase\nhave made the Koopman operator based approach very attractive for data-driven\nmodeling.

We use driven dynamical\nsystems comparable to that in reservoir computing with the \\emph{causal\nembedding property} to obtain the right set of observables through which the\ndynamics in the new space is made equivalent or topologically conjugate to the\noriginal system. Deep learning methods are used to learn a map that emerges as\na consequence of the topological conjugacy.

          "description": "As most of the modern astronomical sky surveys produce data faster than\nhumans can analyze it, Machine Learning (ML) has become a central tool in\nAstronomy. Modern ML methods can be characterized as highly resistant to some\nexperimental errors. However, small changes on the data over long distances or\nlong periods of time, which cannot be easily detected by statistical methods,\ncan be harmful to these methods. We develop a new strategy to cope with this\nproblem, also using ML methods in an innovative way, to identify these\npotentially harmful features. We introduce and discuss the notion of Drifting\nFeatures, related with small changes in the properties as measured in the data\nfeatures. We use the identification of RRLs in VVV based on an earlier work and\nintroduce a method for detecting Drifting Features. Our method forces a\nclassifier to learn the tile of origin of diverse sources (mostly stellar\n'point sources'), and select the features more relevant to the task of finding\ncandidates to Drifting Features. We show that this method can efficiently\nidentify a reduced set of features that contains useful information about the\ntile of origin of the sources. For our particular example of detecting RRLs in\nVVV, we find that Drifting Features are mostly related to color indices. On the\nother hand, we show that, even if we have a clear set of Drifting Features in\nour problem, they are mostly insensitive to the identification of RRLs.\nDrifting Features can be efficiently identified using ML methods. However, in\nour example, removing Drifting Features does not improve the identification of\nRRLs.",

The commonly used strategies for Node Embedding Dimension\nSelection (NEDS) based on grid search or empirical knowledge suffer from heavy\ncomputation and poor model performance. In this paper, we revisit NEDS from the\nperspective of minimum entropy principle. Subsequently, we propose a novel\nMinimum Graph Entropy (MinGE) algorithm for NEDS with graph data. To be\nspecific, MinGE considers both feature entropy and structure entropy on graphs,\nwhich are carefully designed according to the characteristics of the rich\ninformation in them. The feature entropy, which assumes the embeddings of\nadjacent nodes to be more similar, connects node features and link topology on\ngraphs. The structure entropy takes the normalized degree as basic unit to\nfurther measure the higher-order structure of graphs. Based on them, we design\nMinGE to directly calculate the ideal node embedding dimension for any graph.\nFinally, comprehensive experiments with popular Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our\nproposed MinGE.",

TSE can be considered a spatiotemporal\ninterpolation problem in which the evolution of traffic variables (e.g.,\nspeed/density) is governed by traffic flow dynamics (e.g., partial differential\nequations). Most existing TSE methods either rely on well-defined physical\ntraffic flow models or require large amounts of simulation data as input to\ntrain machine learning models. Different from previous studies, in this paper\nwe propose a purely data-driven and model-free solution. We consider TSE as a\nspatiotemporal matrix completion/interpolation problem, and apply\nspatiotemporal Hankel delay embedding to transforms the original incomplete\nmatrix to a fourth-order tensor. By imposing a low-rank assumption on this\ntensor structure, we can approximate and characterize both global patterns and\nthe unknown and complex local spatiotemporal dynamics in a data-driven manner.\nWe use the truncated nuclear norm of the spatiotemporal unfolding (i.e., square\nnorm) to approximate the tensor rank and develop an efficient solution\nalgorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The\nproposed framework only involves two hyperparameters -- spatial and temporal\nwindow lengths, which are easy to set given the degree of data sparsity. We\nconduct numerical experiments on both synthetic simulation data and real-world\nhigh-resolution trajectory data, and our results demonstrate the effectiveness\nand superiority of the proposed model in some challenging scenarios.",

          "description": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is critical for industrial recommender\nsystems, where most deep CTR models follow an Embedding \\& Feature Interaction\nparadigm. However, the majority of methods focus on designing network\narchitectures to better capture feature interactions while the feature\nembedding, especially for numerical features, has been overlooked. Existing\napproaches for numerical features are difficult to capture informative\nknowledge because of the low capacity or hard discretization based on the\noffline expertise feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a novel\nembedding learning framework for numerical features in CTR prediction (AutoDis)\nwith high model capacity, end-to-end training and unique representation\nproperties preserved. AutoDis consists of three core components:\nmeta-embeddings, automatic discretization and aggregation. Specifically, we\npropose meta-embeddings for each numerical field to learn global knowledge from\nthe perspective of field with a manageable number of parameters. Then the\ndifferentiable automatic discretization performs soft discretization and\ncaptures the correlations between the numerical features and meta-embeddings.\nFinally, distinctive and informative embeddings are learned via an aggregation\nfunction. Comprehensive experiments on two public and one industrial datasets\nare conducted to validate the effectiveness of AutoDis. Moreover, AutoDis has\nbeen deployed onto a mainstream advertising platform, where online A/B test\ndemonstrates the improvement over the base model by 2.1% and 2.7% in terms of\nCTR and eCPM, respectively. In addition, the code of our framework is publicly\navailable in\nMindSpore(https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/tree/master/model_zoo/research/recommend/autodis).",

          "description": "Solving tasks with sparse rewards is one of the most important challenges in\nreinforcement learning. In the single-agent setting, this challenge is\naddressed by introducing intrinsic rewards that motivate agents to explore\nunseen regions of their state spaces; however, applying these techniques\nnaively to the multi-agent setting results in agents exploring independently,\nwithout any coordination among themselves. Exploration in cooperative\nmulti-agent settings can be accelerated and improved if agents coordinate their\nexploration. In this paper we introduce a framework for designing intrinsic\nrewards which consider what other agents have explored such that the agents can\ncoordinate. Then, we develop an approach for learning how to dynamically select\nbetween several exploration modalities to maximize extrinsic rewards.\nConcretely, we formulate the approach as a hierarchical policy where a\nhigh-level controller selects among sets of policies trained on diverse\nintrinsic rewards and the low-level controllers learn the action policies of\nall agents under these specific rewards. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed approach in cooperative domains with sparse rewards where\nstate-of-the-art methods fail and challenging multi-stage tasks that\nnecessitate changing modes of coordination.",

However, the images of different\nfine-grained objects tend to merely exhibit subtle differences in appearance,\nwhich will severely deteriorate zero-shot object recognition. To reduce the\nsuperfluous information in the fine-grained objects, in this paper, we propose\nto learn the redundancy-free features for generalized zero-shot learning. We\nachieve our motivation by projecting the original visual features into a new\n(redundancy-free) feature space and then restricting the statistical dependence\nbetween these two feature spaces. Furthermore, we require the projected\nfeatures to keep and even strengthen the category relationship in the\nredundancy-free feature space.

          "description": "Tackling binary program analysis problems has traditionally implied manually\ndefining rules and heuristics, a tedious and time-consuming task for human\nanalysts. In order to improve automation and scalability, we propose an\nalternative direction based on distributed representations of binary programs\nwith applicability to a number of downstream tasks. We introduce Bin2vec, a new\napproach leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) along with computational\nprogram graphs in order to learn a high dimensional representation of binary\nexecutable programs. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach by using\nour representations to solve two semantically different binary analysis tasks -\nfunctional algorithm classification and vulnerability discovery. We compare the\nproposed approach to our own strong baseline as well as published results and\ndemonstrate improvement over state-of-the-art methods for both tasks. We\nevaluated Bin2vec on 49191 binaries for the functional algorithm classification\ntask, and on 30 different CWE-IDs including at least 100 CVE entries each for\nthe vulnerability discovery task. We set a new state-of-the-art result by\nreducing the classification error by 40% compared to the source-code-based\ninst2vec approach, while working on binary code. For almost every vulnerability\nclass in our dataset, our prediction accuracy is over 80% (and over 90% in\nmultiple classes).",

We use accessible\nfeatures of the equities pricing data to construct a non-deterministic Markov\ndecision process for modeling stock price behavior driven by principal\ninvestor's decision making. However, low signal-to-noise ratio and instability\nthat appear immanent in equity markets pose challenges to determine the state\ntransition (price change) after executing an action (principal investor's\ndecision) as well as decide an action based on current state (spot price).

In this paper, we address\nthis problem from three aspects by devising an efficient network structure,\nproposing three effective training strategies, and exploiting four useful\npostprocessing techniques. First, we find that context information plays an\nimportant role in reasoning human body configuration and invisible keypoints.\nInspired by this, we propose a cascaded context mixer (CCM), which efficiently\nintegrates spatial and channel context information and progressively refines\nthem. Then, to maximize CCM's representation capability, we develop a\nhard-negative person detection mining strategy and a joint-training strategy by\nexploiting abundant unlabeled data. It enables CCM to learn discriminative\nfeatures from massive diverse poses. Third, we present several sub-pixel\nrefinement techniques for postprocessing keypoint predictions to improve\ndetection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the MS COCO keypoint detection\nbenchmark demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over\nrepresentative state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our single model achieves\ncomparable performance with the winner of the 2018 COCO Keypoint Detection\nChallenge. The final ensemble model sets a new SOTA on this benchmark.",

We consider that we have a set of `one-class classification'\nobjective-tasks with only a small set of positive examples available for each\ntask, and a set of training tasks with full supervision (i.e. highly imbalanced\nclassification). We propose an approach using order-equivariant networks to\nlearn a 'meta' binary-classifier. The model will take as input an example to\nclassify from a given task, as well as the corresponding supervised set of\npositive examples for this OCC task. Thus, the output of the model will be\n'conditioned' on the available positive example of a given task, allowing to\npredict on new tasks and new examples without labeled negative examples. In\nthis paper, we are motivated by an astronomy application. Our goal is to\nidentify if stars belong to a specific stellar group (the 'one-class' for a\ngiven task), called \\textit{stellar streams}, where each stellar stream is a\ndifferent OCC-task. We show that our method transfers well on unseen (test)\nsynthetic streams, and outperforms the baselines even though it is not\nretrained and accesses a much smaller part of the data per task to predict\n(only positive supervision). We see however that it doesn't transfer as well on\nthe real stream GD-1. This could come from intrinsic differences from the\nsynthetic and real stream, highlighting the need for consistency in the\n'nature' of the task for this method.

          "description": "Recent works have proposed methods to train classifiers with local robustness\nproperties, which can provably eliminate classes of evasion attacks for most\ninputs, but not all inputs. Since data distribution shift is very common in\nsecurity applications, e.g., often observed for malware detection, local\nrobustness cannot guarantee that the property holds for unseen inputs at the\ntime of deploying the classifier. Therefore, it is more desirable to enforce\nglobal robustness properties that hold for all inputs, which is strictly\nstronger than local robustness.\n\nIn this paper, we present a framework and tools for training classifiers that\nsatisfy global robustness properties. We define new notions of global\nrobustness that are more suitable for security classifiers. We design a novel\nbooster-fixer training framework to enforce global robustness properties. We\nstructure our classifier as an ensemble of logic rules and design a new\nverifier to verify the properties. In our training algorithm, the booster\nincreases the classifier's capacity, and the fixer enforces verified global\nrobustness properties following counterexample guided inductive synthesis.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the only global robustness property that has\nbeen previously achieved is monotonicity. Several previous works have defined\nglobal robustness properties, but their training techniques failed to achieve\nverified global robustness. In comparison, we show that we can train\nclassifiers to satisfy different global robustness properties for three\nsecurity datasets, and even multiple properties at the same time, with modest\nimpact on the classifier's performance. For example, we train a Twitter spam\naccount classifier to satisfy five global robustness properties, with 5.4%\ndecrease in true positive rate, and 0.1% increase in false positive rate,\ncompared to a baseline XGBoost model that doesn't satisfy any property.",

Via\nextensive experiments, we find that (1) random alignment matrices surprisingly\nperform quite competitively and (2) learning attention weights from token-token\n(query-key) interactions is useful but not that important after all. To this\nend, we propose \\textsc{Synthesizer}, a model that learns synthetic attention\nweights without token-token interactions. In our experiments, we first show\nthat simple Synthesizers achieve highly competitive performance when compared\nagainst vanilla Transformer models across a range of tasks, including machine\ntranslation, language modeling, text generation and GLUE/SuperGLUE benchmarks.\nWhen composed with dot product attention, we find that Synthesizers\nconsistently outperform Transformers. Moreover, we conduct additional\ncomparisons of Synthesizers against Dynamic Convolutions, showing that simple\nRandom Synthesizer is not only $60\\%$ faster but also improves perplexity by a\nrelative $3.5\\%$. Finally, we show that simple factorized Synthesizers can\noutperform Linformers on encoding only tasks.",

In\nprevious studies, delayed feedback problem is handled either by waiting\npositive label for a long period of time, or by consuming the negative sample\non its arrival and then insert a positive duplicate when a conversion happens\nlater. Indeed, there is a trade-off between waiting for more accurate labels\nand utilizing fresh data, which is not considered in existing works. To strike\na balance in this trade-off, we propose Elapsed-Time Sampling Delayed Feedback\nModel (ES-DFM), which models the relationship between the observed conversion\ndistribution and the true conversion distribution. Then we optimize the\nexpectation of true conversion distribution via importance sampling under the\nelapsed-time sampling distribution. We further estimate the importance weight\nfor each instance, which is used as the weight of loss function in CVR\nprediction.

Automating this practice constitutes a\nnon-trivial problem, as the range of actions that a human expert may attempts\nagainst a system and the range of knowledge she relies on to take her decisions\nare hard to capture. In this paper, we focus our attention on simplified\npenetration testing problems expressed in the form of capture the flag hacking\nchallenges, and we analyze how model-free reinforcement learning algorithms may\nhelp to solve them. In modeling these capture the flag competitions as\nreinforcement learning problems we highlight that a specific challenge that\ncharacterize penetration testing is the problem of discovering the structure of\nthe problem at hand. We then show how this challenge may be eased by relying on\ndifferent forms of prior knowledge that may be provided to the agent.

          "description": "Despite the prevalence of hypergraphs in a variety of high-impact\napplications, there are relatively few works on hypergraph representation\nlearning, most of which primarily focus on hyperlink prediction, often\nrestricted to the transductive learning setting. Among others, a major hurdle\nfor effective hypergraph representation learning lies in the label scarcity of\nnodes and/or hyperedges. To address this issue, this paper presents an\nend-to-end, bi-level pre-training strategy with Graph Neural Networks for\nhypergraphs. The proposed framework named HyperGene bears three distinctive\nadvantages. First, it is capable of ingesting the labeling information when\navailable, but more importantly, it is mainly designed in the self-supervised\nfashion which significantly broadens its applicability. Second, at the heart of\nthe proposed HyperGene are two carefully designed pretexts, one on the node\nlevel and the other on the hyperedge level, which enable us to encode both the\nlocal and the global context in a mutually complementary way. Third, the\nproposed framework can work in both transductive and inductive settings. When\napplying the two proposed pretexts in tandem, it can accelerate the adaptation\nof the knowledge from the pre-trained model to downstream applications in the\ntransductive setting, thanks to the bi-level nature of the proposed method. The\nextensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) HyperGene achieves up to\n5.69% improvements in hyperedge classification, and (2) improves pre-training\nefficiency by up to 42.80% on average.",

They are able to\ndo this by outputting prediction sets, rather than simple point predictions.\nThe conformal predictor is valid in the sense that the accuracy of its\npredictions is guaranteed to meet the confidence level, only assuming\nexchangeability in the data. Since accuracy is guaranteed, the performance of a\nconformal predictor is measured through the efficiency of the prediction sets.\nTypically, a conformal predictor is built on an underlying machine learning\nalgorithm and hence its predictive power is inherited from this algorithm.\nHowever, since the underlying machine learning algorithm is not trained with\nthe objective of minimizing predictive efficiency it means that the resulting\nconformal predictor may be sub-optimal and not aligned sufficiently to this\nobjective. Hence, in this study we consider an approach to train the conformal\npredictor directly with maximum predictive efficiency as the optimization\nobjective, and we focus specifically on the inductive conformal predictor for\nclassification. To do this, the conformal predictor is approximated by a\ndifferentiable objective function and gradient descent used to optimize it. The\nresulting parameter estimates are then passed to a proper inductive conformal\npredictor to give valid prediction sets. We test the method on several real\nworld data sets and find that the method is promising and in most cases gives\nimproved predictive efficiency against a baseline conformal predictor.",

We prove that, initialized with a Gaussian that has\nsufficiently small variance, $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\lambda d\\epsilon^{-1})$\nsteps of the LMC algorithm are sufficient to reach $\\epsilon$-neighborhood of\nthe target in Chi-square divergence, where $\\lambda$ is the log-Sobolev\nconstant of $\\nu_*$. Our results do not require warm-start to deal with\nexponential dimension dependency in Chi-square divergence at initialization. In\nparticular, for strongly convex and first-order smooth potentials, we show that\nthe LMC algorithm achieves the rate estimate\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d\\epsilon^{-1})$ which improves the previously known\nrates in this metric, under the same assumptions. Translating to other metrics,\nour result also recovers the best-known rate estimates in KL divergence, total\nvariation and $2$-Wasserstein distance in the same setup. Finally, as we rely\non the log-Sobolev inequality, our framework covers a wide range of non-convex\npotentials that are first-order smooth and that exhibit strong convexity\noutside of a compact region.",

          "description": "Since the introduction of DQN, a vast majority of reinforcement learning\nresearch has focused on reinforcement learning with deep neural networks as\nfunction approximators. New methods are typically evaluated on a set of\nenvironments that have now become standard, such as Atari 2600 games. While\nthese benchmarks help standardize evaluation, their computational cost has the\nunfortunate side effect of widening the gap between those with ample access to\ncomputational resources, and those without. In this work we argue that, despite\nthe community's emphasis on large-scale environments, the traditional\nsmall-scale environments can still yield valuable scientific insights and can\nhelp reduce the barriers to entry for underprivileged communities.

          "description": "Node representation learning for directed graphs is critically important to\nfacilitate many graph mining tasks. To capture the directed edges between\nnodes, existing methods mostly learn two embedding vectors for each node,\nsource vector and target vector. However, these methods learn the source and\ntarget vectors separately. For the node with very low indegree or outdegree,\nthe corresponding target vector or source vector cannot be effectively learned.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Directed Graph embedding framework based on\nGenerative Adversarial Network, called DGGAN. The main idea is to use\nadversarial mechanisms to deploy a discriminator and two generators that\njointly learn each node's source and target vectors. For a given node, the two\ngenerators are trained to generate its fake target and source neighbor nodes\nfrom the same underlying distribution, and the discriminator aims to\ndistinguish whether a neighbor node is real or fake. The two generators are\nformulated into a unified framework and could mutually reinforce each other to\nlearn more robust source and target vectors. Extensive experiments show that\nDGGAN consistently and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods across multiple graph mining tasks on directed graphs.",

Lee et al. (2019) built on this result by establishing that the\noutput of a neural network trained using gradient descent can be approximated\nby a linear model for wide networks. In parallel, a recent line of studies\n(Schoenholz et al. 2017; Hayou et al. 2019) has suggested that a special\ninitialization, known as the Edge of Chaos, improves training. In this paper,\nwe bridge the gap between these two concepts by quantifying the impact of the\ninitialization and the activation function on the NTK when the network depth\nbecomes large. In particular, we show that the performance of wide deep neural\nnetworks cannot be explained by the NTK regime and we provide experiments\nillustrating our theoretical results.",

These rewards differ from the traditional\nsparse reward. First, a posture reward function is proposed to speed up the\nlearning process with a more reasonable trajectory by modeling the distance and\ndirection constraints, which can reduce the blindness of exploration. Second, a\nstride reward function is proposed to improve the stability of the learning\nprocess by modeling the distance and movement distance of joint constraints.\nFinally, in order to further improve learning efficiency, we are inspired by\nthe cognitive process of human behavior and propose a stage incentive\nmechanism, including a hard stage incentive reward function and a soft stage\nincentive reward function. Extensive experiments show that the soft stage\nincentive reward function is able to improve the convergence rate by up to\n46.9% with the state-of-the-art DRL methods.

Many works achieve\ndisentanglement upon information bottlenecks (IB). Despite their elegant\nmathematical foundations, the IB branch usually exhibits lower performance.

Different from most\nof the previous studies which used either one of CT or X-ray images, we\nemployed both data types with sufficient samples in implementation. On the\nother hand, due to the extreme sensitivity of this pervasive virus, model\nuncertainty should be considered, while most previous studies have overlooked\nit.

          "description": "Widespread adoption of high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel\ncells (HT-PEMFCs) and HT-PEM electrochemical hydrogen pumps (HT-PEM ECHPs)\nrequires models and computational tools that provide accurate scale-up and\noptimization. Knowledge-based modeling has limitations as it is time consuming\nand requires information about the system that is not always available (e.g.,\nmaterial properties and interfacial behavior between different materials).\nData-driven modeling on the other hand, is easier to implement, but often\nnecessitates large datasets that could be difficult to obtain. In this\ncontribution, knowledge-based modeling and data-driven modeling are uniquely\ncombined by implementing a Few-Shot Learning (FSL) approach. A knowledge-based\nmodel originally developed for a HT-PEMFC was used to generate simulated data\n(887,735 points) and used to pretrain a neural network source model.\nFurthermore, the source model developed for HT-PEMFCs was successfully applied\nto HT-PEM ECHPs - a different electrochemical system that utilizes similar\nmaterials to the fuel cell. Experimental datasets from both HT-PEMFCs and\nHT-PEM ECHPs with different materials and operating conditions (~50 points\neach) were used to train 8 target models via FSL. Models for the unseen data\nreached high accuracies in all cases (rRMSE between 1.04 and 3.73% for HT-PEMCs\nand between 6.38 and 8.46% for HT-PEM ECHPs).",

          "description": "Searching for objects in indoor organized environments such as homes or\noffices is part of our everyday activities. When looking for a target object,\nwe jointly reason about the rooms and containers the object is likely to be in;\nthe same type of container will have a different probability of having the\ntarget depending on the room it is in. We also combine geometric and semantic\ninformation to infer what container is best to search, or what other objects\nare best to move, if the target object is hidden from view. We propose to use a\n3D scene graph representation to capture the hierarchical, semantic, and\ngeometric aspects of this problem. To exploit this representation in a search\nprocess, we introduce Hierarchical Mechanical Search (HMS), a method that\nguides an agent's actions towards finding a target object specified with a\nnatural language description. HMS is based on a novel neural network\narchitecture that uses neural message passing of vectors with visual,\ngeometric, and linguistic information to allow HMS to reason across layers of\nthe graph while combining semantic and geometric cues. HMS is evaluated on a\nnovel dataset of 500 3D scene graphs with dense placements of semantically\nrelated objects in storage locations, and is shown to be significantly better\nthan several baselines at finding objects and close to the oracle policy in\nterms of the median number of actions required.

In spite of their importance,\nbeekeeping is exclusively dependent on human labor and experience-derived\nheuristics, while requiring frequent human checkups to ensure the colony is\nhealthy, which can disrupt the colony. Increasingly, pollinator populations are\ndeclining due to threats from climate change, pests, environmental toxicity,\nmaking their management even more critical than ever before in order to ensure\nsustained global food security.

The model is trained jointly on audio reconstruction\nand prediction losses based on human inspections, in order to model both\nlow-level audio features and circadian temporal dynamics. We show that this\nmodel performs well despite limited labels, and can learn an audio embedding\nthat is useful for characterizing different sound profiles of beehives.

          "description": "Modeling the burning processes of biomass such as wood, grass, and crops is\ncrucial for the modeling and prediction of wildland and urban fire behavior.\nDespite its importance, the burning of solid fuels remains poorly understood,\nwhich can be partly attributed to the unknown chemical kinetics of most solid\nfuels. Most available kinetic models were built upon expert knowledge, which\nrequires chemical insights and years of experience. This work presents a\nframework for autonomously discovering biomass pyrolysis kinetic models from\nthermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) experimental data using the recently developed\nchemical reaction neural networks (CRNN). The approach incorporated the CRNN\nmodel into the framework of neural ordinary differential equations to predict\nthe residual mass in TGA data. In addition to the flexibility of\nneural-network-based models, the learned CRNN model is fully interpretable, by\nincorporating the fundamental physics laws, such as the law of mass action and\nArrhenius law, into the neural network structure. The learned CRNN model can\nthen be translated into the classical forms of biomass chemical kinetic models,\nwhich facilitates the extraction of chemical insights and the integration of\nthe kinetic model into large-scale fire simulations. We demonstrated the\neffectiveness of the framework in predicting the pyrolysis and oxidation of\ncellulose. This successful demonstration opens the possibility of rapid and\nautonomous chemical kinetic modeling of solid fuels, such as wildfire fuels and\nindustrial polymers.",

          "description": "Representation learning on heterogeneous graphs aims to obtain meaningful\nnode representations to facilitate various downstream tasks, such as node\nclassification and link prediction. Existing heterogeneous graph learning\nmethods are primarily developed by following the propagation mechanism of node\nrepresentations. There are few efforts on studying the role of relations for\nimproving the learning of more fine-grained node representations. Indeed, it is\nimportant to collaboratively learn the semantic representations of relations\nand discern node representations with respect to different relation types. To\nthis end, in this paper, we propose a novel Relation-aware Heterogeneous Graph\nNeural Network, namely R-HGNN, to learn node representations on heterogeneous\ngraphs at a fine-grained level by considering relation-aware characteristics.\nSpecifically, a dedicated graph convolution component is first designed to\nlearn unique node representations from each relation-specific graph separately.\nThen, a cross-relation message passing module is developed to improve the\ninteractions of node representations across different relations. Also, the\nrelation representations are learned in a layer-wise manner to capture relation\nsemantics, which are used to guide the node representation learning process.\nMoreover, a semantic fusing module is presented to aggregate relation-aware\nnode representations into a compact representation with the learned relation\nrepresentations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a variety of\ngraph learning tasks, and experimental results demonstrate that our approach\nconsistently outperforms existing methods among all the tasks.",

Machine learning techniques, and deep neural networks in particular,\nare the state-of-the-art for most medical image segmentation tasks. Issues with\nclass imbalance pose a significant challenge in medical datasets, with lesions\noften occupying a considerably smaller volume relative to the background. Loss\nfunctions used in the training of deep learning algorithms differ in their\nrobustness to class imbalance, with direct consequences for model convergence.\nThe most commonly used loss functions for segmentation are based on either the\ncross entropy loss, Dice loss or a combination of the two. We propose a Unified\nFocal loss, a new framework that generalises Dice and cross entropy-based\nlosses for handling class imbalance. We evaluate our proposed loss function on\nthree highly class imbalanced, publicly available medical imaging datasets:\nBreast Ultrasound 2017 (BUS2017), Brain Tumour Segmentation 2020 (BraTS20) and\nKidney Tumour Segmentation 2019 (KiTS19). We compare our loss function\nperformance against six Dice or cross entropy-based loss functions, and\ndemonstrate that our proposed loss function is robust to class imbalance,\noutperforming the other loss functions across datasets. Finally, we use the\nUnified Focal loss together with deep supervision to achieve state-of-the-art\nresults without modification of the original U-Net architecture, with a mean\nDice similarity coefficient (DSC)=0.948 on BUS2017, enhancing tumour region\nDSC=0.800 on BraTS20 and kidney tumour DSC=0.758 on KiTS19.

We\ninvestigate what expectations people have about a learner when they teach them\nin an online manner using rewards and punishment. We focus on a common\nreinforcement learning method, Q-learning, and examine what assumptions people\nhave using a behavioral experiment. To do so, we first establish a normative\nstandard, by formulating the problem as a machine teaching optimization\nproblem. To solve the machine teaching optimization problem, we use a deep\nlearning approximation method which simulates learners in the environment and\nlearns to predict how feedback affects the learner's internal states. What do\npeople assume about a learner's learning and discount rates when they teach\nthem an idealized exploration-exploitation task? In a behavioral experiment, we\nfind that people can teach the task to Q-learners in a relatively efficient and\neffective manner when the learner uses a small value for its discounting rate\nand a large value for its learning rate. However, they still are suboptimal. We\nalso find that providing people with real-time updates of how possible feedback\nwould affect the Q-learner's internal states weakly helps them teach.

          "description": "The Information bottleneck (IB) method enables optimizing over the trade-off\nbetween compression of data and prediction accuracy of learned representations,\nand has successfully and robustly been applied to both supervised and\nunsupervised representation learning problems. However, IB has several\nlimitations. First, the IB problem is hard to optimize. The IB Lagrangian\n$\\mathcal{L}_{IB}:=I(X;Z)-\\beta I(Y;Z)$ is non-convex and existing solutions\nguarantee only local convergence. As a result, the obtained solutions depend on\ninitialization. Second, the evaluation of a solution is also a challenging\ntask. Conventionally, it resorts to characterizing the information plane, that\nis, plotting $I(Y;Z)$ versus $I(X;Z)$ for all solutions obtained from different\ninitial points. Furthermore, the IB Lagrangian has phase transitions while\nvarying the multiplier $\\beta$. At phase transitions, both $I(X;Z)$ and\n$I(Y;Z)$ increase abruptly and the rate of convergence becomes significantly\nslow for existing solutions. Recent works with IB adopt variational surrogate\nbounds to the IB Lagrangian. Although allowing efficient optimization, how\nclose are these surrogates to the IB Lagrangian is not clear. In this work, we\nsolve the IB Lagrangian using augmented Lagrangian methods. With augmented\nvariables, we show that the IB objective can be solved with the alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM). Different from prior works, we prove\nthat the proposed algorithm is consistently convergent, regardless of the value\nof $\\beta$. Empirically, our gradient-descent-based method results in\ninformation plane points that are comparable to those obtained through the\nconventional Blahut-Arimoto-based solvers and is convergent for a wider range\nof the penalty coefficient than previous ADMM solvers.",

          "description": "Weakly-supervised anomaly detection aims at learning an anomaly detector from\na limited amount of labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. Recent works\nbuild deep neural networks for anomaly detection by discriminatively mapping\nthe normal samples and abnormal samples to different regions in the feature\nspace or fitting different distributions. However, due to the limited number of\nannotated anomaly samples, directly training networks with the discriminative\nloss may not be sufficient. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novel\nstrategy to transform the input data into a more meaningful representation that\ncould be used for anomaly detection. Specifically, we leverage an autoencoder\nto encode the input data and utilize three factors, hidden representation,\nreconstruction residual vector, and reconstruction error, as the new\nrepresentation for the input data. This representation amounts to encode a test\nsample with its projection on the training data manifold, its direction to its\nprojection and its distance to its projection. In addition to this encoding, we\nalso propose a novel network architecture to seamlessly incorporate those three\nfactors. From our extensive experiments, the benefits of the proposed strategy\nare clearly demonstrated by its superior performance over the competitive\nmethods.",

          "description": "Despite its success in a wide range of applications, characterizing the\ngeneralization properties of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in non-convex\ndeep learning problems is still an important challenge. While modeling the\ntrajectories of SGD via stochastic differential equations (SDE) under\nheavy-tailed gradient noise has recently shed light over several peculiar\ncharacteristics of SGD, a rigorous treatment of the generalization properties\nof such SDEs in a learning theoretical framework is still missing. Aiming to\nbridge this gap, in this paper, we prove generalization bounds for SGD under\nthe assumption that its trajectories can be well-approximated by a \\emph{Feller\nprocess}, which defines a rich class of Markov processes that include several\nrecent SDE representations (both Brownian or heavy-tailed) as its special case.\nWe show that the generalization error can be controlled by the \\emph{Hausdorff\ndimension} of the trajectories, which is intimately linked to the tail behavior\nof the driving process. Our results imply that heavier-tailed processes should\nachieve better generalization; hence, the tail-index of the process can be used\nas a notion of \"capacity metric\". We support our theory with experiments on\ndeep neural networks illustrating that the proposed capacity metric accurately\nestimates the generalization error, and it does not necessarily grow with the\nnumber of parameters unlike the existing capacity metrics in the literature.",

As pointed out by recent studies, most GNNs assume local\nhomophily, i.e., strong similarities in local neighborhoods. This assumption\nhowever limits the generalizability power of GNNs. To address this limitation,\nwe propose a flexible GNN model, which is capable of handling any graphs\nwithout being restricted by their underlying homophily. At its core, this model\nadopts a node attention mechanism based on multiple learnable spectral filters;\ntherefore, the aggregation scheme is learned adaptively for each graph in the\nspectral domain. We evaluated the proposed model on node classification tasks\nover eight benchmark datasets. The proposed model is shown to generalize well\nto both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Further, it outperforms all\nstate-of-the-art baselines on heterophilic graphs and performs comparably with\nthem on homophilic graphs.",

          "description": "The creation of altered and manipulated faces has become more common due to\nthe improvement of DeepFake generation methods. Simultaneously, we have seen\ndetection models' development for differentiating between a manipulated and\noriginal face from image or video content. We have observed that most publicly\navailable DeepFake detection datasets have limited variations, where a single\nface is used in many videos, resulting in an oversampled training dataset. Due\nto this, deep neural networks tend to overfit to the facial features instead of\nlearning to detect manipulation features of DeepFake content. As a result, most\ndetection architectures perform poorly when tested on unseen data. In this\npaper, we provide a quantitative analysis to investigate this problem and\npresent a solution to prevent model overfitting due to the high volume of\nsamples generated from a small number of actors. We introduce Face-Cutout, a\ndata augmentation method for training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to\nimprove DeepFake detection. In this method, training images with various\nocclusions are dynamically generated using face landmark information\nirrespective of orientation. Unlike other general-purpose augmentation methods,\nit focuses on the facial information that is crucial for DeepFake detection.\nOur method achieves a reduction in LogLoss of 15.2% to 35.3% on different\ndatasets, compared to other occlusion-based augmentation techniques. We show\nthat Face-Cutout can be easily integrated with any CNN-based recognition model\nand improve detection performance.",

          "description": "In this paper, we propose a deep invertible hybrid model which integrates\ndiscriminative and generative learning at a latent space level for\nsemi-supervised few-shot classification. Various tasks for classifying new\nspecies from image data can be modeled as a semi-supervised few-shot\nclassification, which assumes a labeled and unlabeled training examples and a\nsmall support set of the target classes. Predicting target classes with a few\nsupport examples per class makes the learning task difficult for existing\nsemi-supervised classification methods, including selftraining, which\niteratively estimates class labels of unlabeled training examples to learn a\nclassifier for the training classes. To exploit unlabeled training examples\neffectively, we adopt as the objective function the composite likelihood, which\nintegrates discriminative and generative learning and suits better with deep\nneural networks than the parameter coupling prior, the other popular integrated\nlearning approach. In our proposed model, the discriminative and generative\nmodels are respectively Prototypical Networks, which have shown excellent\nperformance in various kinds of few-shot learning, and Normalizing Flow a deep\ninvertible model which returns the exact marginal likelihood unlike the other\nthree major methods, i.e., VAE, GAN, and autoregressive model.

In\nsharp contrast to the conventional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms,\nBD-IRL can overcome the dilemma incurred in the reward function design and\nimprove the exploration mechanism of RL, which opens new avenues to building\nsuperior expert systems. Most existing BD-IRL algorithms are performed in two\nstages by first inferring a reward function before learning a policy via RL.\nHowever, such two-stage BD-IRL algorithms suffer from high computational\ncomplexity, weak robustness, and large performance variations. In particular, a\npoor reward function derived in the first stage will inevitably incur severe\nperformance loss in the second stage. In this work, we propose a hybrid\nadversarial inverse reinforcement learning (HAIRL) algorithm that is one-stage,\nmodel-free, generative-adversarial (GA) fashion and curiosity-driven. Thanks to\nthe one-stage design, the HAIRL can integrate both the reward function learning\nand the policy optimization into one procedure, which leads to many advantages\nsuch as low computational complexity, high robustness, and strong adaptability.\nMore specifically, HAIRL simultaneously imitates the demonstrator and explores\nBD performance by utilizing hybrid rewards. In particular, the Wasserstein-1\ndistance (WD) is introduced into HAIRL to stabilize the imitation procedure\nwhile a novel end-to-end curiosity module (ECM) is developed to improve the\nexploration.

          "description": "A major factor in the success of deep neural networks is the use of\nsophisticated architectures rather than the classical multilayer perceptron\n(MLP). Residual networks (ResNets) stand out among these powerful modern\narchitectures. Previous works focused on the optimization advantages of deep\nResNets over deep MLPs. In this paper, we show another distinction between the\ntwo models, namely, a tendency of ResNets to promote smoother interpolations\nthan MLPs. We analyze this phenomenon via the neural tangent kernel (NTK)\napproach. First, we compute the NTK for a considered ResNet model and prove its\nstability during gradient descent training. Then, we show by various evaluation\nmethodologies that for ReLU activations the NTK of ResNet, and its kernel\nregression results, are smoother than the ones of MLP. The better smoothness\nobserved in our analysis may explain the better generalization ability of\nResNets and the practice of moderately attenuating the residual blocks.",

          "description": "Numerical integration is a foundational technique in scientific computing and\nis at the core of many computer vision applications. Among these applications,\nneural volume rendering has recently been proposed as a new paradigm for view\nsynthesis, achieving photorealistic image quality. However, a fundamental\nobstacle to making these methods practical is the extreme computational and\nmemory requirements caused by the required volume integrations along the\nrendered rays during training and inference. Millions of rays, each requiring\nhundreds of forward passes through a neural network are needed to approximate\nthose integrations with Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we propose automatic\nintegration, a new framework for learning efficient, closed-form solutions to\nintegrals using coordinate-based neural networks. For training, we instantiate\nthe computational graph corresponding to the derivative of the network. The\ngraph is fitted to the signal to integrate. After optimization, we reassemble\nthe graph to obtain a network that represents the antiderivative. By the\nfundamental theorem of calculus, this enables the calculation of any definite\nintegral in two evaluations of the network. Applying this approach to neural\nrendering, we improve a tradeoff between rendering speed and image quality:\nimproving render times by greater than 10 times with a tradeoff of slightly\nreduced image quality.",

          "description": "Support vector machines (SVMs) are powerful supervised learning tools\ndeveloped to solve classification problems. However, SVMs are likely to perform\npoorly in the classification of imbalanced data. The rough set theory presents\na mathematical tool for inference in nondeterministic cases that provides\nmethods for removing irrelevant information from data. In this work, we propose\nan approach that efficiently used fuzzy rough set theory in weighted least\nsquares twin support vector machine called FRLSTSVM for classification of\nimbalanced data. The first innovation is introducing a new fuzzy rough\nset-based under-sampling strategy to make the classifier robust in terms of the\nimbalanced data. For constructing the two proximal hyperplanes in FRLSTSVM,\ndata points from the minority class remain unchanged while a subset of data\npoints in the majority class are selected using a new method. In this model, we\nembed the weight biases in the LSTSVM formulations to overcome the bias\nphenomenon in the original twin SVM for the classification of imbalanced data.\nIn order to determine these weights in this formulation, we introduce a new\nstrategy that uses fuzzy rough set theory as the second innovation.\nExperimental results on the famous imbalanced datasets, compared to the related\ntraditional SVM-based methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\nFRLSTSVM model in the imbalanced data classification.",

          "description": "The bus system is a critical component of sustainable urban transportation.\nHowever, due to the significant uncertainties in passenger demand and traffic\nconditions, bus operation is unstable in nature and bus bunching has become a\ncommon phenomenon that undermines the reliability and efficiency of bus\nservices. Despite recent advances in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)\non traffic control, little research has focused on bus fleet control due to the\ntricky asynchronous characteristic -- control actions only happen when a bus\narrives at a bus stop and thus agents do not act simultaneously. In this study,\nwe formulate route-level bus fleet control as an asynchronous multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (ASMR) problem and extend the classical actor-critic\narchitecture to handle the asynchronous issue. Specifically, we design a novel\ncritic network to effectively approximate the marginal contribution for other\nagents, in which graph attention neural network is used to conduct inductive\nlearning for policy evaluation. The critic structure also helps the ego agent\noptimize its policy more efficiently. We evaluate the proposed framework on\nreal-world bus services and actual passenger demand derived from smart card\ndata. Our results show that the proposed model outperforms both traditional\nheadway-based control methods and existing MARL methods.",

          "description": "This paper considers joint learning of multiple sparse Granger graphical\nmodels to discover underlying common and differential Granger causality (GC)\nstructures across multiple time series. This can be applied to drawing\ngroup-level brain connectivity inferences from a homogeneous group of subjects\nor discovering network differences among groups of signals collected under\nheterogeneous conditions. By recognizing that the GC of a single multivariate\ntime series can be characterized by common zeros of vector autoregressive (VAR)\nlag coefficients, a group sparse prior is included in joint regularized\nleast-squares estimations of multiple VAR models. Group-norm regularizations\nbased on group- and fused-lasso penalties encourage a decomposition of multiple\nnetworks into a common GC structure, with other remaining parts defined in\nindividual-specific networks. Prior information about sparseness and sparsity\npatterns of desired GC networks are incorporated as relative weights, while a\nnon-convex group norm in the penalty is proposed to enhance the accuracy of\nnetwork estimation in low-sample settings. Extensive numerical results on\nsimulations illustrated our method's improvements over existing sparse\nestimation approaches on GC network sparsity recovery. Our methods were also\napplied to available resting-state fMRI time series from the ADHD-200 data sets\nto learn the differences of causality mechanisms, called effective brain\nconnectivity, between adolescents with ADHD and typically developing children.\nOur analysis revealed that parts of the causality differences between the two\ngroups often resided in the orbitofrontal region and areas associated with the\nlimbic system, which agreed with clinical findings and data-driven results in\nprevious studies.",

In a robust setting in which every sampled point may be perturbed\nby a suitably-constrained adversary, we provide a novel lower bound for\ndeterministic strategies, demonstrating an inevitable joint dependence of the\ncumulative regret on the corruption level and the time horizon, in contrast\nwith existing lower bounds that only characterize the individual dependencies.\nFurthermore, in a distinct robust setting in which the final point is perturbed\nby an adversary, we strengthen an existing lower bound that only holds for\ntarget success probabilities very close to one, by allowing for arbitrary\nsuccess probabilities above $\\frac{2}{3}$.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are quantized for efficient inference on\nresource-constrained platforms. However, training deep learning models with\nlow-precision weights and activations involves a demanding optimization task,\nwhich calls for minimizing a stage-wise loss function subject to a discrete\nset-constraint. While numerous training methods have been proposed, existing\nstudies for full quantization of DNNs are mostly empirical. From a theoretical\npoint of view, we study practical techniques for overcoming the combinatorial\nnature of network quantization. Specifically, we investigate a simple yet\npowerful projected gradient-like algorithm for quantizing two-linear-layer\nnetworks, which proceeds by repeatedly moving one step at float weights in the\nnegation of a heuristic \\emph{fake} gradient of the loss function (so-called\ncoarse gradient) evaluated at quantized weights. For the first time, we prove\nthat under mild conditions, the sequence of quantized weights recurrently\nvisits the global optimum of the discrete minimization problem for training\nfully quantized network. We also show numerical evidence of the recurrence\nphenomenon of weight evolution in training quantized deep networks.",

          "description": "It is well-known that standard neural networks, even with a high\nclassification accuracy, are vulnerable to small $\\ell_\\infty$-norm bounded\nadversarial perturbations. Although many attempts have been made, most previous\nworks either can only provide empirical verification of the defense to a\nparticular attack method, or can only develop a certified guarantee of the\nmodel robustness in limited scenarios. In this paper, we seek for a new\napproach to develop a theoretically principled neural network that inherently\nresists $\\ell_\\infty$ perturbations. In particular, we design a novel neuron\nthat uses $\\ell_\\infty$-distance as its basic operation (which we call\n$\\ell_\\infty$-dist neuron), and show that any neural network constructed with\n$\\ell_\\infty$-dist neurons (called $\\ell_{\\infty}$-dist net) is naturally a\n1-Lipschitz function with respect to $\\ell_\\infty$-norm. This directly provides\na rigorous guarantee of the certified robustness based on the margin of\nprediction outputs. We also prove that such networks have enough expressive\npower to approximate any 1-Lipschitz function with robust generalization\nguarantee. Our experimental results show that the proposed network is\npromising. Using $\\ell_{\\infty}$-dist nets as the basic building blocks, we\nconsistently achieve state-of-the-art performance on commonly used datasets:\n93.09% certified accuracy on MNIST ($\\epsilon=0.3$), 79.23% on Fashion MNIST\n($\\epsilon=0.1$) and 35.10% on CIFAR-10 ($\\epsilon=8/255$).",

This, in turn,\nmay lead to hard-to-merge changes or even merge conflicts, logical bugs that\nare difficult to detect, duplication of work, and wasted developer\nproductivity.

Motivated by these\nfindings, we design, implement, and deploy a service named ConE (Concurrent\nEdit Detector) that proactively detects pull requests containing concurrent\nedits, to help mitigate the problems caused by them. ConE has been designed to\nscale, and to minimize false alarms while still flagging relevant concurrently\nedited files. Key concepts of ConE include the detection of the Extent of\nOverlap between pull requests, and the identification of Rarely Concurrently\nEdited Files. To evaluate ConE, we report on its operational deployment on 234\nrepositories inside Microsoft. ConE assessed 26,000 pull requests and made 775\nrecommendations about conflicting changes, which were rated as useful in over\n70% (554) of the cases.

Existing deep\nlearning based LLP methods utilize end-to-end pipelines to obtain the\nproportional loss with Kullback-Leibler divergence between the bag-level prior\nand posterior class distributions. However, the unconstrained optimization on\nthis objective can hardly reach a solution in accordance with the given\nproportions. Besides, concerning the probabilistic classifier, this strategy\nunavoidably results in high-entropy conditional class distributions at the\ninstance level.

          "description": "Most existing graph neural networks (GNNs) learn node embeddings using the\nframework of message passing and aggregation. Such GNNs are incapable of\nlearning relative positions between graph nodes within a graph. To empower GNNs\nwith the awareness of node positions, some nodes are set as anchors. Then,\nusing the distances from a node to the anchors, GNNs can infer relative\npositions between nodes. However, P-GNNs arbitrarily select anchors, leading to\ncompromising position-awareness and feature extraction. To eliminate this\ncompromise, we demonstrate that selecting evenly distributed and asymmetric\nanchors is essential. On the other hand, we show that choosing anchors that can\naggregate embeddings of all the nodes within a graph is NP-hard. Therefore,\ndevising efficient optimal algorithms in a deterministic approach is\npractically not feasible. To ensure position-awareness and bypass\nNP-completeness, we propose Position-Sensing Graph Neural Networks (PSGNNs),\nlearning how to choose anchors in a back-propagatable fashion. Experiments\nverify the effectiveness of PSGNNs against state-of-the-art GNNs, substantially\nimproving performance on various synthetic and real-world graph datasets while\nenjoying stable scalability. Specifically, PSGNNs on average boost AUC more\nthan 14% for pairwise node classification and 18% for link prediction over the\nexisting state-of-the-art position-aware methods.

          "description": "Digital contents have grown dramatically in recent years, leading to\nincreased attention to copyright. Image watermarking has been considered one of\nthe most popular methods for copyright protection. With the recent advancements\nin applying deep neural networks in image processing, these networks have also\nbeen used in image watermarking. Robustness and imperceptibility are two\nchallenging features of watermarking methods that the trade-off between them\nshould be satisfied. In this paper, we propose to use an end-to-end network for\nwatermarking. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to control the\nembedding strength based on the image content. Dynamic embedding helps the\nnetwork to have the lowest effect on the visual quality of the watermarked\nimage. Different image processing attacks are simulated as a network layer to\nimprove the robustness of the model. Our method is a blind watermarking\napproach that replicates the watermark string to create a matrix of the same\nsize as the input image. Instead of diffusing the watermark data into the input\nimage, we inject the data into the feature space and force the network to do\nthis in regions that increase the robustness against various attacks.\nExperimental results show the superiority of the proposed method in terms of\nimperceptibility and robustness compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

However, the implementation of deep learning in\ndigital computers is intrinsically wasteful, with energy consumption becoming\nprohibitively high for many applications. This has stimulated the development\nof specialized hardware, ranging from neuromorphic CMOS integrated circuits and\nintegrated photonic tensor cores to unconventional, material-based computing\nsystems. The learning process in these material systems, taking place, e.g., by\nartificial evolution or surrogate neural network modelling, is still a\ncomplicated and time-consuming process.

We demonstrate the method in\nour recently developed dopant network processing units, where we readily\nrealize all Boolean gates.

          "description": "We consider a system of several collocated nodes sharing a time slotted\nwireless channel, and seek a MAC that (i) provides low mean delay, (ii) has\ndistributed control (i.e., there is no central scheduler), and (iii) does not\nrequire explicit exchange of state information or control signals. The design\nof such MAC protocols must keep in mind the need for contention access at light\ntraffic, and scheduled access in heavy traffic, leading to the long-standing\ninterest in hybrid, adaptive MACs.\n\nWe first propose EZMAC, a simple extension of an existing decentralized,\nhybrid MAC called ZMAC. Next, motivated by our results on delay and throughput\noptimality in partially observed, constrained queuing networks, we develop\nanother decentralized MAC protocol that we term QZMAC. A method to improve the\nshort-term fairness of QZMAC is proposed and analysed, and the resulting\nmodified algorithm is shown to possess better fairness properties than QZMAC.\nThe theory developed to reduce delay is also shown to work %with different\ntraffic types (batch arrivals, for example) and even in the presence of\ntransmission errors and fast fading.\n\nExtensions to handle time critical traffic (alarms, for example) and hidden\nnodes are also discussed. Practical implementation issues, such as handling\nClear Channel Assessment (CCA) errors, are outlined. We implement and\ndemonstrate the performance of QZMAC on a test bed consisting of CC2420 based\nCrossbow telosB motes, running the 6TiSCH communication stack on the Contiki\noperating system over the 2.4GHz ISM band.\n\nFinally, using simulations, we show that both protocols achieve mean delays\nmuch lower than those achieved by ZMAC, and QZMAC provides mean delays very\nclose to the minimum achievable in this setting, i.e., that of the centralized\ncomplete knowledge scheduler.",

          "description": "Federated Learning (FL) has recently received a lot of attention for\nlarge-scale privacy-preserving machine learning. However, high communication\noverheads due to frequent gradient transmissions decelerate FL. To mitigate the\ncommunication overheads, two main techniques have been studied: (i) local\nupdate of weights characterizing the trade-off between communication and\ncomputation and (ii) gradient compression characterizing the trade-off between\ncommunication and precision. To the best of our knowledge, studying and\nbalancing those two trade-offs jointly and dynamically while considering their\nimpacts on convergence has remained unresolved even though it promises\nsignificantly faster FL. In this paper, we first formulate our problem to\nminimize learning error with respect to two variables: local update\ncoefficients and sparsity budgets of gradient compression who characterize\ntrade-offs between communication and computation/precision, respectively. We\nthen derive an upper bound of the learning error in a given wall-clock time\nconsidering the interdependency between the two variables. Based on this\ntheoretical analysis, we propose an enhanced FL scheme, namely Fast FL (FFL),\nthat jointly and dynamically adjusts the two variables to minimize the learning\nerror. We demonstrate that FFL consistently achieves higher accuracies faster\nthan similar schemes existing in the literature.",

As such, methods that can ensure a fair learning outcome with\nrespect to all sensitive attributes of concern simultaneously need to be\ndeveloped.

We formulate it as a mutual information minimization problem and\npropose a generic end-to-end algorithmic framework to solve it.

Our proposed framework is generalizable to many\ndifferent settings, including other statistical notions of fairness, and could\nhandle any type of learning task equipped with a gradient-based optimizer.\nEmpirical evaluations in the fair classification task on three real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that our proposed framework can effectively debias the\nclassification results with minimal impact to the classification accuracy.",

          "description": "Sequences of events including infectious disease outbreaks, social network\nactivities, and crimes are ubiquitous and the data on such events carry\nessential information about the underlying diffusion processes between\ncommunities (e.g., regions, online user groups). Modeling diffusion processes\nand predicting future events are crucial in many applications including\nepidemic control, viral marketing, and predictive policing. Hawkes processes\noffer a central tool for modeling the diffusion processes, in which the\ninfluence from the past events is described by the triggering kernel. However,\nthe triggering kernel parameters, which govern how each community is influenced\nby the past events, are assumed to be static over time. In the real world, the\ndiffusion processes depend not only on the influences from the past, but also\nthe current (time-evolving) states of the communities, e.g., people's awareness\nof the disease and people's current interests. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Hawkes process model that is able to capture the underlying dynamics of\ncommunity states behind the diffusion processes and predict the occurrences of\nevents based on the dynamics. Specifically, we model the latent dynamic\nfunction that encodes these hidden dynamics by a mixture of neural networks.\nThen we design the triggering kernel using the latent dynamic function and its\nintegral. The proposed method, termed DHP (Dynamic Hawkes Processes), offers a\nflexible way to learn complex representations of the time-evolving communities'\nstates, while at the same time it allows to computing the exact likelihood,\nwhich makes parameter learning tractable.

          "description": "With the continuous development of the petroleum industry, long-distance\ntransportation of oil and gas has been the norm. Due to gravity differentiation\nin horizontal wells and highly deviated wells (non-vertical wells), the water\nphase at the bottom of the pipeline will cause scaling and corrosion in the\npipeline. Scaling and corrosion will make the transportation process difficult,\nand transportation costs will be considerably increased. Therefore, the study\nof the oil-water two-phase flow pattern is of great importance to oil\nproduction. In this paper, a fuzzy inference system is used to predict the flow\npattern of the fluid, get the prediction result, and compares it with the\nprediction result of the BP neural network. From the comparison of the results,\nwe found that the prediction results of the fuzzy inference system are more\naccurate and reliable than the prediction results of the BP neural network. At\nthe same time, it can realize real-time monitoring and has less error control.\nExperimental results demonstrate that in the entire production logging process\nof non-vertical wells, the use of a fuzzy inference system to predict fluid\nflow patterns can greatly save production costs while ensuring the safe\noperation of production equipment.",

While building such agents, one\nneeds to balance opposing desiderata, such as constraints on capacity and\ncompute, the ability to not catastrophically forget, and to exhibit positive\ntransfer on new tasks. Understanding the right trade-off is conceptually and\ncomputationally challenging, which we argue has led the community to overly\nfocus on catastrophic forgetting. In response to these issues, we advocate for\nthe need to prioritize forward transfer and propose Continual World, a\nbenchmark consisting of realistic and meaningfully diverse robotic tasks built\non top of Meta-World as a testbed. Following an in-depth empirical evaluation\nof existing CL methods, we pinpoint their limitations and highlight unique\nalgorithmic challenges in the RL setting.

Furthermore,\nthanks to the advancements in computer vision and machine learning, UAVs are\nbeing adopted for a broad range of solutions and applications. However, Deep\nNeural Networks (DNNs) are progressing toward deeper and complex models that\nprevent them from being executed on-board. In this paper, we propose a DNN\ndistribution methodology within UAVs to enable data classification in\nresource-constrained devices and avoid extra delays introduced by the\nserver-based solutions due to data communication over air-to-ground links. The\nproposed method is formulated as an optimization problem that aims to minimize\nthe latency between data collection and decision-making while considering the\nmobility model and the resource constraints of the UAVs as part of the\nair-to-air communication. We also introduce the mobility prediction to adapt\nour system to the dynamics of UAVs and the network variation. The simulation\nconducted to evaluate the performance and benchmark the proposed methods,\nnamely Optimal UAV-based Layer Distribution (OULD) and OULD with Mobility\nPrediction (OULD-MP), were run in an HPC cluster.

The EXoN provides two useful tools for implementing VAE. First, we can\nfreely assign a conceptual center of latent distribution for a specific label.\nWe separate the latent space of VAE with multi-modal property of the Gaussian\nmixture distribution according to labels of observations. Next, we can easily\ninvestigate the latent subspace by a simple statistics, known as\n$F$-statistics, obtained from the EXoN. We found that both negative\ncross-entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence play a crucial role in\nconstructing explainable latent space and the variability of the generated\nsamples from our proposed model depends on a specific subspace, called\n`activated latent subspace'.

          "description": "As global trends are shifting towards data-driven industries, the demand for\nautomated algorithms that can convert digital images of scanned documents into\nmachine readable information is rapidly growing. Besides the opportunity of\ndata digitization for the application of data analytic tools, there is also a\nmassive improvement towards automation of processes, which previously would\nrequire manual inspection of the documents. Although the introduction of\noptical character recognition technologies mostly solved the task of converting\nhuman-readable characters from images into machine-readable characters, the\ntask of extracting table semantics has been less focused on over the years. The\nrecognition of tables consists of two main tasks, namely table detection and\ntable structure recognition. Most prior work on this problem focuses on either\ntask without offering an end-to-end solution or paying attention to real\napplication conditions like rotated images or noise artefacts inside the\ndocument image. Recent work shows a clear trend towards deep learning\napproaches coupled with the use of transfer learning for the task of table\nstructure recognition due to the lack of sufficiently large datasets. In this\npaper we present a multistage pipeline named Multi-Type-TD-TSR, which offers an\nend-to-end solution for the problem of table recognition. It utilizes\nstate-of-the-art deep learning models for table detection and differentiates\nbetween 3 different types of tables based on the tables' borders. For the table\nstructure recognition we use a deterministic non-data driven algorithm, which\nworks on all table types. We additionally present two algorithms. One for\nunbordered tables and one for bordered tables, which are the base of the used\ntable structure recognition algorithm. We evaluate Multi-Type-TD-TSR on the\nICDAR 2019 table structure recognition dataset and achieve a new\nstate-of-the-art.",

Our framework uses a\nMachine Learning (ML) pipeline on a combination of monocular camera and LiDAR\ndata to detect vehicles in the surrounding 3D space of a moving platform. It\nuses frustum region proposals generated by State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) 2D object\ndetectors to segment LiDAR point clouds into point clusters which represent\npotentially individual objects. We evaluate the performance of classical ML\nalgorithms as part of an holistic pipeline for estimating the parameters of 3D\nbounding boxes which surround the vehicles around the moving platform.

We show that current approaches, which typically assume that\nregularization hyperparameters remain constant, lead to an overly pessimistic\nview of the algorithms' robustness and of the impact of regularization. We\npropose a novel optimal attack formulation that considers the effect of the\nattack on the hyperparameters, modelling the attack as a \\emph{minimax bilevel\noptimization problem}.

          "description": "The learning rate (LR) schedule is one of the most important hyper-parameters\nneeding careful tuning in training DNNs. However, it is also one of the least\nautomated parts of machine learning systems and usually costs significant\nmanual effort and computing. Though there are pre-defined LR schedules and\noptimizers with adaptive LR, they introduce new hyperparameters that need to be\ntuned separately for different tasks/datasets. In this paper, we consider the\nquestion: Can we automatically tune the LR over the course of training without\nhuman involvement? We propose an efficient method, AutoLRS, which automatically\noptimizes the LR for each training stage by modeling training dynamics. AutoLRS\naims to find an LR applied to every $\\tau$ steps that minimizes the resulted\nvalidation loss. We solve this black-box optimization on the fly by Bayesian\noptimization (BO). However, collecting training instances for BO requires a\nsystem to evaluate each LR queried by BO's acquisition function for $\\tau$\nsteps, which is prohibitively expensive in practice. Instead, we apply each\ncandidate LR for only $\\tau'\\ll\\tau$ steps and train an exponential model to\npredict the validation loss after $\\tau$ steps. This mutual-training process\nbetween BO and the loss-prediction model allows us to limit the training steps\ninvested in the BO search. We demonstrate the advantages and the generality of\nAutoLRS through extensive experiments of training DNNs for tasks from diverse\ndomains using different optimizers. The LR schedules auto-generated by AutoLRS\nlead to a speedup of $1.22\\times$, $1.43\\times$, and $1.5\\times$ when training\nResNet-50, Transformer, and BERT, respectively, compared to the LR schedules in\ntheir original papers, and an average speedup of $1.31\\times$ over\nstate-of-the-art heavily-tuned LR schedules.",

          "description": "We present a general technique for constructing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\ncapable of using multi-relational domain knowledge. The technique is based on\nmode-directed inverse entailment (MDIE) developed in Inductive Logic\nProgramming (ILP). Given a data instance $e$ and background knowledge $B$, MDIE\nidentifies a most-specific logical formula $\\bot_B(e)$ that contains all the\nrelational information in $B$ that is related to $e$. We transform $\\bot_B(e)$\ninto a corresponding \"bottom-graph\" that can be processed for use by standard\nGNN implementations. This transformation allows a principled way of\nincorporating generic background knowledge into GNNs: we use the term `BotGNN'\nfor this form of graph neural networks. For several GNN variants, using\nreal-world datasets with substantial background knowledge, we show that BotGNNs\nperform significantly better than both GNNs without background knowledge and a\nrecently proposed simplified technique for including domain knowledge into\nGNNs. We also provide experimental evidence comparing BotGNNs favourably to\nmulti-layer perceptrons (MLPs) that use features representing a\n\"propositionalised\" form of the background knowledge; and BotGNNs to a standard\nILP based on the use of most-specific clauses.

In this paper, we analyze privacy amplification properties of a\nnew operation, sampling from the posterior, that is used in Bayesian inference.\nIn particular, we look at Bernoulli sampling from a posterior that is described\nby a differentially private parameter. We provide an algorithm to compute the\namplification factor in this setting, and establish upper and lower bounds on\nthis factor. Finally, we look at what happens when we draw k posterior samples\ninstead of one.",

We claim that\nsome states are inherently unsafe no matter what policy we choose, while for\nother states there exist policies ensuring safety, where we say such states and\npolicies are feasible. By constructing a statewise Lagrange function available\non RL sampling and adopting an additional neural network to approximate the\nstatewise Lagrange multiplier, we manage to obtain the optimal feasible policy\nwhich ensures safety for each feasible state and the safest possible policy for\ninfeasible states. Furthermore, the trained multiplier net can indicate whether\na given state is feasible or not through the statewise complementary slackness\ncondition.

          "description": "Mini-batch sub-sampling (MBSS) is favored in deep neural network training to\nreduce the computational cost. Still, it introduces an inherent sampling error,\nmaking the selection of appropriate learning rates challenging. The sampling\nerrors can manifest either as a bias or variances in a line search. Dynamic\nMBSS re-samples a mini-batch at every function evaluation. Hence, dynamic MBSS\nresults in point-wise discontinuous loss functions with smaller bias but larger\nvariance than static sampled loss functions. However, dynamic MBSS has the\nadvantage of having larger data throughput during training but requires the\ncomplexity regarding discontinuities to be resolved. This study extends the\ngradient-only surrogate (GOS), a line search method using quadratic\napproximation models built with only directional derivative information, for\ndynamic MBSS loss functions. We propose a gradient-only approximation line\nsearch (GOALS) with strong convergence characteristics with defined optimality\ncriterion. We investigate GOALS's performance by applying it on various\noptimizers that include SGD, RMSprop and Adam on ResNet-18 and EfficientNetB0.\nWe also compare GOALS's against the other existing learning rate methods. We\nquantify both the best performing and most robust algorithms. For the latter,\nwe introduce a relative robust criterion that allows us to quantify the\ndifference between an algorithm and the best performing algorithm for a given\nproblem. The results show that training a model with the recommended learning\nrate for a class of search directions helps to reduce the model errors in\nmultimodal cases.",

          "description": "Quantization is a technique used in deep neural networks (DNNs) to increase\nexecution performance and hardware efficiency. Uniform post-training\nquantization (PTQ) methods are common, since they can be implemented\nefficiently in hardware and do not require extensive hardware resources or a\ntraining set. Mapping FP32 models to INT8 using uniform PTQ yields models with\nnegligible accuracy degradation; however, reducing precision below 8 bits with\nPTQ is challenging, as accuracy degradation becomes noticeable, due to the\nincrease in quantization noise. In this paper, we propose a sparsity-aware\nquantization (SPARQ) method, in which the unstructured and dynamic activation\nsparsity is leveraged in different representation granularities. 4-bit\nquantization, for example, is employed by dynamically examining the bits of\n8-bit values and choosing a window of 4 bits, while first skipping zero-value\nbits. Moreover, instead of quantizing activation-by-activation to 4 bits, we\nfocus on pairs of 8-bit activations and examine whether one of the two is equal\nto zero. If one is equal to zero, the second can opportunistically use the\nother's 4-bit budget; if both do not equal zero, then each is dynamically\nquantized to 4 bits, as described. SPARQ achieves minor accuracy degradation,\n2x speedup over widely used hardware architectures, and a practical hardware\nimplementation. The code is available at https://github.com/gilshm/sparq.",

In this work, we extend\nthe above model in two directions: (i) We consider the general combinatorial\nsetting where more than one arms can be played at each round, subject to\nfeasibility constraints. (ii) We allow the blocking time of each arm to be\nstochastic. We first study the computational/unconditional hardness of the\nabove setting and identify the necessary conditions for the problem to become\ntractable (even in an approximate sense). Based on these conditions, we provide\na tight analysis of the approximation guarantee of a natural greedy heuristic\nthat always plays the maximum expected reward feasible subset among the\navailable (non-blocked) arms. When the arms' expected rewards are unknown, we\nadapt the above heuristic into a bandit algorithm, based on UCB, for which we\nprovide sublinear (approximate) regret guarantees, matching the theoretical\nlower bounds in the limiting case of absence of delays.",

However,\nno final conclusions can be derived by just using this random noise, since it\nexcludes feature-dependent noise.

          "description": "The threats faced by cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in critical infrastructure\nhave motivated research into a multitude of attack detection mechanisms,\nincluding anomaly detectors based on neural network models. The effectiveness\nof anomaly detectors can be assessed by subjecting them to test suites of\nattacks, but less consideration has been given to adversarial attackers that\ncraft noise specifically designed to deceive them. While successfully applied\nin domains such as images and audio, adversarial attacks are much harder to\nimplement in CPSs due to the presence of other built-in defence mechanisms such\nas rule checkers(or invariant checkers). In this work, we present an\nadversarial attack that simultaneously evades the anomaly detectors and rule\ncheckers of a CPS. Inspired by existing gradient-based approaches, our\nadversarial attack crafts noise over the sensor and actuator values, then uses\na genetic algorithm to optimise the latter, ensuring that the neural network\nand the rule checking system are both deceived.We implemented our approach for\ntwo real-world critical infrastructure testbeds, successfully reducing the\nclassification accuracy of their detectors by over 50% on average, while\nsimultaneously avoiding detection by rule checkers. Finally, we explore whether\nthese attacks can be mitigated by training the detectors on adversarial\nsamples.",

          "description": "In complex lane change (LC) scenarios, semantic interpretation and safety\nanalysis of dynamic interactive pattern are necessary for autonomous vehicles\nto make appropriate decisions. This study proposes an unsupervised learning\nframework that combines primitive-based interactive pattern recognition methods\nand risk analysis methods. The Hidden Markov Model with the Gaussian mixture\nmodel (GMM-HMM) approach is developed to decompose the LC scenarios into\nprimitives. Then the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance based K-means\nclustering is applied to gather the primitives to 13 types of interactive\npatterns. Finally, this study considers two types of time-to-collision (TTC)\ninvolved in the LC process as indicators to analyze the risk of the interactive\npatterns and extract high-risk LC interactive patterns. The results obtained\nfrom The Highway Drone Dataset (highD) demonstrate that the identified LC\ninteractive patterns contain interpretable semantic information. This study\nexplores the spatiotemporal evolution law and risk formation mechanism of the\nLC interactive patterns and the findings are useful for comprehensively\nunderstanding the latent interactive patterns, improving the rationality and\nsafety of autonomous vehicle's decision-making.",

          "description": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective technique for training\ndecision-making agents through interactions with their environment. The advent\nof deep learning has been associated with highly notable successes with\nsequential decision making problems - such as defeating some of the\nhighest-ranked human players at Go. In digital advertising, real-time bidding\n(RTB) is a common method of allocating advertising inventory through real-time\nauctions. Bidding strategies need to incorporate logic for dynamically\nadjusting parameters in order to deliver pre-assigned campaign goals. Here we\ndiscuss techniques toward using RL to train bidding agents. As a campaign\nmetric we particularly focused on viewability: the percentage of inventory\nwhich goes on to be viewed by an end user.\n\nThis paper is presented as a survey of techniques and experiments which we\ndeveloped through the course of this research. We discuss expanding our\ntraining data to include edge cases by training on simulated interactions. We\ndiscuss the experimental results comparing the performance of several promising\nRL algorithms, and an approach to hyperparameter optimization of an\nactor/critic training pipeline through Bayesian optimization. Finally, we\npresent live-traffic tests of some of our RL agents against a rule-based\nfeedback-control approach, demonstrating the potential for this method as well\nas areas for further improvement. This paper therefore presents an arrangement\nof our findings in this quickly developing field, and ways that it can be\napplied to an RTB use case.",

          "description": "Learning Granger causality among event types on multi-type event sequences is\nan important but challenging task. Existing methods, such as the Multivariate\nHawkes processes, mostly assumed that each sequence is independent and\nidentically distributed. However, in many real-world applications, it is\ncommonplace to encounter a topological network behind the event sequences such\nthat an event is excited or inhibited not only by its history but also by its\ntopological neighbors. Consequently, the failure in describing the topological\ndependency among the event sequences leads to the error detection of the causal\nstructure. By considering the Hawkes processes from the view of temporal\nconvolution, we propose a Topological Hawkes processes (THP) to draw a\nconnection between the graph convolution in topology domain and the temporal\nconvolution in time domains. We further propose a Granger causality learning\nmethod on THP in a likelihood framework. The proposed method is featured with\nthe graph convolution-based likelihood function of THP and a sparse\noptimization scheme with an Expectation-Maximization of the likelihood\nfunction. Theoretical analysis and experiments on both synthetic and real-world\ndata demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

With the prevalence of\ngraph data in real-world applications, many methods have been proposed in\nrecent years to learn high-quality graph embedding vectors various types of\ngraphs.

This paper studies a fundamental problem of NoisyNNs: how to estimate\nthe uncontaminated NN weights from their noisy observations or manifestations.\nWhereas all prior works relied on the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation to\nmaximize the likelihood function of the estimated NN weights, this paper\ndemonstrates that the ML estimator is in general suboptimal.

          "description": "Robotic manipulation of cloth remains challenging for robotics due to the\ncomplex dynamics of the cloth, lack of a low-dimensional state representation,\nand self-occlusions. In contrast to previous model-based approaches that learn\na pixel-based dynamics model or a compressed latent vector dynamics, we propose\nto learn a particle-based dynamics model from a partial point cloud\nobservation. To overcome the challenges of partial observability, we infer\nwhich visible points are connected on the underlying cloth mesh. We then learn\na dynamics model over this visible connectivity graph. Compared to previous\nlearning-based approaches, our model poses strong inductive bias with its\nparticle based representation for learning the underlying cloth physics; it is\ninvariant to visual features; and the predictions can be more easily\nvisualized. We show that our method greatly outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art model-based and model-free reinforcement learning methods in\nsimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer where we\ndeploy the model trained in simulation on a Franka arm and show that the model\ncan successfully smooth different types of cloth from crumpled configurations.\nVideos can be found on our project website.",

However, the existing low-memory BLS implementation sacrifices the\ntesting accuracy as a price for efficient usage of memories, since it can no\nlonger obtain the generalized inverse or ridge solution for the output weights\nduring incremental learning, and it cannot work under the very small ridge\nparameter that is utilized in the original BLS. Accordingly, it is required to\ndevelop the low-memory BLS implementations, which can work under very small\nridge parameters and compute the generalized inverse or ridge solution for the\noutput weights in the process of incremental learning. In this paper, firstly\nwe propose the low-memory implementations for the recently proposed recursive\nand square-root BLS algorithms on added inputs and the recently proposed\nsquareroot BLS algorithm on added nodes, by simply processing a batch of inputs\nor nodes in each recursion. Since the recursive BLS implementation includes the\nrecursive updates of the inverse matrix that may introduce numerical\ninstabilities after a large number of iterations, and needs the extra\ncomputational load to decompose the inverse matrix into the Cholesky factor\nwhen cooperating with the proposed low-memory implementation of the square-root\nBLS algorithm on added nodes, we only improve the low-memory implementations of\nthe square-root BLS algorithms on added inputs and nodes, to propose the full\nlowmemory implementation of the square-root BLS algorithm.

          "description": "The increasing complexity of algorithms for analyzing medical data, including\nde-identification tasks, raises the possibility that complex algorithms are\nlearning not just the general representation of the problem, but specifics of\ngiven individuals within the data. Modern legal frameworks specifically\nprohibit the intentional or accidental distribution of patient data, but have\nnot addressed this potential avenue for leakage of such protected health\ninformation. Modern deep learning algorithms have the highest potential of such\nleakage due to complexity of the models. Recent research in the field has\nhighlighted such issues in non-medical data, but all analysis is likely to be\ndata and algorithm specific. We, therefore, chose to analyze a state-of-the-art\nfree-text de-identification algorithm based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)\nand its potential in encoding any individual in the training set. Using the\ni2b2 Challenge Data, we trained, then analyzed the model to assess whether the\noutput of the LSTM, before the compression layer of the classifier, could be\nused to estimate the membership of the training data. Furthermore, we used\ndifferent attacks including membership inference attack method to attack the\nmodel. Results indicate that the attacks could not identify whether members of\nthe training data were distinguishable from non-members based on the model\noutput. This indicates that the model does not provide any strong evidence into\nthe identification of the individuals in the training data set and there is not\nyet empirical evidence it is unsafe to distribute the model for general use.",

          "description": "Supervised deep learning has swiftly become a workhorse for accelerated MRI\nin recent years, offering state-of-the-art performance in image reconstruction\nfrom undersampled acquisitions. Training deep supervised models requires large\ndatasets of undersampled and fully-sampled acquisitions typically from a\nmatching set of subjects. Given scarce access to large medical datasets, this\nlimitation has sparked interest in unsupervised methods that reduce reliance on\nfully-sampled ground-truth data. A common framework is based on the deep image\nprior, where network-driven regularization is enforced directly during\ninference on undersampled acquisitions. Yet, canonical convolutional\narchitectures are suboptimal in capturing long-range relationships, and\nrandomly initialized networks may hamper convergence. To address these\nlimitations, here we introduce a novel unsupervised MRI reconstruction method\nbased on zero-Shot Learned Adversarial TransformERs (SLATER). SLATER embodies a\ndeep adversarial network with cross-attention transformer blocks to map noise\nand latent variables onto MR images. This unconditional network learns a\nhigh-quality MRI prior in a self-supervised encoding task. A zero-shot\nreconstruction is performed on undersampled test data, where inference is\nperformed by optimizing network parameters, latent and noise variables to\nensure maximal consistency to multi-coil MRI data. Comprehensive experiments on\nbrain MRI datasets clearly demonstrate the superior performance of SLATER\nagainst several state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.",

          "description": "Massive multiple-input multiple-output can obtain more performance gain by\nexploiting the downlink channel state information (CSI) at the base station\n(BS). Therefore, studying CSI feedback with limited communication resources in\nfrequency-division duplexing systems is of great importance. Recently, deep\nlearning (DL)-based CSI feedback has shown considerable potential. However, the\nexisting DL-based explicit feedback schemes are difficult to deploy because\ncurrent fifth-generation mobile communication protocols and systems are\ndesigned based on an implicit feedback mechanism. In this paper, we propose a\nDL-based implicit feedback architecture to inherit the low-overhead\ncharacteristic, which uses neural networks (NNs) to replace the precoding\nmatrix indicator (PMI) encoding and decoding modules. By using environment\ninformation, the NNs can achieve a more refined mapping between the precoding\nmatrix and the PMI compared with codebooks. The correlation between subbands is\nalso used to further improve the feedback performance. Simulation results show\nthat, for a single resource block (RB), the proposed architecture can save\n25.0% and 40.0% of overhead compared with Type I codebook under two antenna\nconfigurations, respectively.

          "description": "This work studies the statistical limits of uniform convergence for offline\npolicy evaluation (OPE) problems with model-based methods (for finite horizon\nMDP) and provides a unified view towards optimal learning for several\nwell-motivated offline tasks. Uniform OPE\n$\\sup_\\Pi|Q^\\pi-\\hat{Q}^\\pi|<\\epsilon$ (initiated by \\citet{yin2021near}) is a\nstronger measure than the point-wise (fixed policy) OPE and ensures offline\npolicy learning when $\\Pi$ contains all policies (global policy class). In this\npaper, we establish an $\\Omega(H^2 S/d_m\\epsilon^2)$ lower bound (over\nmodel-based family) for the global uniform OPE, where $d_m$ is the minimal\nstate-action probability induced by the behavior policy. Next, our main result\nestablishes an episode complexity of $\\tilde{O}(H^2/d_m\\epsilon^2)$ for\n\\emph{local} uniform convergence that applies to all \\emph{near-empirically\noptimal} policies for the MDPs with \\emph{stationary} transition. This result\nimplies the optimal sample complexity for offline learning and separates the\nlocal uniform OPE from the global case due to the extra $S$ factor.\nParamountly, the model-based method combining with our new analysis technique\n(singleton absorbing MDP) can be adapted to the new settings: offline\ntask-agnostic and the offline reward-free with optimal complexity\n$\\tilde{O}(H^2\\log(K)/d_m\\epsilon^2)$ ($K$ is the number of tasks) and\n$\\tilde{O}(H^2S/d_m\\epsilon^2)$ respectively, which provides a unified\nframework for simultaneously solving different offline RL problems.",

          "description": "In a dialogue system pipeline, a natural language generation (NLG) unit\nconverts the dialogue direction and content to a corresponding natural language\nrealization. A recent trend for dialogue systems is to first pre-train on large\ndatasets and then fine-tune in a supervised manner using datasets annotated\nwith application-specific features. Though novel behaviours can be learned from\ncustom annotation, the required effort severely bounds the quantity of the\ntraining set, and the application-specific nature limits the reuse. In light of\nthe recent success of data-driven approaches, we propose the novel future\nbridging NLG (FBNLG) concept for dialogue systems and simulators. The critical\nstep is for an FBNLG to accept a future user or system utterance to bridge the\npresent context towards. Future bridging enables self supervised training over\nannotation-free datasets, decoupled the training of NLG from the rest of the\nsystem. An FBNLG, pre-trained with massive datasets, is expected to apply in\nclassical or new dialogue scenarios with minimal adaptation effort. We evaluate\na prototype FBNLG to show that future bridging can be a viable approach to a\nuniversal few-shot NLG for task-oriented and chit-chat dialogues.",

          "description": "The issue of potential privacy leakage during centralized AI's model training\nhas drawn intensive concern from the public. A Parallel and Distributed\nComputing (or PDC) scheme, termed Federated Learning (FL), has emerged as a new\nparadigm to cope with the privacy issue by allowing clients to perform model\ntraining locally, without the necessity to upload their personal sensitive\ndata. In FL, the number of clients could be sufficiently large, but the\nbandwidth available for model distribution and re-upload is quite limited,\nmaking it sensible to only involve part of the volunteers to participate in the\ntraining process. The client selection policy is critical to an FL process in\nterms of training efficiency, the final model's quality as well as fairness. In\nthis paper, we will model the fairness guaranteed client selection as a\nLyapunov optimization problem and then a C2MAB-based method is proposed for\nestimation of the model exchange time between each client and the server, based\non which we design a fairness guaranteed algorithm termed RBCS-F for\nproblem-solving. The regret of RBCS-F is strictly bounded by a finite constant,\njustifying its theoretical feasibility. Barring the theoretical results, more\nempirical data can be derived from our real training experiments on public\ndatasets.",

          "description": "Time-series representation learning is a fundamental task for time-series\nanalysis. While significant progress has been made to achieve accurate\nrepresentations for downstream applications, the learned representations often\nlack interpretability and do not expose semantic meanings. Different from\nprevious efforts on the entangled feature space, we aim to extract the\nsemantic-rich temporal correlations in the latent interpretable factorized\nrepresentation of the data. Motivated by the success of disentangled\nrepresentation learning in computer vision, we study the possibility of\nlearning semantic-rich time-series representations, which remains unexplored\ndue to three main challenges: 1) sequential data structure introduces complex\ntemporal correlations and makes the latent representations hard to interpret,\n2) sequential models suffer from KL vanishing problem, and 3) interpretable\nsemantic concepts for time-series often rely on multiple factors instead of\nindividuals. To bridge the gap, we propose Disentangle Time Series (DTS), a\nnovel disentanglement enhancement framework for sequential data. Specifically,\nto generate hierarchical semantic concepts as the interpretable and\ndisentangled representation of time-series, DTS introduces multi-level\ndisentanglement strategies by covering both individual latent factors and group\nsemantic segments. We further theoretically show how to alleviate the KL\nvanishing problem: DTS introduces a mutual information maximization term, while\npreserving a heavier penalty on the total correlation and the dimension-wise KL\nto keep the disentanglement property. Experimental results on various\nreal-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the representations learned by\nDTS achieve superior performance in downstream applications, with high\ninterpretability of semantic concepts.",

          "description": "Vision transformers (ViT) have demonstrated impressive performance across\nvarious machine vision problems. These models are based on multi-head\nself-attention mechanisms that can flexibly attend to a sequence of image\npatches to encode contextual cues. An important question is how such\nflexibility in attending image-wide context conditioned on a given patch can\nfacilitate handling nuisances in natural images e.g., severe occlusions, domain\nshifts, spatial permutations, adversarial and natural perturbations. We\nsystematically study this question via an extensive set of experiments\nencompassing three ViT families and comparisons with a high-performing\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). We show and analyze the following\nintriguing properties of ViT: (a) Transformers are highly robust to severe\nocclusions, perturbations and domain shifts, e.g., retain as high as 60% top-1\naccuracy on ImageNet even after randomly occluding 80% of the image content.\n(b) The robust performance to occlusions is not due to a bias towards local\ntextures, and ViTs are significantly less biased towards textures compared to\nCNNs. When properly trained to encode shape-based features, ViTs demonstrate\nshape recognition capability comparable to that of human visual system,\npreviously unmatched in the literature. (c) Using ViTs to encode shape\nrepresentation leads to an interesting consequence of accurate semantic\nsegmentation without pixel-level supervision. (d) Off-the-shelf features from a\nsingle ViT model can be combined to create a feature ensemble, leading to high\naccuracy rates across a range of classification datasets in both traditional\nand few-shot learning paradigms. We show effective features of ViTs are due to\nflexible and dynamic receptive fields possible via the self-attention\nmechanism.",

The idea of the proposed approach is to\nuse Markov boundary information to identify a specific variable that can be\nremoved from the set of variables without affecting the statistical\ndependencies among the other variables. Having identified such a variable, we\ndiscover its neighborhood, remove that variable from the set of variables, and\nrecursively learn the causal structure over the remaining variables. We further\nprovide a lower bound on the number of CI tests required by any\nconstraint-based method.

This is particularly true when\ndata comes from complex systems where extensive structure is available, but\nmust be drawn from peripheral sources.

The sheaf-based approach\nthat we propose is suitably general enough to be useful in a range of\napplications, from analyzing sensor networks to understanding the feature space\nof a deep learning model.",

The Copernicus program,\nand Sentinel-1 (S1) in particular, offers the opportunity to monitor\nagricultural land at a continental scale and in a timely manner. However, so\nfar the potential of S1 has not been explored at such a scale. Capitalizing on\nthe unique LUCAS 2018 Copernicus in-situ survey, we present the first\ncontinental crop type map at 10-m spatial resolution for the EU based on S1A\nand S1B Synthetic Aperture Radar observations for the year 2018. Random forest\nclassification algorithms are tuned to detect 19 different crop types. We\nassess the accuracy of this EU crop map with three approaches. First, the\naccuracy is assessed with independent LUCAS core in-situ observations over the\ncontinent. Second, an accuracy assessment is done specifically for main crop\ntypes from farmers declarations from 6 EU member countries or regions totaling\n>3M parcels and 8.21 Mha. Finally, the crop areas derived by classification are\ncompared to the subnational (NUTS 2) area statistics reported by Eurostat. The\noverall accuracy for the map is reported as 80.3% when grouping main crop\nclasses and 76% when considering all 19 crop type classes separately. Highest\naccuracies are obtained for rape and turnip rape with user and produced\naccuracies higher than 96%. The correlation between the remotely sensed\nestimated and Eurostat reported crop area ranges from 0.93 (potatoes) to 0.99\n(rape and turnip rape). Finally, we discuss how the framework presented here\ncan underpin the operational delivery of in-season high-resolution based crop\nmapping.",

As a result, they could significantly slow down the\nconvergence of the global model we aim to build and also compromise its\nquality. In light of this, we propose FedProf, a novel protocol for optimizing\nFL under such circumstances without breaching data privacy. The key of our\napproach is using the global model to dynamically profile the latent\nrepresentations of data (termed representation footprints) on the clients. By\nmatching local footprints on clients against a baseline footprint on the\nserver, we adaptively score each client and adjust its probability of being\nselected each round so as to mitigate the impact of the clients with\nlow-quality data on the training process. We have conducted extensive\nexperiments on public data sets using various FL settings. The results show\nthat FedProf effectively reduces the number of communication rounds and overall\ntime (providing up to 4.5x speedup) for the global model to converge while\nimproving the accuracy of the final global model.",

Therefore, Extra Trees is selected as the\nbest classifier with a 100% and 99% of accuracy with, respectively,\ncross-validation technique and with new unseen data. Moreover, the 8 features\nselected are employed to assess the explainability of the model's results\ndenoting which features are more relevant in the model's output.",

          "description": "Random Forest (RFs) are among the most widely used Machine Learning (ML)\nclassifiers. Even though RFs are not interpretable, there are no dedicated\nnon-heuristic approaches for computing explanations of RFs. Moreover, there is\nrecent work on polynomial algorithms for explaining ML models, including naive\nBayes classifiers. Hence, one question is whether finding explanations of RFs\ncan be solved in polynomial time. This paper answers this question negatively,\nby proving that computing one PI-explanation of an RF is D^P-complete.\nFurthermore, the paper proposes a propositional encoding for computing\nexplanations of RFs, thus enabling finding PI-explanations with a SAT solver.\nThis contrasts with earlier work on explaining boosted trees (BTs) and neural\nnetworks (NNs), which requires encodings based on SMT/MILP. Experimental\nresults, obtained on a wide range of publicly available datasets, demontrate\nthat the proposed SAT-based approach scales to RFs of sizes common in practical\napplications. Perhaps more importantly, the experimental results demonstrate\nthat, for the vast majority of examples considered, the SAT-based approach\nproposed in this paper significantly outperforms existing heuristic approaches.",

          "description": "In the race to bring Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the edge, collaborative\nintelligence has emerged as a promising way to lighten the computation load on\nedge devices that run applications based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).\nTypically, a deep model is split at a certain layer into edge and cloud\nsub-models. The deep feature tensor produced by the edge sub-model is\ntransmitted to the cloud, where the remaining computationally intensive\nworkload is performed by the cloud sub-model. The communication channel between\nthe edge and cloud is imperfect, which will result in missing data in the deep\nfeature tensor received at the cloud side. In this study, we examine the\neffectiveness of four low-rank tensor completion methods in recovering missing\ndata in the deep feature tensor. We consider both sparse tensors, such as those\nproduced by the VGG16 model, as well as non-sparse tensors, such as those\nproduced by ResNet34 model.

          "description": "In this work we study the problem of measuring the fairness of a machine\nlearning model under noisy information. Focusing on group fairness metrics, we\ninvestigate the particular but common situation when the evaluation requires\ncontrolling for the confounding effect of covariate variables. In a practical\nsetting, we might not be able to jointly observe the covariate and group\ninformation, and a standard workaround is to then use proxies for one or more\nof these variables. Prior works have demonstrated the challenges with using a\nproxy for sensitive attributes, and strong independence assumptions are needed\nto provide guarantees on the accuracy of the noisy estimates. In contrast, in\nthis work we study using a proxy for the covariate variable and present a\ntheoretical analysis that aims to characterize weaker conditions under which\naccurate fairness evaluation is possible.\n\nFurthermore, our theory identifies potential sources of errors and decouples\nthem into two interpretable parts $\\gamma$ and $\\epsilon$. The first part\n$\\gamma$ depends solely on the performance of the proxy such as precision and\nrecall, whereas the second part $\\epsilon$ captures correlations between all\nthe variables of interest. We show that in many scenarios the error in the\nestimates is dominated by $\\gamma$ via a linear dependence, whereas the\ndependence on the correlations $\\epsilon$ only constitutes a lower order term.\nAs a result we expand the understanding of scenarios where measuring model\nfairness via proxies can be an effective approach. Finally, we compare, via\nsimulations, the theoretical upper-bounds to the distribution of simulated\nestimation errors and show that assuming some structure on the data, even weak,\nis key to significantly improve both theoretical guarantees and empirical\nresults.",

One\noption to reduce it to a fraction of this cost is to resort to mini-batching in\nconjunction with unadjusted discretizations of Langevin dynamics, in which case\nonly a random fraction of the data is used to estimate the gradient. However,\nthis leads to an additional noise in the dynamics and hence a bias on the\ninvariant measure which is sampled by the Markov chain. We advocate using the\nso-called Adaptive Langevin dynamics, which is a modification of standard\ninertial Langevin dynamics with a dynamical friction which automatically\ncorrects for the increased noise arising from mini-batching. We investigate the\npractical relevance of the assumptions underpinning Adaptive Langevin (constant\ncovariance for the estimation of the gradient), which are not satisfied in\ntypical models of Bayesian inference; and show how to extend the approach to\nmore general situations.",

          "description": "In real world settings, numerous constraints are present which are hard to\nspecify mathematically. However, for the real world deployment of reinforcement\nlearning (RL), it is critical that RL agents are aware of these constraints, so\nthat they can act safely. In this work, we consider the problem of learning\nconstraints from demonstrations of a constraint-abiding agent's behavior. We\nexperimentally validate our approach and show that our framework can\nsuccessfully learn the most likely constraints that the agent respects. We\nfurther show that these learned constraints are \\textit{transferable} to new\nagents that may have different morphologies and/or reward functions. Previous\nworks in this regard have either mainly been restricted to tabular (discrete)\nsettings, specific types of constraints or assume the environment's transition\ndynamics. In contrast, our framework is able to learn arbitrary\n\\textit{Markovian} constraints in high-dimensions in a completely model-free\nsetting.

          "description": "The popularity of multimodal sensors and the accessibility of the Internet\nhave brought us a massive amount of unlabeled multimodal data. Since existing\ndatasets and well-trained models are primarily unimodal, the modality gap\nbetween a unimodal network and unlabeled multimodal data poses an interesting\nproblem: how to transfer a pre-trained unimodal network to perform the same\ntask on unlabeled multimodal data? In this work, we propose multimodal\nknowledge expansion (MKE), a knowledge distillation-based framework to\neffectively utilize multimodal data without requiring labels. Opposite to\ntraditional knowledge distillation, where the student is designed to be\nlightweight and inferior to the teacher, we observe that a multimodal student\nmodel consistently denoises pseudo labels and generalizes better than its\nteacher. Extensive experiments on four tasks and different modalities verify\nthis finding. Furthermore, we connect the mechanism of MKE to semi-supervised\nlearning and offer both empirical and theoretical explanations to understand\nthe denoising capability of a multimodal student.",

          "description": "Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) is a powerful framework for tackling the\nsparse coding problem while also providing uncertainty quantification. However,\nthe most popular inference algorithms for SBL become too expensive for\nhigh-dimensional problems due to the need to maintain a large covariance\nmatrix. To resolve this issue, we introduce a new SBL inference algorithm that\navoids explicit computation of the covariance matrix, thereby saving\nsignificant time and space. Instead of performing costly matrix inversions, our\ncovariance-free method solves multiple linear systems to obtain provably\nunbiased estimates of the posterior statistics needed by SBL. These systems can\nbe solved in parallel, enabling further acceleration of the algorithm via\ngraphics processing units. In practice, our method can be up to thousands of\ntimes faster than existing baselines, reducing hours of computation time to\nseconds. We showcase how our new algorithm enables SBL to tractably tackle\nhigh-dimensional signal recovery problems, such as deconvolution of calcium\nimaging data and multi-contrast reconstruction of magnetic resonance images.\nFinally, we open-source a toolbox containing all of our implementations to\ndrive future research in SBL.",

To alleviate these challenges, prior work has\nprovided extensive supervision via a combination of reward-shaping,\nground-truth object-information, and expert demonstrations. In this work, we\nshow that one can learn object-interaction tasks from scratch without\nsupervision by learning an attentive object-model as an auxiliary task during\ntask learning with an object-centric relational RL agent. Our key insight is\nthat learning an object-model that incorporates object-attention into forward\nprediction provides a dense learning signal for unsupervised representation\nlearning of both objects and their relationships. This, in turn, enables faster\npolicy learning for an object-centric relational RL agent. We demonstrate our\nagent by introducing a set of challenging object-interaction tasks in the\nAI2Thor environment where learning with our attentive object-model is key to\nstrong performance. Specifically, we compare our agent and relational RL agents\nwith alternative auxiliary tasks to a relational RL agent equipped with\nground-truth object-information, and show that learning with our object-model\nbest closes the performance gap in terms of both learning speed and maximum\nsuccess rate.

The objective is to understand the convergence\nproperties of the invariant statistics when the underlying system of stochastic\ndifferential equations (SDEs) is empirically estimated with a supervised\nregression framework. Using the perturbation theory of ergodic Markov chains\nand the linear response theory, we deduce a linear dependence of the errors of\none-point and two-point invariant statistics on the error in the learning of\nthe drift and diffusion coefficients. More importantly, our study shows that\nthe usual $L^2$-norm characterization of the learning generalization error is\ninsufficient for achieving this linear dependence result. We find that\nsufficient conditions for such a linear dependence result are through learning\nalgorithms that produce a uniformly Lipschitz and consistent estimator in the\nhypothesis space that retains certain characteristics of the drift\ncoefficients, such as the usual linear growth condition that guarantees the\nexistence of solutions of the underlying SDEs.

However, methods used for this task assume the availability\nof complete and unambiguous labelmaps, with instance boundaries of objects, and\nclass labels for each pixel. This reliance on heavily annotated inputs\nrestricts the application of image synthesis techniques to real-world\napplications, especially under uncertainty due to weather, occlusion, or noise.\nOn the other hand, algorithms that can synthesize images from sparse labelmaps\nor sketches are highly desirable as tools that can guide content creators and\nartists to quickly generate scenes by simply specifying locations of a few\nobjects. In this paper, we address the problem of complex scene completion from\nsparse labelmaps. Under this setting, very few details about the scene (30\\% of\nobject instances) are available as input for image synthesis. We propose a\ntwo-stage deep network based method, called `Halluci-Net', that learns\nco-occurence relationships between objects in scenes, and then exploits these\nrelationships to produce a dense and complete labelmap. The generated dense\nlabelmap can then be used as input by state-of-the-art image synthesis\ntechniques like pix2pixHD to obtain the final image. The proposed method is\nevaluated on the Cityscapes dataset and it outperforms two baselines methods on\nperformance metrics like Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID), semantic\nsegmentation accuracy, and similarity in object co-occurrences.

DCT filters the entities to be communicated across the network\nthrough a simple hard-thresholding function, allowing only the most relevant\ninformation to pass through. For communication efficient DP, DCT compresses the\nparameter gradients sent to the parameter server during model synchronization.\nThe threshold is updated only once every few thousand iterations to reduce the\ncomputational overhead of compression. For communication efficient MP, DCT\nincorporates a novel technique to compress the activations and gradients sent\nacross the network during the forward and backward propagation, respectively.\nThis is done by identifying and updating only the most relevant neurons of the\nneural network for each training sample in the data. We evaluate DCT on\npublicly available natural language processing and recommender models and\ndatasets, as well as recommendation systems used in production at Facebook.

          "description": "In this paper, we consider online continuous DR-submodular maximization with\nlinear stochastic long-term constraints. Compared to the prior work on online\nsubmodular maximization, our setting introduces the extra complication of\nstochastic linear constraint functions that are i.i.d. generated at each round.\nTo be precise, at step $t\\in\\{1,\\dots,T\\}$, a DR-submodular utility function\n$f_t(\\cdot)$ and a constraint vector $p_t$, i.i.d. generated from an unknown\ndistribution with mean $p$, are revealed after committing to an action $x_t$\nand we aim to maximize the overall utility while the expected cumulative\nresource consumption $\\sum_{t=1}^T \\langle p,x_t\\rangle$ is below a fixed\nbudget $B_T$. Stochastic long-term constraints arise naturally in applications\nwhere there is a limited budget or resource available and resource consumption\nat each step is governed by stochastically time-varying environments. We\npropose the Online Lagrangian Frank-Wolfe (OLFW) algorithm to solve this class\nof online problems. We analyze the performance of the OLFW algorithm and we\nobtain sub-linear regret bounds as well as sub-linear cumulative constraint\nviolation bounds, both in expectation and with high probability.",

          "description": "In this work, we propose a data-driven scheme to initialize the parameters of\na deep neural network. This is in contrast to traditional approaches which\nrandomly initialize parameters by sampling from transformed standard\ndistributions. Such methods do not use the training data to produce a more\ninformed initialization. Our method uses a sequential layer-wise approach where\neach layer is initialized using its input activations. The initialization is\ncast as an optimization problem where we minimize a combination of encoding and\ndecoding losses of the input activations, which is further constrained by a\nuser-defined latent code. The optimization problem is then restructured into\nthe well-known Sylvester equation, which has fast and efficient gradient-free\nsolutions. Our data-driven method achieves a boost in performance compared to\nrandom initialization methods, both before start of training and after training\nis over. We show that our proposed method is especially effective in few-shot\nand fine-tuning settings. We conclude this paper with analyses on time\ncomplexity and the effect of different latent codes on the recognition\nperformance.",

It is thus\ncrucial to develop automated models for the detection of abnormal EEGs related\nto epilepsy. This paper describes the development of a novel class of compact\nand efficient convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting abnormal time\nintervals and electrodes in EEGs for epilepsy. The designed model is inspired\nby a CNN developed for brain-computer interfacing called multichannel EEGNet\n(mEEGNet). Unlike the EEGNet, the proposed model, mEEGNet, has the same number\nof electrode inputs and outputs to detect abnormalities. The mEEGNet was\nevaluated with a clinical dataset consisting of 29 cases of juvenile and\nchildhood absence epilepsy labeled by a clinical expert. The labels were given\nto paroxysmal discharges visually observed in both ictal (seizure) and\ninterictal (nonseizure) intervals. Results showed that the mEEGNet detected\nabnormal EEGs with the area under the curve, F1-values, and sensitivity\nequivalent to or higher than those of existing CNNs. Moreover, the number of\nparameters is much smaller than other CNN models.

          "description": "Train machine learning models on sensitive user data has raised increasing\nprivacy concerns in many areas. Federated learning is a popular approach for\nprivacy protection that collects the local gradient information instead of real\ndata. One way to achieve a strict privacy guarantee is to apply local\ndifferential privacy into federated learning. However, previous works do not\ngive a practical solution due to three issues. First, the noisy data is close\nto its original value with high probability, increasing the risk of information\nexposure. Second, a large variance is introduced to the estimated average,\ncausing poor accuracy. Last, the privacy budget explodes due to the high\ndimensionality of weights in deep learning models. In this paper, we proposed a\nnovel design of local differential privacy mechanism for federated learning to\naddress the abovementioned issues. It is capable of making the data more\ndistinct from its original value and introducing lower variance. Moreover, the\nproposed mechanism bypasses the curse of dimensionality by splitting and\nshuffling model updates. A series of empirical evaluations on three commonly\nused datasets, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10, demonstrate that our solution\ncan not only achieve superior deep learning performance but also provide a\nstrong privacy guarantee at the same time.",

          "description": "The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect phishing emails is\nprimarily dependent on large-scale centralized datasets, which opens it up to a\nmyriad of privacy, trust, and legal issues. Moreover, organizations are loathed\nto share emails, given the risk of leakage of commercially sensitive\ninformation. So, it is uncommon to obtain sufficient emails to train a global\nAI model efficiently. Accordingly, privacy-preserving distributed and\ncollaborative machine learning, particularly Federated Learning (FL), is a\ndesideratum. Already prevalent in the healthcare sector, questions remain\nregarding the effectiveness and efficacy of FL-based phishing detection within\nthe context of multi-organization collaborations. To the best of our knowledge,\nthe work herein is the first to investigate the use of FL in email\nanti-phishing. This paper builds upon a deep neural network model, particularly\nRNN and BERT for phishing email detection. It analyzes the FL-entangled\nlearning performance under various settings, including balanced and\nasymmetrical data distribution. Our results corroborate comparable performance\nstatistics of FL in phishing email detection to centralized learning for\nbalanced datasets, and low organization counts. Moreover, we observe a\nvariation in performance when increasing organizational counts. For a fixed\ntotal email dataset, the global RNN based model suffers by a 1.8% accuracy drop\nwhen increasing organizational counts from 2 to 10. In contrast, BERT accuracy\nrises by 0.6% when going from 2 to 5 organizations. However, if we allow\nincreasing the overall email dataset with the introduction of new organizations\nin the FL framework, the organizational level performance is improved by\nachieving a faster convergence speed. Besides, FL suffers in its overall global\nmodel performance due to highly unstable outputs if the email dataset\ndistribution is highly asymmetric.",

          "description": "This work attempts to provide a plausible theoretical framework that aims to\ninterpret modern deep (convolutional) networks from the principles of data\ncompression and discriminative representation. We show that for\nhigh-dimensional multi-class data, the optimal linear discriminative\nrepresentation maximizes the coding rate difference between the whole dataset\nand the average of all the subsets. We show that the basic iterative gradient\nascent scheme for optimizing the rate reduction objective naturally leads to a\nmulti-layer deep network, named ReduNet, that shares common characteristics of\nmodern deep networks. The deep layered architectures, linear and nonlinear\noperators, and even parameters of the network are all explicitly constructed\nlayer-by-layer via forward propagation, instead of learned via back\npropagation. All components of so-obtained \"white-box\" network have precise\noptimization, statistical, and geometric interpretation. Moreover, all linear\noperators of the so-derived network naturally become multi-channel convolutions\nwhen we enforce classification to be rigorously shift-invariant. The derivation\nalso indicates that such a deep convolution network is significantly more\nefficient to construct and learn in the spectral domain. Our preliminary\nsimulations and experiments clearly verify the effectiveness of both the rate\nreduction objective and the associated ReduNet.

          "description": "In intelligent transportation system, the key problem of traffic forecasting\nis how to extract the periodic temporal dependencies and complex spatial\ncorrelation. Current state-of-the-art methods for traffic flow prediction are\nbased on graph architectures and sequence learning models, but they do not\nfully exploit spatial-temporal dynamic information in traffic system.\nSpecifically, the temporal dependence of short-range is diluted by recurrent\nneural networks, and existing sequence model ignores local spatial information\nbecause the convolution operation uses global average pooling. Besides, there\nwill be some traffic accidents during the transitions of objects causing\ncongestion in the real world that trigger increased prediction deviation. To\novercome these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Conv-sequence\nLearning (STCL), in which a focused temporal block uses unidirectional\nconvolution to effectively capture short-term periodic temporal dependence, and\na spatial-temporal fusion module is able to extract the dependencies of both\ninteractions and decrease the feature dimensions. Moreover, the accidents\nfeatures impact on local traffic congestion and position encoding is employed\nto detect anomalies in complex traffic situations. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on large-scale real-world tasks and verify the effectiveness of our\nproposed method.",

Existing approaches are usually guided by the test coverage criteria,\ngenerating synthetic test cases that are often difficult for developers to read\nor understand. In this paper we propose AthenaTest, an approach that aims to\ngenerate unit test cases by learning from real-world focal methods and\ndeveloper-written testcases. We formulate unit test case generation as a\nsequence-to-sequence learning task, adopting a two-step training procedure\nconsisting of denoising pretraining on a large unsupervised Java corpus, and\nsupervised finetuning for a downstream translation task of generating unit\ntests. We investigate the impact of natural language and source code\npretraining, as well as the focal context information surrounding the focal\nmethod. Both techniques provide improvements in terms of validation loss, with\npretraining yielding 25% relative improvement and focal context providing\nadditional 11.1% improvement. We also introduce Methods2Test, the largest\npublicly available supervised parallel corpus of unit test case methods and\ncorresponding focal methods in Java, which comprises 780K test cases mined from\n91K open-source repositories from GitHub. We evaluate AthenaTest on five\ndefects4j projects, generating 25K passing test cases covering 43.7% of the\nfocal methods with only 30 attempts. We execute the test cases, collect test\ncoverage information, and compare them with test cases generated by EvoSuite\nand GPT-3, finding that our approach outperforms GPT-3 and has comparable\ncoverage w.r.t. EvoSuite. Finally, we survey professional developers on their\npreference in terms of readability, understandability, and testing\neffectiveness of the generated tests, showing overwhelmingly preference towards\nAthenaTest.",

          "description": "In quantum computing, the variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are well\nsuited for finding optimal combinations of things in specific applications\nranging from chemistry all the way to finance. The training of VQAs with\ngradient descent optimization algorithm has shown a good convergence. At an\nearly stage, the simulation of variational quantum circuits on noisy\nintermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices suffers from noisy outputs. Just like\nclassical deep learning, it also suffers from vanishing gradient problems. It\nis a realistic goal to study the topology of loss landscape, to visualize the\ncurvature information and trainability of these circuits in the existence of\nvanishing gradients. In this paper, we calculated the Hessian and visualized\nthe loss landscape of variational quantum classifiers at different points in\nparameter space. The curvature information of variational quantum classifiers\n(VQC) is interpreted and the loss function's convergence is shown. It helps us\nbetter understand the behavior of variational quantum circuits to tackle\noptimization problems efficiently. We investigated the variational quantum\nclassifiers via Hessian on quantum computers, started with a simple 4-bit\nparity problem to gain insight into the practical behavior of Hessian, then\nthoroughly analyzed the behavior of Hessian's eigenvalues on training the\nvariational quantum classifier for the Diabetes dataset.",

          "description": "Reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to create a decision-making agent for\nautonomous driving. However, previous approaches provide only black-box\nsolutions, which do not offer information on how confident the agent is about\nits decisions. An estimate of both the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of\nthe agent's decisions is fundamental for real-world applications of autonomous\ndriving. Therefore, this paper introduces the Ensemble Quantile Networks (EQN)\nmethod, which combines distributional RL with an ensemble approach, to obtain a\ncomplete uncertainty estimate. The distribution over returns is estimated by\nlearning its quantile function implicitly, which gives the aleatoric\nuncertainty, whereas an ensemble of agents is trained on bootstrapped data to\nprovide a Bayesian estimation of the epistemic uncertainty. A criterion for\nclassifying which decisions that have an unacceptable uncertainty is also\nintroduced. The results show that the EQN method can balance risk and time\nefficiency in different occluded intersection scenarios, by considering the\nestimated aleatoric uncertainty. Furthermore, it is shown that the trained\nagent can use the epistemic uncertainty information to identify situations that\nthe agent has not been trained for and thereby avoid making unfounded,\npotentially dangerous, decisions outside of the training distribution.",

One of\nthe most promising methods to estimate the harvest is berry counting, as it can\nbe approached non-destructively, and its process can be automated. In this\narticle, we present a method that addresses the challenge of occluded berries\nwith leaves to obtain a more accurate estimate of the number of berries that\nwill enable a better estimate of the harvest. We use generative adversarial\nnetworks, a deep learning-based approach that generates a likely scenario\nbehind the leaves exploiting learned patterns from images with non-occluded\nberries. Our experiments show that the estimate of the number of berries after\napplying our method is closer to the manually counted reference. In contrast to\napplying a factor to the berry count, our approach better adapts to local\nconditions by directly involving the appearance of the visible berries.\nFurthermore, we show that our approach can identify which areas in the image\nshould be changed by adding new berries without explicitly requiring\ninformation about hidden areas.",

          "description": "In causal graphical models based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), directed\npaths represent causal pathways between the corresponding variables. The\nvariable at the beginning of such a path is referred to as an ancestor of the\nvariable at the end of the path. Ancestral relations between variables play an\nimportant role in causal modeling. In existing literature on structure\nlearning, these relations are usually deduced from learned structures and used\nfor orienting edges or formulating constraints of the space of possible DAGs.\nHowever, they are usually not posed as immediate target of inference. In this\nwork we investigate the graphical characterization of ancestral relations via\nCPDAGs and d-separation relations. We propose a framework that can learn\ndefinite non-ancestral relations without first learning the skeleton. This\nframe-work yields structural information that can be used in both score- and\nconstraint-based algorithms to learn causal DAGs more efficiently.",

          "description": "We show that the popular reinforcement learning (RL) strategy of estimating\nthe state-action value (Q-function) by minimizing the mean squared Bellman\nerror leads to a regression problem with confounding, the inputs and output\nnoise being correlated. Hence, direct minimization of the Bellman error can\nresult in significantly biased Q-function estimates. We explain why fixing the\ntarget Q-network in Deep Q-Networks and Fitted Q Evaluation provides a way of\novercoming this confounding, thus shedding new light on this popular but not\nwell understood trick in the deep RL literature. An alternative approach to\naddress confounding is to leverage techniques developed in the causality\nliterature, notably instrumental variables (IV). We bring together here the\nliterature on IV and RL by investigating whether IV approaches can lead to\nimproved Q-function estimates. This paper analyzes and compares a wide range of\nrecent IV methods in the context of offline policy evaluation (OPE), where the\ngoal is to estimate the value of a policy using logged data only. By applying\ndifferent IV techniques to OPE, we are not only able to recover previously\nproposed OPE methods such as model-based techniques but also to obtain\ncompetitive new techniques. We find empirically that state-of-the-art OPE\nmethods are closely matched in performance by some IV methods such as AGMM,\nwhich were not developed for OPE.

Economical and rapid\ntesting, as well as diagnosis, is urgently needed to control the pandemic. At\npresent, the Covid-19 testing is costly and time-consuming. Chest X-Ray (CXR)\ntesting can be the fastest, scalable, and non-invasive method. The existing\nmethods suffer due to the limited CXR samples available from Covid-19.

This is possible due to a Gaussian equivalence stating that\nthe key metrics of interest, such as the training and test errors, can be fully\ncaptured by an appropriately chosen Gaussian model. We provide three strands of\nrigorous, analytical and numerical evidence corroborating this equivalence.\nFirst, we establish rigorous conditions for the Gaussian equivalence to hold in\nthe case of single-layer generative models, as well as deterministic rates for\nconvergence in distribution. Second, we leverage this equivalence to derive a\nclosed set of equations describing the generalisation performance of two widely\nstudied machine learning problems: two-layer neural networks trained using\none-pass stochastic gradient descent, and full-batch pre-learned features or\nkernel methods.

We examine the case of a structural probe\n(Hewitt and Manning, 2019), which aims to investigate the encoding of syntactic\nstructure in contextual representations through learning only linear\ntransformations. By observing that the structural probe learns a metric, we are\nable to kernelize it and develop a novel non-linear variant with an identical\nnumber of parameters. We test on 6 languages and find that the radial-basis\nfunction (RBF) kernel, in conjunction with regularization, achieves a\nstatistically significant improvement over the baseline in all languages --\nimplying that at least part of the syntactic knowledge is encoded non-linearly.\nWe conclude by discussing how the RBF kernel resembles BERT's self-attention\nlayers and speculate that this resemblance leads to the RBF-based probe's\nstronger performance.",

          "description": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained using stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD)-based optimizers. Recently, the adaptive moment estimation (Adam)\noptimizer has become very popular due to its adaptive momentum, which tackles\nthe dying gradient problem of SGD. Nevertheless, existing optimizers are still\nunable to exploit the optimization curvature information efficiently. This\npaper proposes a new AngularGrad optimizer that considers the behavior of the\ndirection/angle of consecutive gradients. This is the first attempt in the\nliterature to exploit the gradient angular information apart from its\nmagnitude. The proposed AngularGrad generates a score to control the step size\nbased on the gradient angular information of previous iterations. Thus, the\noptimization steps become smoother as a more accurate step size of immediate\npast gradients is captured through the angular information. Two variants of\nAngularGrad are developed based on the use of Tangent or Cosine functions for\ncomputing the gradient angular information. Theoretically, AngularGrad exhibits\nthe same regret bound as Adam for convergence purposes.

Moreover,\nthe robustness evaluation is often imprecise, making it difficult to identify\npromising approaches. We analyze the classification decisions of 19 different\nstate-of-the-art neural networks trained to be robust against adversarial\nattacks. Our findings suggest that current untargeted adversarial attacks\ninduce misclassification towards only a limited amount of different classes.\nAdditionally, we observe that both over- and under-confidence in model\npredictions result in an inaccurate assessment of model robustness.

Unfortunately, these methods are\ncompute-demanding and memory-intensive.

We compare four\nsupervised learning techniques on different classification scenarios and\ncharacterize the overall NILM pipeline's implementation on a MCU-based Smart\nMeasurement Node. Experimental results demonstrate that optimizing the feature\nspace enables edge MCU-based NILM with 95.15% accuracy, resulting in a small\ndrop compared to the most-accurate feature vector deployment (96.19%) while\nachieving up to 5.45x speed-up and 80.56% storage reduction.

          "description": "Pelvic ring disruptions result from blunt injury mechanisms and are often\nfound in patients with multi-system trauma. To grade pelvic fracture severity\nin trauma victims based on whole-body CT, the Tile AO/OTA classification is\nfrequently used. Due to the high volume of whole-body trauma CTs generated in\nbusy trauma centers, an automated approach to Tile classification would provide\nsubstantial value, e.,g., to prioritize the reading queue of the attending\ntrauma radiologist. In such scenario, an automated method should perform\ngrading based on a transparent process and based on interpretable features to\nenable interaction with human readers and lower their workload by offering\ninsights from a first automated read of the scan. This paper introduces an\nautomated yet interpretable pelvic trauma decision support system to assist\nradiologists in fracture detection and Tile grade classification. The method\noperates similarly to human interpretation of CT scans and first detects\ndistinct pelvic fractures on CT with high specificity using a Faster-RCNN model\nthat are then interpreted using a structural causal model based on clinical\nbest practices to infer an initial Tile grade. The Bayesian causal model and\nfinally, the object detector are then queried for likely co-occurring fractures\nthat may have been rejected initially due to the highly specific operating\npoint of the detector, resulting in an updated list of detected fractures and\ncorresponding final Tile grade. Our method is transparent in that it provides\nfinding location and type using the object detector, as well as information on\nimportant counterfactuals that would invalidate the system's recommendation and\nachieves an AUC of 83.3%/85.1% for translational/rotational instability.\nDespite being designed for human-machine teaming, our approach does not\ncompromise on performance compared to previous black-box approaches.",

The classifiers are trained to\ndiscriminate the reference motion from the motion generated by the imitation\npolicy, while the policy is rewarded for fooling the discriminators.

          "description": "Deep learning (DL) has achieved unprecedented success in a variety of tasks.\nHowever, DL systems are notoriously difficult to test and debug due to the lack\nof explainability of DL models and the huge test input space to cover.\nGenerally speaking, it is relatively easy to collect a massive amount of test\ndata, but the labeling cost can be quite high. Consequently, it is essential to\nconduct test selection and label only those selected \"high quality\"\nbug-revealing test inputs for test cost reduction.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel test prioritization technique that brings\norder into the unlabeled test instances according to their bug-revealing\ncapabilities, namely TestRank. Different from existing solutions, TestRank\nleverages both intrinsic attributes and contextual attributes of test instances\nwhen prioritizing them. To be specific, we first build a similarity graph on\ntest instances and training samples, and we conduct graph-based semi-supervised\nlearning to extract contextual features. Then, for a particular test instance,\nthe contextual features extracted from the graph neural network (GNN) and the\nintrinsic features obtained with the DL model itself are combined to predict\nits bug-revealing probability. Finally, TestRank prioritizes unlabeled test\ninstances in descending order of the above probability value. We evaluate the\nperformance of TestRank on a variety of image classification datasets.\nExperimental results show that the debugging efficiency of our method\nsignificantly outperforms existing test prioritization techniques.",

          "description": "This is a short note on the performance of the ALI-G algorithm (Berrada et\nal., 2020) as reported in (Loizou et al., 2021). ALI-G (Berrada et al., 2020)\nand SPS (Loizou et al., 2021) are both adaptations of the Polyak step-size to\noptimize machine learning models that can interpolate the training data. The\nmain algorithmic differences are that (1) SPS employs a multiplicative constant\nin the denominator of the learning-rate while ALI-G uses an additive constant,\nand (2) SPS uses an iteration-dependent maximal learning-rate while ALI-G uses\na constant one. There are also differences in the analysis provided by the two\nworks, with less restrictive assumptions proposed in (Loizou et al., 2021). In\ntheir experiments, (Loizou et al., 2021) did not use momentum for ALI-G (which\nis a standard part of the algorithm) or standard hyper-parameter tuning (for\ne.g. learning-rate and regularization). Hence this note as a reference for the\nimproved performance that ALI-G can obtain with well-chosen hyper-parameters.\nIn particular, we show that when training a ResNet-34 on CIFAR-10 and\nCIFAR-100, the performance of ALI-G can reach respectively 93.5% (+6%) and 76%\n(+8%) with a very small amount of tuning. Thus ALI-G remains a very competitive\nmethod for training interpolating neural networks.",

Gradient compression methods can be\nused to alleviate this problem, and a recent line of work shows that SGD\naugmented with gradient compression converges to an $\\varepsilon$-first-order\nstationary point. In this paper we extend these results to convergence to an\n$\\varepsilon$-second-order stationary point ($\\varepsilon$-SOSP), which is to\nthe best of our knowledge the first result of this type. In addition, we show\nthat, when the stochastic gradient is not Lipschitz, compressed SGD with\nRandomK compressor converges to an $\\varepsilon$-SOSP with the same number of\niterations as uncompressed SGD [Jin et al.,2021] (JACM), while improving the\ntotal communication by a factor of $\\tilde \\Theta(\\sqrt{d}\n\\varepsilon^{-3/4})$, where $d$ is the dimension of the optimization problem.\nWe present additional results for the cases when the compressor is arbitrary\nand when the stochastic gradient is Lipschitz.",

          "description": "Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine-learning paradigm, in\nwhich a global server iteratively averages the model parameters of local users\nwithout accessing their data.

Knowledge Distillation has recently emerged to tackle this issue, by\nrefining the server model using aggregated knowledge from heterogeneous users,\nother than directly averaging their model parameters.

Given the large number of designs\nthat can be generated from even a small set of modules, it becomes impractical\nto create a new system-wide controller for each design. Instead, we construct a\nmodular control policy that handles a broad class of designs. We take the view\nthat a module is both form and function, i.e. both mechanism and controller. As\nthe modules are physically re-configured, the policy automatically\nre-configures to match the kinematic structure.

In addition, we enforce\nconsistency on the temporal position of states via a normalized position\nestimator function, to align the trajectories across the two domains. Once this\ncorrespondence is found, we can directly transfer the demonstrations on one\ndomain to the other and use it for imitation.

TCN-VO$_2$ A showed strong\nprediction accuracy (mean, 95% CI) across all exercise intensities (-22\nml.min$^{-1}$, [-262, 218]), spanning transitions from low-moderate (-23\nml.min$^{-1}$, [-250, 204]), low-heavy (14 ml.min$^{-1}$, [-252, 280]),\nventilatory threshold-heavy (-49 ml.min$^{-1}$, [-274, 176]), and maximal (-32\nml.min$^{-1}$, [-261, 197]) exercise. Second-by-second classification of\nphysical activity across 16090 s of predicted VO$_2$ was able to discern\nbetween vigorous, moderate, and light activity with high accuracy (94.1%). This\nsystem enables quantitative aerobic activity monitoring in non-laboratory\nsettings across a range of exercise intensities using wearable sensors for\nmonitoring exercise prescription adherence and personal fitness.",

          "description": "In the image classification task, the most common approach is to resize all\nimages in a dataset to a unique shape, while reducing their precision to a size\nwhich facilitates experimentation at scale. This practice has benefits from a\ncomputational perspective, but it entails negative side-effects on performance\ndue to loss of information and image deformation. In this work we introduce the\nMAMe dataset, an image classification dataset with remarkable high resolution\nand variable shape properties. The goal of MAMe is to provide a tool for\nstudying the impact of such properties in image classification, while\nmotivating research in the field. The MAMe dataset contains thousands of\nartworks from three different museums, and proposes a classification task\nconsisting on differentiating between 29 mediums (i.e. materials and\ntechniques) supervised by art experts. After reviewing the singularity of MAMe\nin the context of current image classification tasks, a thorough description of\nthe task is provided, together with dataset statistics. Experiments are\nconducted to evaluate the impact of using high resolution images, variable\nshape inputs and both properties at the same time. Results illustrate the\npositive impact in performance when using high resolution images, while\nhighlighting the lack of solutions to exploit variable shapes. An additional\nexperiment exposes the distinctiveness between the MAMe dataset and the\nprototypical ImageNet dataset. Finally, the baselines are inspected using\nexplainability methods and expert knowledge, to gain insights on the challenges\nthat remain ahead.",

          "description": "In many real-world problems, complex dependencies are present both among\nsamples and among features. The Kronecker sum or the Cartesian product of two\ngraphs, each modeling dependencies across features and across samples, has been\nused as an inverse covariance matrix for a matrix-variate Gaussian\ndistribution, as an alternative to a Kronecker-product inverse covariance\nmatrix, due to its more intuitive sparse structure. However, the existing\nmethods for sparse Kronecker-sum inverse covariance estimation are limited in\nthat they do not scale to more than a few hundred features and samples and that\nthe unidentifiable parameters pose challenges in estimation. In this paper, we\nintroduce EiGLasso, a highly scalable method for sparse Kronecker-sum inverse\ncovariance estimation, based on Newton's method combined with\neigendecomposition of the two graphs for exploiting the structure of Kronecker\nsum. EiGLasso further reduces computation time by approximating the Hessian\nbased on the eigendecomposition of the sample and feature graphs. EiGLasso\nachieves quadratic convergence with the exact Hessian and linear convergence\nwith the approximate Hessian. We describe a simple new approach to estimating\nthe unidentifiable parameters that generalizes the existing methods. On\nsimulated and real-world data, we demonstrate that EiGLasso achieves two to\nthree orders-of-magnitude speed-up compared to the existing methods.",

In this study, we propose, SelfGNN, a novel contrastive\nself-supervised graph neural network (GNN) without relying on explicit\ncontrastive terms.

Furthermore, as data\naugmentation is key in contrastive learning, we introduce four feature\naugmentation (FA) techniques for graphs.

Moreover, FA incurs no computational overhead, unlike TA, which often has\nO(N^3) time complexity, N-number of nodes. Our empirical evaluation on seven\npublicly available real-world data shows that, SelfGNN is powerful and leads to\na performance comparable with SOTA supervised GNNs and always better than SOTA\nsemi-supervised and unsupervised GNNs.

These samples can\nbe partitioned into $\\ell$ groups, with samples having the same support\nbelonging to the same group. For a given budget of $m$ measurements per sample,\nthe goal is to recover the $\\ell$ underlying supports, in the absence of the\nknowledge of group labels. We study this problem with a focus on the\nmeasurement-constrained regime where $m$ is smaller than the support size $k$\nof each sample. We design a two-step procedure that estimates the union of the\nunderlying supports first, and then uses a spectral algorithm to estimate the\nindividual supports. Our proposed estimator can recover the supports with $m<k$\nmeasurements per sample, from $\\tilde{O}(k^{4}\\ell^{4}/m^{4})$ samples. Our\nguarantees hold for a general, generative model assumption on the samples and\nmeasurement matrices. We also provide results from experiments conducted on\nsynthetic data and on the MNIST dataset.",

          "description": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been attached great importance due to\ntheir biological plausibility and high energy-efficiency on neuromorphic chips.\nAs these chips are usually resource-constrained, the compression of SNNs is\nthus crucial along the road of practical use of SNNs. Most existing methods\ndirectly apply pruning approaches in artificial neural networks (ANNs) to SNNs,\nwhich ignore the difference between ANNs and SNNs, thus limiting the\nperformance of the pruned SNNs. Besides, these methods are only suitable for\nshallow SNNs. In this paper, inspired by synaptogenesis and synapse elimination\nin the neural system, we propose gradient rewiring (Grad R), a joint learning\nalgorithm of connectivity and weight for SNNs, that enables us to seamlessly\noptimize network structure without retrain. Our key innovation is to redefine\nthe gradient to a new synaptic parameter, allowing better exploration of\nnetwork structures by taking full advantage of the competition between pruning\nand regrowth of connections. The experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod achieves minimal loss of SNNs' performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset\nso far. Moreover, it reaches a $\\sim$3.5% accuracy loss under unprecedented\n0.73% connectivity, which reveals remarkable structure refining capability in\nSNNs. Our work suggests that there exists extremely high redundancy in deep\nSNNs. Our codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/Yanqi-Chen/Gradient-Rewiring .",

          "description": "Large ride-hailing platforms, such as DiDi, Uber and Lyft, connect tens of\nthousands of vehicles in a city to millions of ride demands throughout the day,\nproviding great promises for improving transportation efficiency through the\ntasks of order dispatching and vehicle repositioning. Existing studies,\nhowever, usually consider the two tasks in simplified settings that hardly\naddress the complex interactions between the two, the real-time fluctuations\nbetween supply and demand, and the necessary coordinations due to the\nlarge-scale nature of the problem. In this paper we propose a unified\nvalue-based dynamic learning framework (V1D3) for tackling both tasks. At the\ncenter of the framework is a globally shared value function that is updated\ncontinuously using online experiences generated from real-time platform\ntransactions. To improve the sample-efficiency and the robustness, we further\npropose a novel periodic ensemble method combining the fast online learning\nwith a large-scale offline training scheme that leverages the abundant\nhistorical driver trajectory data. This allows the proposed framework to adapt\nquickly to the highly dynamic environment, to generalize robustly to recurrent\npatterns and to drive implicit coordinations among the population of managed\nvehicles. Extensive experiments based on real-world datasets show considerably\nimprovements over other recently proposed methods on both tasks. Particularly,\nV1D3 outperforms the first prize winners of both dispatching and repositioning\ntracks in the KDD Cup 2020 RL competition, achieving state-of-the-art results\non improving both total driver income and user experience related metrics.",

          "description": "Chest X-rays of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are frequently\nobtained to determine the extent of lung disease and are a valuable source of\ndata for creating artificial intelligence models. Most work to date assessing\ndisease severity on chest imaging has focused on segmenting computed tomography\n(CT) images; however, given that CTs are performed much less frequently than\nchest X-rays for COVID-19 patients, automated lung lesion segmentation on chest\nX-rays could be clinically valuable. There currently exists a universal\nshortage of chest X-rays with ground truth COVID-19 lung lesion annotations,\nand manually contouring lung opacities is a tedious, labor-intensive task. To\naccelerate severity detection and augment the amount of publicly available\nchest X-ray training data for supervised deep learning (DL) models, we leverage\nexisting annotated CT images to generate frontal projection \"chest X-ray\"\nimages for training COVID-19 chest X-ray models. In this paper, we propose an\nautomated pipeline for segmentation of COVID-19 lung lesions on chest X-rays\ncomprised of a Mask R-CNN trained on a mixed dataset of open-source chest\nX-rays and coronal X-ray projections computed from annotated volumetric CTs. On\na test set containing 40 chest X-rays of COVID-19 positive patients, our model\nachieved IoU scores of 0.81 $\\pm$ 0.03 and 0.79 $\\pm$ 0.03 when trained on a\ndataset of 60 chest X-rays and on a mixed dataset of 10 chest X-rays and 50\nprojections from CTs, respectively. Our model far outperforms current baselines\nwith limited supervised training and may assist in automated COVID-19 severity\nquantification on chest X-rays.",

          "description": "While programming is one of the most broadly applicable skills in modern\nsociety, modern machine learning models still cannot code solutions to basic\nproblems. It can be difficult to accurately assess code generation performance,\nand there has been surprisingly little work on evaluating code generation in a\nway that is both flexible and rigorous. To meet this challenge, we introduce\nAPPS, a benchmark for code generation. Unlike prior work in more restricted\nsettings, our benchmark measures the ability of models to take an arbitrary\nnatural language specification and generate Python code fulfilling this\nspecification. Similar to how companies assess candidate software developers,\nwe then evaluate models by checking their generated code on test cases. Our\nbenchmark includes 10,000 problems, which range from having simple one-line\nsolutions to being substantial algorithmic challenges. We fine-tune large\nlanguage models on both GitHub and our training set, and we find that the\nprevalence of syntax errors is decreasing exponentially. Recent models such as\nGPT-Neo can pass approximately 15% of the test cases of introductory problems,\nso we find that machine learning models are beginning to learn how to code. As\nthe social significance of automatic code generation increases over the coming\nyears, our benchmark can provide an important measure for tracking\nadvancements.",

          "description": "In recommendation systems, the existence of the missing-not-at-random (MNAR)\nproblem results in the selection bias issue, degrading the recommendation\nperformance ultimately. A common practice to address MNAR is to treat missing\nentries from the so-called \"exposure\" perspective, i.e., modeling how an item\nis exposed (provided) to a user. Most of the existing approaches use heuristic\nmodels or re-weighting strategy on observed ratings to mimic the\nmissing-at-random setting. However, little research has been done to reveal how\nthe ratings are missing from a causal perspective. To bridge the gap, we\npropose an unbiased and robust method called DENC (De-bias Network Confounding\nin Recommendation) inspired by confounder analysis in causal inference. In\ngeneral, DENC provides a causal analysis on MNAR from both the inherent factors\n(e.g., latent user or item factors) and auxiliary network's perspective.\nParticularly, the proposed exposure model in DENC can control the social\nnetwork confounder meanwhile preserves the observed exposure information. We\nalso develop a deconfounding model through the balanced representation learning\nto retain the primary user and item features, which enables DENC generalize\nwell on the rating prediction. Extensive experiments on three datasets validate\nthat our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.",

          "description": "In this paper, we investigate a new multi-armed bandit (MAB) online learning\nmodel that considers real-world phenomena in many recommender systems: (i) the\nlearning agent cannot pull the arms by itself and thus has to offer rewards to\nusers to incentivize arm-pulling indirectly; and (ii) if users with specific\narm preferences are well rewarded, they induce a \"self-reinforcing\" effect in\nthe sense that they will attract more users of similar arm preferences. Besides\naddressing the tradeoff of exploration and exploitation, another key feature of\nthis new MAB model is to balance reward and incentivizing payment. The goal of\nthe agent is to maximize the total reward over a fixed time horizon $T$ with a\nlow total payment. Our contributions in this paper are two-fold: (i) We propose\na new MAB model with random arm selection that considers the relationship of\nusers' self-reinforcing preferences and incentives; and (ii) We leverage the\nproperties of a multi-color Polya urn with nonlinear feedback model to propose\ntwo MAB policies termed \"At-Least-$n$ Explore-Then-Commit\" and \"UCB-List\". We\nprove that both policies achieve $O(log T)$ expected regret with $O(log T)$\nexpected payment over a time horizon $T$. We conduct numerical simulations to\ndemonstrate and verify the performances of these two policies and study their\nrobustness under various settings.",

While promising, these approaches have two major\nlimitations. Their search space often does not contain the correct fix, and\ntheir search strategy ignores software knowledge such as strict code syntax.\nDue to these limitations, existing NMT-based techniques underperform the best\ntemplate-based approaches.\n\nWe propose CURE, a new NMT-based APR technique with three major novelties.\nFirst, CURE pre-trains a programming language (PL) model on a large software\ncodebase to learn developer-like source code before the APR task. Second, CURE\ndesigns a new code-aware search strategy that finds more correct fixes by\nfocusing on compilable patches and patches that are close in length to the\nbuggy code. Finally, CURE uses a subword tokenization technique to generate a\nsmaller search space that contains more correct fixes.\n\nOur evaluation on two widely-used benchmarks shows that CURE correctly fixes\n57 Defects4J bugs and 26 QuixBugs bugs, outperforming all existing APR\ntechniques on both benchmarks.",

          "description": "Determining the noise parameters of a Kalman Filter (KF) has been studied for\ndecades. A huge body of research focuses on the task of estimation of the noise\nunder various conditions, since precise noise estimation is considered\nequivalent to minimization of the filtering errors. However, we show that even\na small violation of the KF assumptions can significantly modify the effective\nnoise, breaking the equivalence between the tasks and making noise estimation\nan inferior strategy. We show that such violations are very common, and are\noften not trivial to handle or even notice. Consequentially, we argue that a\nrobust solution is needed - rather than choosing a dedicated model per problem.\nTo that end, we apply gradient-based optimization to the filtering errors\ndirectly, with relation to a simple and efficient parameterization of the\nsymmetric and positive-definite parameters of KF. In radar tracking and video\ntracking, we show that the optimization improves both the accuracy of KF and\nits robustness to design decisions. In addition, we demonstrate how an\noptimized neural network model can seem to reduce the errors significantly\ncompared to a KF - and how this reduction vanishes once the KF is optimized\nsimilarly. This indicates how complicated models can be wrongly identified as\nsuperior to KF, while in fact they were merely more optimized.",

          "description": "Error correction techniques have been used to refine the output sentences\nfrom automatic speech recognition (ASR) models and achieve a lower word error\nrate (WER) than original ASR outputs. Previous works usually use a\nsequence-to-sequence model to correct an ASR output sentence autoregressively,\nwhich causes large latency and cannot be deployed in online ASR services. A\nstraightforward solution to reduce latency, inspired by non-autoregressive\n(NAR) neural machine translation, is to use an NAR sequence generation model\nfor ASR error correction, which, however, comes at the cost of significantly\nincreased ASR error rate. In this paper, observing distinctive error patterns\nand correction operations (i.e., insertion, deletion, and substitution) in ASR,\nwe propose FastCorrect, a novel NAR error correction model based on edit\nalignment. In training, FastCorrect aligns each source token from an ASR output\nsentence to the target tokens from the corresponding ground-truth sentence\nbased on the edit distance between the source and target sentences, and\nextracts the number of target tokens corresponding to each source token during\nedition/correction, which is then used to train a length predictor and to\nadjust the source tokens to match the length of the target sentence for\nparallel generation. In inference, the token number predicted by the length\npredictor is used to adjust the source tokens for target sequence generation.\nExperiments on the public AISHELL-1 dataset and an internal industrial-scale\nASR dataset show the effectiveness of FastCorrect for ASR error correction: 1)\nit speeds up the inference by 6-9 times and maintains the accuracy (8-14% WER\nreduction) compared with the autoregressive correction model; and 2) it\noutperforms the accuracy of popular NAR models adopted in neural machine\ntranslation by a large margin.",

In\nmechanics, the new and active field of physics-informed neural networks\nattempts to mitigate this disadvantage by designing deep neural networks on the\nbasis of mechanical knowledge. By using this a priori knowledge, deeper and\nmore complex neural networks became feasible, since the mechanical assumptions\ncould be explained. However, the internal reasoning and explanation of neural\nnetwork parameters remain mysterious.\n\nComplementary to the physics-informed approach, we propose a first step\ntowards a physics-informing approach, which explains neural networks trained on\nmechanical data a posteriori. This novel explainable artificial intelligence\napproach aims at elucidating the black box of neural networks and their\nhigh-dimensional representations. Therein, the principal component analysis\ndecorrelates the distributed representations in cell states of RNNs and allows\nthe comparison to known and fundamental functions. The novel approach is\nsupported by a systematic hyperparameter search strategy that identifies the\nbest neural network architectures and training parameters. The findings of\nthree case studies on fundamental constitutive models (hyperelasticity,\nelastoplasticity, and viscoelasticity) imply that the proposed strategy can\nhelp identify numerical and analytical closed-form solutions to characterize\nnew materials.",

          "description": "Improving irradiance forecasting is critical to further increase the share of\nsolar in the energy mix. On a short time scale, fish-eye cameras on the ground\nare used to capture cloud displacements causing the local variability of the\nelectricity production. As most of the solar radiation comes directly from the\nSun, current forecasting approaches use its position in the image as a\nreference to interpret the cloud cover dynamics. However, existing Sun tracking\nmethods rely on external data and a calibration of the camera, which requires\naccess to the device. To address these limitations, this study introduces an\nimage-based Sun tracking algorithm to localise the Sun in the image when it is\nvisible and interpolate its daily trajectory from past observations. We\nvalidate the method on a set of sky images collected over a year at SIRTA's\nlab. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides robust smooth\nSun trajectories with a mean absolute error below 1% of the image size.",

          "description": "As big data becomes ubiquitous across domains, and more and more stakeholders\naspire to make the most of their data, demand for machine learning tools has\nspurred researchers to explore the possibilities of automated machine learning\n(AutoML). AutoML tools aim to make machine learning accessible for non-machine\nlearning experts (domain experts), to improve the efficiency of machine\nlearning, and to accelerate machine learning research. But although automation\nand efficiency are among AutoML's main selling points, the process still\nrequires human involvement at a number of vital steps, including understanding\nthe attributes of domain-specific data, defining prediction problems, creating\na suitable training data set, and selecting a promising machine learning\ntechnique. These steps often require a prolonged back-and-forth that makes this\nprocess inefficient for domain experts and data scientists alike, and keeps\nso-called AutoML systems from being truly automatic. In this review article, we\nintroduce a new classification system for AutoML systems, using a seven-tiered\nschematic to distinguish these systems based on their level of autonomy. We\nbegin by describing what an end-to-end machine learning pipeline actually looks\nlike, and which subtasks of the machine learning pipeline have been automated\nso far. We highlight those subtasks which are still done manually - generally\nby a data scientist - and explain how this limits domain experts' access to\nmachine learning. Next, we introduce our novel level-based taxonomy for AutoML\nsystems and define each level according to the scope of automation support\nprovided. Finally, we lay out a roadmap for the future, pinpointing the\nresearch required to further automate the end-to-end machine learning pipeline\nand discussing important challenges that stand in the way of this ambitious\ngoal.",

          "description": "This article addresses several fundamental issues associated with the\napproximation theory of neural networks, including the characterization of\napproximation spaces, the determination of the metric entropy of these spaces,\nand approximation rates of neural networks. For any activation function\n$\\sigma$, we show that the largest Banach space of functions which can be\nefficiently approximated by the corresponding shallow neural networks is the\nspace whose norm is given by the gauge of the closed convex hull of the set\n$\\{\\pm\\sigma(\\omega\\cdot x + b)\\}$. We characterize this space for the ReLU$^k$\nand cosine activation functions and, in particular, show that the resulting\ngauge space is equivalent to the spectral Barron space if $\\sigma=\\cos$ and is\nequivalent to the Barron space when $\\sigma={\\rm ReLU}$. Our main result\nestablishes the precise asymptotics of the $L^2$-metric entropy of the unit\nball of these guage spaces and, as a consequence, the optimal approximation\nrates for shallow ReLU$^k$ networks. The sharpest previous results hold only in\nthe special case that $k=0$ and $d=2$, where the metric entropy has been\ndetermined up to logarithmic factors. When $k > 0$ or $d > 2$, there is a\nsignificant gap between the previous best upper and lower bounds. We close all\nof these gaps and determine the precise asymptotics of the metric entropy for\nall $k \\geq 0$ and $d\\geq 2$, including removing the logarithmic factors\npreviously mentioned. Finally, we use these results to quantify how much is\nlost by Barron's spectral condition relative to the convex hull of\n$\\{\\pm\\sigma(\\omega\\cdot x + b)\\}$ when $\\sigma={\\rm ReLU}^k$.

          "description": "Catastrophic forgetting remains a severe hindrance to the broad application\nof artificial neural networks (ANNs), however, it continues to be a poorly\nunderstood phenomenon. Despite the extensive amount of work on catastrophic\nforgetting, we argue that it is still unclear how exactly the phenomenon should\nbe quantified, and, moreover, to what degree all of the choices we make when\ndesigning learning systems affect the amount of catastrophic forgetting. We use\nvarious testbeds from the reinforcement learning and supervised learning\nliterature to (1) provide evidence that the choice of which modern\ngradient-based optimization algorithm is used to train an ANN has a significant\nimpact on the amount of catastrophic forgetting and show that-surprisingly-in\nmany instances classical algorithms such as vanilla SGD experience less\ncatastrophic forgetting than the more modern algorithms such as Adam. We\nempirically compare four different existing metrics for quantifying\ncatastrophic forgetting and (2) show that the degree to which the learning\nsystems experience catastrophic forgetting is sufficiently sensitive to the\nmetric used that a change from one principled metric to another is enough to\nchange the conclusions of a study dramatically. Our results suggest that a much\nmore rigorous experimental methodology is required when looking at catastrophic\nforgetting.

          "description": "We introduce Invertible Dense Networks (i-DenseNets), a more parameter\nefficient extension of Residual Flows. The method relies on an analysis of the\nLipschitz continuity of the concatenation in DenseNets, where we enforce\ninvertibility of the network by satisfying the Lipschitz constant. Furthermore,\nwe propose a learnable weighted concatenation, which not only improves the\nmodel performance but also indicates the importance of the concatenated\nweighted representation. Additionally, we introduce the Concatenated LipSwish\nas activation function, for which we show how to enforce the Lipschitz\ncondition and which boosts performance. The new architecture, i-DenseNet,\nout-performs Residual Flow and other flow-based models on density estimation\nevaluated in bits per dimension, where we utilize an equal parameter budget.\nMoreover, we show that the proposed model out-performs Residual Flows when\ntrained as a hybrid model where the model is both a generative and a\ndiscriminative model.",

          "description": "Variational data assimilation optimizes for an initial state of a dynamical\nsystem such that its evolution fits observational data. The physical model can\nsubsequently be evolved into the future to make predictions. This principle is\na cornerstone of large scale forecasting applications such as numerical weather\nprediction. As such, it is implemented in current operational systems of\nweather forecasting agencies across the globe. However, finding a good initial\nstate poses a difficult optimization problem in part due to the non-invertible\nrelationship between physical states and their corresponding observations. We\nlearn a mapping from observational data to physical states and show how it can\nbe used to improve optimizability. We employ this mapping in two ways: to\nbetter initialize the non-convex optimization problem, and to reformulate the\nobjective function in better behaved physics space instead of observation\nspace. Our experimental results for the Lorenz96 model and a two-dimensional\nturbulent fluid flow demonstrate that this procedure significantly improves\nforecast quality for chaotic systems.",

          "description": "Tensor completion refers to the task of estimating the missing data from an\nincomplete measurement or observation, which is a core problem frequently\narising from the areas of big data analysis, computer vision, and network\nengineering. Due to the multidimensional nature of high-order tensors, the\nmatrix approaches, e.g., matrix factorization and direct matricization of\ntensors, are often not ideal for tensor completion and recovery. In this paper,\nwe introduce a unified low-rank and sparse enhanced Tucker decomposition model\nfor tensor completion. Our model possesses a sparse regularization term to\npromote a sparse core tensor of the Tucker decomposition, which is beneficial\nfor tensor data compression. Moreover, we enforce low-rank regularization terms\non factor matrices of the Tucker decomposition for inducing the low-rankness of\nthe tensor with a cheap computational cost. Numerically, we propose a\ncustomized ADMM with enough easy subproblems to solve the underlying model. It\nis remarkable that our model is able to deal with different types of real-world\ndata sets, since it exploits the potential periodicity and inherent correlation\nproperties appeared in tensors. A series of computational experiments on\nreal-world data sets, including internet traffic data sets, color images, and\nface recognition, demonstrate that our model performs better than many existing\nstate-of-the-art matricization and tensorization approaches in terms of\nachieving higher recovery accuracy.",

          "description": "While deep reinforcement learning excels at solving tasks where large amounts\nof data can be collected through virtually unlimited interaction with the\nenvironment, learning from limited interaction remains a key challenge. We\nposit that an agent can learn more efficiently if we augment reward\nmaximization with self-supervised objectives based on structure in its visual\ninput and sequential interaction with the environment. Our method,\nSelf-Predictive Representations(SPR), trains an agent to predict its own latent\nstate representations multiple steps into the future. We compute target\nrepresentations for future states using an encoder which is an exponential\nmoving average of the agent's parameters and we make predictions using a\nlearned transition model. On its own, this future prediction objective\noutperforms prior methods for sample-efficient deep RL from pixels. We further\nimprove performance by adding data augmentation to the future prediction loss,\nwhich forces the agent's representations to be consistent across multiple views\nof an observation. Our full self-supervised objective, which combines future\nprediction and data augmentation, achieves a median human-normalized score of\n0.415 on Atari in a setting limited to 100k steps of environment interaction,\nwhich represents a 55% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.\nNotably, even in this limited data regime, SPR exceeds expert human scores on 7\nout of 26 games.

On the other hand, the controller is on a lookout to detect the\npresence of the attacker and tries to enhance the detection performance by\ncarefully crafting its control signals. We study the trade-offs between the\ninformation acquired by the attacker from observations, the detection\ncapabilities of the controller, and the control cost. Specifically, we provide\ntight upper and lower bounds on the expected $\\epsilon$-deception time, namely\nthe time required by the controller to make a decision regarding the presence\nof an attacker with confidence at least $(1-\\epsilon\\log(1/\\epsilon))$. We then\nshow a probabilistic lower bound on the time that must be spent by the attacker\nlearning the system, in order for the controller to have a given expected\n$\\epsilon$-deception time. We show that this bound is also order optimal, in\nthe sense that if the attacker satisfies it, then there exists a learning\nalgorithm with the given order expected deception time.

          "description": "Majority of the existing graph neural networks (GNN) learn node embeddings\nthat encode their local neighborhoods but not their positions. Consequently,\ntwo nodes that are vastly distant but located in similar local neighborhoods\nmap to similar embeddings in those networks. This limitation prevents accurate\nperformance in predictive tasks that rely on position information. In this\npaper,we develop GraphReach, a position-aware inductive GNN that captures the\nglobal positions of nodes through reachability estimations with respect to a\nset of anchor nodes. The anchors are strategically selected so that\nreachability estimations across all the nodes are maximized. We show that this\ncombinatorial anchor selection problem is NP-hard and, consequently, develop a\ngreedy (1-1/e) approximation heuristic. Empirical evaluation against\nstate-of-the-art GNN architectures reveal that GraphReach provides up to 40%\nrelative improvement in accuracy. In addition, it is more robust to adversarial\nattacks.",

          "description": "With the explosive growth of e-commerce, online transaction fraud has become\none of the biggest challenges for e-commerce platforms. The historical\nbehaviors of users provide rich information for digging into the users' fraud\nrisk. While considerable efforts have been made in this direction, a\nlong-standing challenge is how to effectively exploit internal user information\nand provide explainable prediction results. In fact, the value variations of\nsame field from different events and the interactions of different fields\ninside one event have proven to be strong indicators for fraudulent behaviors.\nIn this paper, we propose the Dual Importance-aware Factorization Machines\n(DIFM), which exploits the internal field information among users' behavior\nsequence from dual perspectives, i.e., field value variations and field\ninteractions simultaneously for fraud detection. The proposed model is deployed\nin the risk management system of one of the world's largest e-commerce\nplatforms, which utilize it to provide real-time transaction fraud detection.\nExperimental results on real industrial data from different regions in the\nplatform clearly demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements\ncompared with various state-of-the-art baseline models.

Training very large\ntransformer models allowed significant improvement in both fields, but once\ntrained, these networks show symptoms of over-parameterization. For instance,\nit is known that many attention heads can be pruned without impacting accuracy.\nThis work aims to enhance current understanding on how multiple heads interact.\nMotivated by the observation that attention heads learn redundant key/query\nprojections, we propose a collaborative multi-head attention layer that enables\nheads to learn shared projections. Our scheme decreases the number of\nparameters in an attention layer and can be used as a drop-in replacement in\nany transformer architecture. Our experiments confirm that sharing key/query\ndimensions can be exploited in language understanding, machine translation and\nvision. We also show that it is possible to re-parametrize a pre-trained\nmulti-head attention layer into our collaborative attention layer.\nCollaborative multi-head attention reduces the size of the key and query\nprojections by 4 for same accuracy and speed.

          "description": "In recent years, deep neural networks have been successful in both industry\nand academia, especially for computer vision tasks. The great success of deep\nlearning is mainly due to its scalability to encode large-scale data and to\nmaneuver billions of model parameters. However, it is a challenge to deploy\nthese cumbersome deep models on devices with limited resources, e.g., mobile\nphones and embedded devices, not only because of the high computational\ncomplexity but also the large storage requirements. To this end, a variety of\nmodel compression and acceleration techniques have been developed. As a\nrepresentative type of model compression and acceleration, knowledge\ndistillation effectively learns a small student model from a large teacher\nmodel. It has received rapid increasing attention from the community. This\npaper provides a comprehensive survey of knowledge distillation from the\nperspectives of knowledge categories, training schemes, teacher-student\narchitecture, distillation algorithms, performance comparison and applications.\nFurthermore, challenges in knowledge distillation are briefly reviewed and\ncomments on future research are discussed and forwarded.",

Analog neuromorphic hardware uses the same principles to\nemulate spiking neural networks with exceptional energy-efficiency. However,\ninstantiating high-performing spiking networks on such hardware remains a\nsignificant challenge due to device mismatch and the lack of efficient training\nalgorithms. Here, we introduce a general in-the-loop learning framework based\non surrogate gradients that resolves these issues. Using the BrainScaleS-2\nneuromorphic system, we show that learning self-corrects for device mismatch\nresulting in competitive spiking network performance on both vision and speech\nbenchmarks. Our networks display sparse spiking activity with, on average, far\nless than one spike per hidden neuron and input, perform inference at rates of\nup to 85 k frames/second, and consume less than 200 mW. In summary, our work\nsets several new benchmarks for low-energy spiking network processing on analog\nneuromorphic hardware and paves the way for future on-chip learning algorithms.",

In this scenario, user's behavior evolves from single click\nbehavior to multiple behaviors including like, comment, share etc. However,\nmost of the existing methods still use single click behavior as the unique\ncriterion of judging user's preferences. Further, although heterogeneous graphs\nhave been applied in different areas, a proper way to construct a heterogeneous\ngraph for interactive news data with an appropriate learning mechanism on it is\nstill desired. To address the above concerns, we propose a graph-based\nbehavior-aware network, which simultaneously considers six different types of\nbehaviors as well as user's demand on the news diversity. We have three main\nsteps. First, we build an interaction behavior graph for multi-level and\nmulti-category data. Second, we apply DeepWalk on the behavior graph to obtain\nentity semantics, then build a graph-based convolutional neural network called\nG-CNN to learn news representations, and an attention-based LSTM to learn\nbehavior sequence representations. Third, we introduce core and coritivity\nfeatures for the behavior graph, which measure the concentration degree of\nuser's interests. These features affect the trade-off between accuracy and\ndiversity of our personalized recommendation system. Taking these features into\naccount, our system finally achieves recommending news to different users at\ntheir different levels of concentration degrees.",

Latent subgroups among the cities are uncovered through a\nclustering on the percentage of each road network category. In the subsequent\npart of the paper, we focus on the usability of such classification: the\neffectiveness of our human perception augmentation is examined by a case study\nof urban vitality prediction. An advanced tree-based regression model is for\nthe first time designated to establish the relationship between morphological\nindices and vitality indicators. A positive effect of human perception\naugmentation is detected in the comparative experiment of baseline model and\naugmented model. This work expands the toolkit of quantitative urban morphology\nstudy with new techniques, supporting further studies in the future.",

In this work, we build upon the deep support vector data\ndescription algorithm and address multi-perspective anomaly detection using\nthree different fusion techniques i.e. early fusion, late fusion, and late\nfusion with multiple decoders. We employ different augmentation techniques with\na denoising process to deal with scarce one-class data, which further improves\nthe performance (ROC AUC = 80\\%). Furthermore, we introduce the dices dataset\nthat consists of over 2000 grayscale images of falling dices from multiple\nperspectives, with 5\\% of the images containing rare anomalies (e.g. drill\nholes, sawing, or scratches). We evaluate our approach on the new dices dataset\nusing images from two different perspectives and also benchmark on the standard\nMNIST dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach\nexceeds the state-of-the-art on both the MNIST and dices datasets.

Besides, previous works\non fair recommendation mainly focus on association-based fairness. However, it\nis important to advance from associative fairness notions to causal fairness\nnotions for assessing fairness more properly in recommender systems.

          "description": "The novel corona virus (Covid-19) has introduced significant challenges due\nto its rapid spreading nature through respiratory transmission. As a result,\nthere is a huge demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based quick disease\ndiagnosis methods as an alternative to high demand tests such as Polymerase\nChain Reaction (PCR). Chest X-ray (CXR) Image analysis is such cost-effective\nradiography technique due to resource availability and quick screening. But, a\nsufficient and systematic data collection that is required by complex deep\nleaning (DL) models is more difficult and hence there are recent efforts that\nutilize transfer learning to address this issue. Still these transfer learnt\nmodels suffer from lack of generalization and increased bias to the training\ndataset resulting poor performance for unseen data. Limited correlation of the\ntransferred features from the pre-trained model to a specific medical imaging\ndomain like X-ray and overfitting on fewer data can be reasons for this\ncircumstance. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Convolution Neural Network\n(GCN) that is capable of identifying bio-markers of Covid-19 pneumonia from CXR\nimages and meta information about patients. The proposed method exploits\nimportant relational knowledge between data instances and their features using\ngraph representation and applies convolution to learn the graph data which is\nnot possible with conventional convolution on Euclidean domain. The results of\nextensive experiments of proposed model on binary (Covid vs normal) and three\nclass (Covid, normal, other pneumonia) classification problems outperform\ndifferent benchmark transfer learnt models, hence overcoming the aforementioned\ndrawbacks.",

We apply our topological score in three scenarios: i.\na U-net ii. a U-net pretrained on an autoencoder, and iii. a semisupervised\nU-net architecture, which offers a straightforward approach to jointly training\nthe network both as an autoencoder and a segmentation algorithm. This allows us\nto utilize un-annotated data for training a representation that generalizes\nacross test data variability, in spite of our annotated training data having\nvery limited variation.

          "description": "The Graph Augmented Multi-layer Perceptron (GA-MLP) model is an attractive\nalternative to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This is because it is resistant to\nthe over-smoothing problem, and deeper GA-MLP models yield better performance.\nGA-MLP models are traditionally optimized by the Stochastic Gradient Descent\n(SGD). However, SGD suffers from the layer dependency problem, which prevents\nthe gradients of different layers of GA-MLP models from being calculated in\nparallel. In this paper, we propose a parallel deep learning Alternating\nDirection Method of Multipliers (pdADMM) framework to achieve model\nparallelism: parameters in each layer of GA-MLP models can be updated in\nparallel. The extended pdADMM-Q algorithm reduces communication cost by\nutilizing the quantization technique. Theoretical convergence to a critical\npoint of the pdADMM algorithm and the pdADMM-Q algorithm is provided with a\nsublinear convergence rate $o(1/k)$. Extensive experiments in six benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that the pdADMM can lead to high speedup, and outperforms\nall the existing state-of-the-art comparison methods.",

          "description": "The absence or abnormality of fidgety movements of joints or limbs is\nstrongly indicative of cerebral palsy in infants. Developing computer-based\nmethods for assessing infant movements in videos is pivotal for improved\ncerebral palsy screening. Most existing methods use appearance-based features\nand are thus sensitive to strong but irrelevant signals caused by background\nclutter or a moving camera. Moreover, these features are computed over the\nwhole frame, thus they measure gross whole body movements rather than specific\njoint/limb motion.\n\nAddressing these challenges, we develop and validate a new method for fidgety\nmovement assessment from consumer-grade videos using human poses extracted from\nshort clips. Human poses capture only relevant motion profiles of joints and\nlimbs and are thus free from irrelevant appearance artifacts. The dynamics and\ncoordination between joints are modeled using spatio-temporal graph\nconvolutional networks. Frames and body parts that contain discriminative\ninformation about fidgety movements are selected through a spatio-temporal\nattention mechanism. We validate the proposed model on the cerebral palsy\nscreening task using a real-life consumer-grade video dataset collected at an\nAustralian hospital through the Cerebral Palsy Alliance, Australia. Our\nexperiments show that the proposed method achieves the ROC-AUC score of 81.87%,\nsignificantly outperforming existing competing methods with better\ninterpretability.",

          "description": "Smart home environments are designed to provide services that help improve\nthe quality of life for the occupant via a variety of sensors and actuators\ninstalled throughout the space. Many automated actions taken by a smart home\nare governed by the output of an underlying activity recognition system.\nHowever, activity recognition systems may not be perfectly accurate and\ntherefore inconsistencies in smart home operations can lead a user to wonder\n\"why did the smart home do that?\" In this work, we build on insights from\nExplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to contribute\ncomputational methods for explainable activity recognition. Specifically, we\ngenerate explanations for smart home activity recognition systems that explain\nwhat about an activity led to the given classification. To do so, we introduce\nfour computational techniques for generating natural language explanations of\nsmart home data and compare their effectiveness at generating meaningful\nexplanations. Through a study with everyday users, we evaluate user preferences\ntowards the four explanation types. Our results show that the leading approach,\nSHAP, has a 92% success rate in generating accurate explanations. Moreover, 84%\nof sampled scenarios users preferred natural language explanations over a\nsimple activity label, underscoring the need for explainable activity\nrecognition systems. Finally, we show that explanations generated by some XAI\nmethods can lead users to lose confidence in the accuracy of the underlying\nactivity recognition model, while others lead users to gain confidence. Taking\nall studied factors into consideration, we make a recommendation regarding\nwhich existing XAI method leads to the best performance in the domain of smart\nhome automation, and discuss a range of topics for future work in this area.",

As these APIs get deployed for high-stakes applications, it's very\nimportant that they are robust to different manipulations. Recent works have\nonly focused on typical adversarial attacks when evaluating the robustness of\nvision APIs. We propose two new aspects of adversarial image generation methods\nand evaluate them on the robustness of Google Cloud Vision API's optical\ncharacter recognition service and object detection APIs deployed in real-world\nsettings such as sightengine.com, picpurify.com, Google Cloud Vision API, and\nMicrosoft Azure's Computer Vision API.

These\nmethods are so straightforward that even non-specialists can craft such\nattacks. As a result, they pose a serious threat where APIs are used for\nhigh-stakes applications. Our transparent adversarial examples successfully\nevade state-of-the art object detections APIs such as Azure Cloud Vision\n(attack success rate 52%) and Google Cloud Vision (attack success rate 36%).\n90% of the images have a secret embedded text that successfully fools the\nvision of time-limited humans but is detected by Google Cloud Vision API's\noptical character recognition.

          "description": "In this paper, we consider the linear programming (LP) formulation for deep\nreinforcement learning. The number of the constraints depends on the size of\nstate and action spaces, which makes the problem intractable in large or\ncontinuous environments. The general augmented Lagrangian method suffers the\ndouble-sampling obstacle in solving the LP. Namely, the conditional\nexpectations originated from the constraint functions and the quadratic\npenalties in the augmented Lagrangian function impose difficulties in sampling\nand evaluation. Motivated from the updates of the multipliers, we overcome the\nobstacles in minimizing the augmented Lagrangian function by replacing the\nintractable conditional expectations with the multipliers. Therefore, a deep\nparameterized augment Lagrangian method is proposed. Furthermore, the\nreplacement provides a promising breakthrough to integrate the two steps in the\naugmented Lagrangian method into a single constrained problem. A general\ntheoretical analysis shows that the solutions generated from a sequence of the\nconstrained optimizations converge to the optimal solution of the LP if the\nerror is controlled properly. A theoretical analysis on the quadratic penalty\nalgorithm under neural tangent kernel setting shows the residual can be\narbitrarily small if the parameter in network and optimization algorithm is\nchosen suitably. Preliminary experiments illustrate that our method is\ncompetitive to other state-of-the-art algorithms.",

          "description": "A Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph that represents statistical\ndependencies between variables of a joint probability distribution. A\nfundamental task in data science is to learn a Bayesian network from observed\ndata. \\textsc{Polytree Learning} is the problem of learning an optimal Bayesian\nnetwork that fulfills the additional property that its underlying undirected\ngraph is a forest. In this work, we revisit the complexity of \\textsc{Polytree\nLearning}. We show that \\textsc{Polytree Learning} can be solved in $3^n \\cdot\n|I|^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$ time where $n$ is the number of variables and $|I|$ is\nthe total instance size. Moreover, we consider the influence of the number of\nvariables $d$ that might receive a nonempty parent set in the final DAG on the\ncomplexity of \\textsc{Polytree Learning}. We show that \\textsc{Polytree\nLearning} has no $f(d)\\cdot |I|^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$-time algorithm, unlike\nBayesian network learning which can be solved in $2^d \\cdot\n|I|^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$ time. We show that, in contrast, if $d$ and the maximum\nparent set size are bounded, then we can obtain efficient algorithms.",

We use 64 two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography\n(2D-STE) features and seven clinical features to predict whether one has CHD.\nMethods: We develop a machine learning approach that integrates a number of\npopular classification methods together by model stacking, and generalize the\ntraditional stacking method to a two-step stacking method to improve the\ndiagnostic performance. Results: By borrowing strengths from multiple\nclassification models through the proposed method, we improve the CHD\nclassification accuracy from around 70% to 87.7% on the testing set. The\nsensitivity of the proposed method is 0.903 and the specificity is 0.843, with\nan AUC of 0.904, which is significantly higher than those of the individual\nclassification models.

However,\nmany technologies such as Deep Learning and tools like Word Embeddings have\nstarted to be investigated only recently, and many challenges remain open when\nit comes to healthcare domain applications. To address these challenges, we\npropose the use of Deep Learning and Word Embeddings for identifying sixteen\nmorbidity types within textual descriptions of clinical records. For this\npurpose, we have used a Deep Learning model based on Bidirectional Long-Short\nTerm Memory (LSTM) layers which can exploit state-of-the-art vector\nrepresentations of data such as Word Embeddings. We have employed pre-trained\nWord Embeddings namely GloVe and Word2Vec, and our own Word Embeddings trained\non the target domain. Furthermore, we have compared the performances of the\ndeep learning approaches against the traditional tf-idf using Support Vector\nMachine and Multilayer perceptron (our baselines). From the obtained results it\nseems that the latter outperforms the combination of Deep Learning approaches\nusing any word embeddings.

          "description": "In recent years, abstractive text summarization with multimodal inputs has\nstarted drawing attention due to its ability to accumulate information from\ndifferent source modalities and generate a fluent textual summary. However,\nexisting methods use short videos as the visual modality and short summary as\nthe ground-truth, therefore, perform poorly on lengthy videos and long\nground-truth summary. Additionally, there exists no benchmark dataset to\ngeneralize this task on videos of varying lengths. In this paper, we introduce\nAVIATE, the first large-scale dataset for abstractive text summarization with\nvideos of diverse duration, compiled from presentations in well-known academic\nconferences like NDSS, ICML, NeurIPS, etc. We use the abstract of corresponding\nresearch papers as the reference summaries, which ensure adequate quality and\nuniformity of the ground-truth. We then propose {\\name}, a factorized\nmulti-modal Transformer based decoder-only language model, which inherently\ncaptures the intra-modal and inter-modal dynamics within various input\nmodalities for the text summarization task. {\\name} utilizes an increasing\nnumber of self-attentions to capture multimodality and performs significantly\nbetter than traditional encoder-decoder based networks. Extensive experiments\nillustrate that {\\name} achieves significant improvement over the baselines in\nboth qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the existing How2 dataset for\nshort videos and newly introduced AVIATE dataset for videos with diverse\nduration, beating the best baseline on the two datasets by $1.39$ and $2.74$\nROUGE-L points respectively.",

          "description": "Due to the importance of the lower bounding distances and the attractiveness\nof symbolic representations, the family of symbolic aggregate approximations\n(SAX) has been used extensively for encoding time series data. However, typical\nSAX-based methods rely on two restrictive assumptions; the Gaussian\ndistribution and equiprobable symbols. This paper proposes two novel\ndata-driven SAX-based symbolic representations, distinguished by their\ndiscretization steps. The first representation, oriented for general data\ncompaction and indexing scenarios, is based on the combination of kernel\ndensity estimation and Lloyd-Max quantization to minimize the information loss\nand mean squared error in the discretization step. The second method, oriented\nfor high-level mining tasks, employs the Mean-Shift clustering method and is\nshown to enhance anomaly detection in the lower-dimensional space. Besides, we\nverify on a theoretical basis a previously observed phenomenon of the intrinsic\nprocess that results in a lower than the expected variance of the intermediate\npiecewise aggregate approximation. This phenomenon causes an additional\ninformation loss but can be avoided with a simple modification. The proposed\nrepresentations possess all the attractive properties of the conventional SAX\nmethod. Furthermore, experimental evaluation on real-world datasets\ndemonstrates their superiority compared to the traditional SAX and an\nalternative data-driven SAX variant.",

In this work, we provide\nsome theoretical insight into the properties of QNNs by presenting and\nanalyzing a new form of invariance embedded in QNNs for both quantum binary\nclassification and quantum representation learning, which we term negational\nsymmetry. Given a quantum binary signal and its negational counterpart where a\nbitwise NOT operation is applied to each quantum bit of the binary signal, a\nQNN outputs the same logits. That is to say, QNNs cannot differentiate a\nquantum binary signal and its negational counterpart in a binary classification\ntask. We further empirically evaluate the negational symmetry of QNNs in binary\npattern classification tasks using Google's quantum computing framework. The\ntheoretical and experimental results suggest that negational symmetry is a\nfundamental property of QNNs, which is not shared by classical models. Our\nfindings also imply that negational symmetry is a double-edged sword in\npractical quantum applications.",

          "description": "We propose a new type of neural networks, Kronecker neural networks (KNNs),\nthat form a general framework for neural networks with adaptive activation\nfunctions. KNNs employ the Kronecker product, which provides an efficient way\nof constructing a very wide network while keeping the number of parameters low.\nOur theoretical analysis reveals that under suitable conditions, KNNs induce a\nfaster decay of the loss than that by the feed-forward networks. This is also\nempirically verified through a set of computational examples. Furthermore,\nunder certain technical assumptions, we establish global convergence of\ngradient descent for KNNs. As a specific case, we propose the Rowdy activation\nfunction that is designed to get rid of any saturation region by injecting\nsinusoidal fluctuations, which include trainable parameters. The proposed Rowdy\nactivation function can be employed in any neural network architecture like\nfeed-forward neural networks, Recurrent neural networks, Convolutional neural\nnetworks etc. The effectiveness of KNNs with Rowdy activation is demonstrated\nthrough various computational experiments including function approximation\nusing feed-forward neural networks, solution inference of partial differential\nequations using the physics-informed neural networks, and standard deep\nlearning benchmark problems using convolutional and fully-connected neural\nnetworks.",

          "description": "Predicting links in complex networks has been one of the essential topics\nwithin the realm of data mining and science discovery over the past few years.\nThis problem remains an attempt to identify future, deleted, and redundant\nlinks using the existing links in a graph. Local random walk is considered to\nbe one of the most well-known algorithms in the category of quasi-local\nmethods. It traverses the network using the traditional random walk with a\nlimited number of steps, randomly selecting one adjacent node in each step\namong the nodes which have equal importance. Then this method uses the\ntransition probability between node pairs to calculate the similarity between\nthem. However, in most datasets, this method is not able to perform accurately\nin scoring remarkably similar nodes. In the present article, an efficient\nmethod is proposed for improving local random walk by encouraging random walk\nto move, in every step, towards the node which has a stronger influence.\nTherefore, the next node is selected according to the influence of the source\nnode. To do so, using mutual information, the concept of the asymmetric mutual\ninfluence of nodes is presented. A comparison between the proposed method and\nother similarity-based methods (local, quasi-local, and global) has been\nperformed, and results have been reported for 11 real-world networks. It had a\nhigher prediction accuracy compared with other link prediction approaches.",

          "description": "Knowing the uncertainty in a prediction is critical when making expensive\ninvestment decisions and when patient safety is paramount, but machine learning\n(ML) models in drug discovery typically provide only a single best estimate and\nignore all sources of uncertainty. Predictions from these models may therefore\nbe over-confident, which can put patients at risk and waste resources when\ncompounds that are destined to fail are further developed. Probabilistic\npredictive models (PPMs) can incorporate uncertainty in both the data and\nmodel, and return a distribution of predicted values that represents the\nuncertainty in the prediction. PPMs not only let users know when predictions\nare uncertain, but the intuitive output from these models makes communicating\nrisk easier and decision making better. Many popular machine learning methods\nhave a PPM or Bayesian analogue, making PPMs easy to fit into current\nworkflows. We use toxicity prediction as a running example, but the same\nprinciples apply for all prediction models used in drug discovery. The\nconsequences of ignoring uncertainty and how PPMs account for uncertainty are\nalso described. We aim to make the discussion accessible to a broad\nnon-mathematical audience.

          "description": "In this work, an efficient physics-constrained deep learning model is\ndeveloped for solving multiphase flow in 3D heterogeneous porous media. The\nmodel fully leverages the spatial topology predictive capability of\nconvolutional neural networks, and is coupled with an efficient\ncontinuity-based smoother to predict flow responses that need spatial\ncontinuity. Furthermore, the transient regions are penalized to steer the\ntraining process such that the model can accurately capture flow in these\nregions. The model takes inputs including properties of porous media, fluid\nproperties and well controls, and predicts the temporal-spatial evolution of\nthe state variables (pressure and saturation). While maintaining the continuity\nof fluid flow, the 3D spatial domain is decomposed into 2D images for reducing\ntraining cost, and the decomposition results in an increased number of training\ndata samples and better training efficiency. Additionally, a surrogate model is\nseparately constructed as a postprocessor to calculate well flow rate based on\nthe predictions of state variables from the deep learning model. We use the\nexample of CO2 injection into saline aquifers, and apply the\nphysics-constrained deep learning model that is trained from physics-based\nsimulation data and emulates the physics process. The model performs prediction\nwith a speedup of ~1400 times compared to physics-based simulations, and the\naverage temporal errors of predicted pressure and saturation plumes are 0.27%\nand 0.099% respectively. Furthermore, water production rate is efficiently\npredicted by a surrogate model for well flow rate, with a mean error less than\n5%.

          "description": "Deep generative models of 3D shapes have received a great deal of research\ninterest. Yet, almost all of them generate discrete shape representations, such\nas voxels, point clouds, and polygon meshes. We present the first 3D generative\nmodel for a drastically different shape representation -- describing a shape as\na sequence of computer-aided design (CAD) operations. Unlike meshes and point\nclouds, CAD models encode the user creation process of 3D shapes, widely used\nin numerous industrial and engineering design tasks. However, the sequential\nand irregular structure of CAD operations poses significant challenges for\nexisting 3D generative models. Drawing an analogy between CAD operations and\nnatural language, we propose a CAD generative network based on the Transformer.\nWe demonstrate the performance of our model for both shape autoencoding and\nrandom shape generation. To train our network, we create a new CAD dataset\nconsisting of 179,133 models and their CAD construction sequences. We have made\nthis dataset publicly available to promote future research on this topic.",

          "description": "Superpixels are higher-order perceptual groups of pixels in an image, often\ncarrying much more information than raw pixels. There is an inherent relational\nstructure to the relationship among different superpixels of an image. This\nrelational information can convey some form of domain information about the\nimage, e.g. relationship between superpixels representing two eyes in a cat\nimage. Our interest in this paper is to construct computer vision models,\nspecifically those based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to incorporate these\nsuperpixels information. We propose a methodology to construct a hybrid model\nthat leverages (a) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to deal with spatial\ninformation in an image, and (b) Graph Neural Network (GNN) to deal with\nrelational superpixel information in the image. The proposed deep model is\nlearned using a generic hybrid loss function that we call a `hybrid' loss. We\nevaluate the predictive performance of our proposed hybrid vision model on four\npopular image classification datasets: MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.\nMoreover, we evaluate our method on three real-world classification tasks:\nCOVID-19 X-Ray Detection, LFW Face Recognition, and SOCOFing Fingerprint\nIdentification. The results demonstrate that the relational superpixel\ninformation provided via a GNN could improve the performance of standard\nCNN-based vision systems.",

          "description": "Non-stationary environments are challenging for reinforcement learning\nalgorithms. If the state transition and/or reward functions change based on\nlatent factors, the agent is effectively tasked with optimizing a behavior that\nmaximizes performance over a possibly infinite random sequence of Markov\nDecision Processes (MDPs), each of which drawn from some unknown distribution.\nWe call each such MDP a context. Most related works make strong assumptions\nsuch as knowledge about the distribution over contexts, the existence of\npre-training phases, or a priori knowledge about the number, sequence, or\nboundaries between contexts. We introduce an algorithm that efficiently learns\npolicies in non-stationary environments. It analyzes a possibly infinite stream\nof data and computes, in real-time, high-confidence change-point detection\nstatistics that reflect whether novel, specialized policies need to be created\nand deployed to tackle novel contexts, or whether previously-optimized ones\nmight be reused. We show that (i) this algorithm minimizes the delay until\nunforeseen changes to a context are detected, thereby allowing for rapid\nresponses; and (ii) it bounds the rate of false alarm, which is important in\norder to minimize regret. Our method constructs a mixture model composed of a\n(possibly infinite) ensemble of probabilistic dynamics predictors that model\nthe different modes of the distribution over underlying latent MDPs. We\nevaluate our algorithm on high-dimensional continuous reinforcement learning\nproblems and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art (model-free and\nmodel-based) RL algorithms, as well as state-of-the-art meta-learning methods\nspecially designed to deal with non-stationarity.",

In\nthis paper, we introduce the graph sanitation problem, to answer an orthogonal\nquestion. That is, given a mining task and an initial graph, what is the best\nway to improve the initially provided graph? By learning a better graph as part\nof the input of the mining model, it is expected to benefit graph mining in a\nvariety of settings, ranging from denoising, imputation to defense. We\nformulate the graph sanitation problem as a bilevel optimization problem, and\nfurther instantiate it by semi-supervised node classification, together with an\neffective solver named GaSoliNe. Extensive experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed method is (1) broadly applicable with respect to different\ngraph neural network models and flexible graph modification strategies, (2)\neffective in improving the node classification accuracy on both the original\nand contaminated graphs in various perturbation scenarios. In particular, it\nbrings up to 25% performance improvement over the existing robust graph neural\nnetwork methods.",

          "description": "Over the past decade, many approaches have been introduced for traffic speed\nprediction. However, providing fine-grained, accurate, time-efficient, and\nadaptive traffic speed prediction for a growing transportation network where\nthe size of the network keeps increasing and new traffic detectors are\nconstantly deployed has not been well studied. To address this issue, this\npaper presents DistTune based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the\nNelder-Mead method. Whenever encountering an unprocessed detector, DistTune\ndecides if it should customize an LSTM model for this detector by comparing the\ndetector with other processed detectors in terms of the normalized traffic\nspeed patterns they have observed. If similarity is found, DistTune directly\nshares an existing LSTM model with this detector to achieve time-efficient\nprocessing. Otherwise, DistTune customizes an LSTM model for the detector to\nachieve fine-grained prediction. To make DistTune even more time-efficient,\nDistTune performs on a cluster of computing nodes in parallel. To achieve\nadaptive traffic speed prediction, DistTune also provides LSTM re-customization\nfor detectors that suffer from unsatisfactory prediction accuracy due to for\ninstance traffic speed pattern change. Extensive experiments based on traffic\ndata collected from freeway I5-N in California are conducted to evaluate the\nperformance of DistTune.

          "description": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training among mutually\ndistrusting parties. Model updates, rather than training data, are concentrated\nand fused in a central aggregation server. A key security challenge in FL is\nthat an untrustworthy or compromised aggregation process might lead to\nunforeseeable information leakage. This challenge is especially acute due to\nrecently demonstrated attacks that have reconstructed large fractions of\ntraining data from ostensibly \"sanitized\" model updates.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce TRUDA, a new cross-silo FL system, employing a\ntrustworthy and decentralized aggregation architecture to break down\ninformation concentration with regard to a single aggregator. Based on the\nunique computational properties of model-fusion algorithms, all exchanged model\nupdates in TRUDA are disassembled at the parameter-granularity and re-stitched\nto random partitions designated for multiple TEE-protected aggregators. Thus,\neach aggregator only has a fragmentary and shuffled view of model updates and\nis oblivious to the model architecture.

We also provide theoretical analyses showing that the\nproposed weighted supervised contrastive loss is the lower bound of the mutual\ninformation of two samples from the same class and the weighted unsupervised\ncontrastive loss is the lower bound of the mutual information between the\nhidden representation of two views of the same sample.

In this paper, we discuss this trade-off\nbetween sensitivity and robustness to natural (non-adversarial) perturbations\nby introducing two notions: contextual feature utility and contextual feature\nsensitivity. We propose Feature Contrastive Learning (FCL) that encourages a\nmodel to be more sensitive to the features that have higher contextual utility.\nEmpirical results demonstrate that models trained with FCL achieve a better\nbalance of robustness and sensitivity, leading to improved generalization in\nthe presence of noise on both vision and NLP datasets.",

          "description": "This paper reviews a wide selection of machine learning models built to\npredict both the presence of diabetes and the presence of undiagnosed diabetes\nusing eight years of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\ndata. Models are tuned and compared via their Brier Scores. The most relevant\nvariables of the best performing models are then compared. A Support Vector\nMachine with a linear kernel performed best for predicting diabetes, returning\na Brier score of 0.0654 and an AUROC of 0.9235 on the test set. An elastic net\nregression performed best for predicting undiagnosed diabetes with a Brier\nscore of 0.0294 and an AUROC of 0.9439 on the test set. Similar features appear\nprominently in the models for both sets of models. Blood osmolality, family\nhistory, the prevalance of various compounds, and hypertension are key\nindicators for all diabetes risk. For undiagnosed diabetes in particular, there\nare ethnicity or genetic components which arise as strong correlates as well.",

          "description": "While imitation learning for vision based autonomous mobile robot navigation\nhas recently received a great deal of attention in the research community,\nexisting approaches typically require state action demonstrations that were\ngathered using the deployment platform. However, what if one cannot easily\noutfit their platform to record these demonstration signals or worse yet the\ndemonstrator does not have access to the platform at all? Is imitation learning\nfor vision based autonomous navigation even possible in such scenarios? In this\nwork, we hypothesize that the answer is yes and that recent ideas from the\nImitation from Observation (IfO) literature can be brought to bear such that a\nrobot can learn to navigate using only ego centric video collected by a\ndemonstrator, even in the presence of viewpoint mismatch. To this end, we\nintroduce a new algorithm, Visual Observation only Imitation Learning for\nAutonomous navigation (VOILA), that can successfully learn navigation policies\nfrom a single video demonstration collected from a physically different agent.\nWe evaluate VOILA in the photorealistic AirSim simulator and show that VOILA\nnot only successfully imitates the expert, but that it also learns navigation\npolicies that can generalize to novel environments. Further, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of VOILA in a real world setting by showing that it allows a\nwheeled Jackal robot to successfully imitate a human walking in an environment\nusing a video recorded using a mobile phone camera.",

          "description": "Despite the empirical success of neural architecture search (NAS) in deep\nlearning applications, the optimality, reproducibility and cost of NAS schemes\nremain hard to assess. In this paper, we propose Generative Adversarial NAS\n(GA-NAS) with theoretically provable convergence guarantees, promoting\nstability and reproducibility in neural architecture search. Inspired by\nimportance sampling, GA-NAS iteratively fits a generator to previously\ndiscovered top architectures, thus increasingly focusing on important parts of\na large search space. Furthermore, we propose an efficient adversarial learning\napproach, where the generator is trained by reinforcement learning based on\nrewards provided by a discriminator, thus being able to explore the search\nspace without evaluating a large number of architectures. Extensive experiments\nshow that GA-NAS beats the best published results under several cases on three\npublic NAS benchmarks. In the meantime, GA-NAS can handle ad-hoc search\nconstraints and search spaces. We show that GA-NAS can be used to improve\nalready optimized baselines found by other NAS methods, including EfficientNet\nand ProxylessNAS, in terms of ImageNet accuracy or the number of parameters, in\ntheir original search space.",

          "description": "Federated learning enables multiple users to build a joint model by sharing\ntheir model updates (gradients), while their raw data remains local on their\ndevices. In contrast to the common belief that this provides privacy benefits,\nwe here add to the very recent results on privacy risks when sharing gradients.\nSpecifically, we propose Label Leakage from Gradients (LLG), a novel attack to\nextract the labels of the users' training data from their shared gradients. The\nattack exploits the direction and magnitude of gradients to determine the\npresence or absence of any label. LLG is simple yet effective, capable of\nleaking potential sensitive information represented by labels, and scales well\nto arbitrary batch sizes and multiple classes. We empirically and\nmathematically demonstrate the validity of our attack under different settings.\nMoreover, empirical results show that LLG successfully extracts labels with\nhigh accuracy at the early stages of model training. We also discuss different\ndefense mechanisms against such leakage. Our findings suggest that gradient\ncompression is a practical technique to prevent our attack.",

          "description": "The joint task of bug localization and program repair is an integral part of\nthe software development process. In this work we present DeepDebug, an\napproach to automated debugging using large, pretrained transformers. We begin\nby training a bug-creation model on reversed commit data for the purpose of\ngenerating synthetic bugs. We apply these synthetic bugs toward two ends.\nFirst, we directly train a backtranslation model on all functions from 200K\nrepositories. Next, we focus on 10K repositories for which we can execute\ntests, and create buggy versions of all functions in those repositories that\nare covered by passing tests. This provides us with rich debugging information\nsuch as stack traces and print statements, which we use to finetune our model\nwhich was pretrained on raw source code. Finally, we strengthen all our models\nby expanding the context window beyond the buggy function itself, and adding a\nskeleton consisting of that function's parent class, imports, signatures,\ndocstrings, and method bodies, in order of priority. On the QuixBugs benchmark,\nwe increase the total number of fixes found by over 50%, while also decreasing\nthe false positive rate from 35% to 5% and decreasing the timeout from six\nhours to one minute. On our own benchmark of executable tests, our model fixes\n68% of all bugs on its first attempt without using traces, and after adding\ntraces it fixes 75% on first attempt. We will open-source our framework and\nvalidation set for evaluating on executable tests.",
