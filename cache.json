          "description": "Transformer has been widely adopted in Neural Machine Translation (NMT)\nbecause of its large capacity and parallel training of sequence generation.\nHowever, the deployment of Transformer is challenging because different\nscenarios require models of different complexities and scales. Naively training\nmultiple Transformers is redundant in terms of both computation and memory. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Scalable Transformers, which naturally contains\nsub-Transformers of different scales and have shared parameters. Each\nsub-Transformer can be easily obtained by cropping the parameters of the\nlargest Transformer. A three-stage training scheme is proposed to tackle the\ndifficulty of training the Scalable Transformers, which introduces additional\nsupervisions from word-level and sequence-level self-distillation. Extensive\nexperiments were conducted on WMT EN-De and En-Fr to validate our proposed\nScalable Transformers.",

          "description": "Hate speech and profanity detection suffer from data sparsity, especially for\nlanguages other than English, due to the subjective nature of the tasks and the\nresulting annotation incompatibility of existing corpora. In this study, we\nidentify profane subspaces in word and sentence representations and explore\ntheir generalization capability on a variety of similar and distant target\ntasks in a zero-shot setting.

          "description": "End-to-end speech translation models have become a new trend in research due\nto their potential of reducing error propagation. However, these models still\nsuffer from the challenge of data scarcity. How to effectively use unlabeled or\nother parallel corpora from machine translation is promising but still an open\nproblem. In this paper, we propose Cross Speech-Text Network (XSTNet), an\nend-to-end model for speech-to-text translation. XSTNet takes both speech and\ntext as input and outputs both transcription and translation text. The model\nbenefits from its three key design aspects: a self-supervised pre-trained\nsub-network as the audio encoder, a multi-task training objective to exploit\nadditional parallel bilingual text, and a progressive training procedure. We\nevaluate the performance of XSTNet and baselines on the MuST-C En-X and\nLibriSpeech En-Fr datasets. In particular, XSTNet achieves state-of-the-art\nresults on all language directions with an average BLEU of 28.8, outperforming\nthe previous best method by 3.2 BLEU.

          "description": "In this paper, we propose an open source, production first, and production\nready speech recognition toolkit called WeNet in which a new two-pass approach\nis implemented to unify streaming and non-streaming end-to-end (E2E) speech\nrecognition in a single model. The main motivation of WeNet is to close the gap\nbetween the research and the production of E2E speechrecognition models. WeNet\nprovides an efficient way to ship ASR applications in several real-world\nscenarios, which is the main difference and advantage to other open source E2E\nspeech recognition toolkits. In our toolkit, a new two-pass method is\nimplemented. Our method propose a dynamic chunk-based attention strategy of the\nthe transformer layers to allow arbitrary right context length modifies in\nhybrid CTC/attention architecture. The inference latency could be easily\ncontrolled by only changing the chunk size. The CTC hypotheses are then\nrescored by the attention decoder to get the final result. Our experiments on\nthe AISHELL-1 dataset using WeNet show that, our model achieves 5.03\\% relative\ncharacter error rate (CER) reduction in non-streaming ASR compared to a\nstandard non-streaming transformer. After model quantification, our model\nperform reasonable RTF and latency.",

          "description": "Query by Example is a well-known information retrieval task in which a\ndocument is chosen by the user as the search query and the goal is to retrieve\nrelevant documents from a large collection. However, a document often covers\nmultiple aspects of a topic. To address this scenario we introduce the task of\nfaceted Query by Example in which users can also specify a finer grained aspect\nin addition to the input query document. We focus on the application of this\ntask in scientific literature search. We envision models which are able to\nretrieve scientific papers analogous to a query scientific paper along\nspecifically chosen rhetorical structure elements as one solution to this\nproblem. In this work, the rhetorical structure elements, which we refer to as\nfacets, indicate backgrounds, methods, or results of a scientific paper. We\nintroduce and describe an expert annotated test collection to evaluate models\ntrained to perform this task. Our test collection consists of a diverse set of\n50 query documents, drawn from computational linguistics and machine learning\nvenues. We carefully followed the annotation guideline used by TREC for depth-k\npooling (k = 100 or 250) and the resulting data collection consists of graded\nrelevance scores with high annotation agreement. The data is freely available\nfor research purposes.",

          "description": "While current state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems\nachieve high accuracy on typical speech, they suffer from significant\nperformance degradation on disordered speech and other atypical speech\npatterns. Personalization of ASR models, a commonly applied solution to this\nproblem, is usually performed in a server-based training environment posing\nproblems around data privacy, delayed model-update times, and communication\ncost for copying data and models between mobile device and server\ninfrastructure. In this paper, we present an approach to on-device based ASR\npersonalization with very small amounts of speaker-specific data. We test our\napproach on a diverse set of 100 speakers with disordered speech and find\nmedian relative word error rate improvement of 71% with only 50 short\nutterances required per speaker. When tested on a voice-controlled home\nautomation platform, on-device personalized models show a median task success\nrate of 81%, compared to only 40% of the unadapted models.",

          "description": "Punctuation prediction for automatic speech recognition (ASR) output\ntranscripts plays a crucial role for improving the readability of the ASR\ntranscripts and for improving the performance of downstream natural language\nprocessing applications.

Experimental results on the English\nIWSLT2011 benchmark test set and an internal Chinese spoken language dataset\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvement on\npunctuation prediction accuracy over strong baselines including BERT, RoBERTa,\nand ELECTRA models. The proposed Discriminative Self-Training approach\noutperforms the vanilla self-training approach.

          "description": "In the traditional cascading architecture for spoken language understanding\n(SLU), it has been observed that automatic speech recognition errors could be\ndetrimental to the performance of natural language understanding. End-to-end\n(E2E) SLU models have been proposed to directly map speech input to desired\nsemantic frame with a single model, hence mitigating ASR error propagation.\nRecently, pre-training technologies have been explored for these E2E models. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel joint textual-phonetic pre-training approach for\nlearning spoken language representations, aiming at exploring the full\npotentials of phonetic information to improve SLU robustness to ASR errors. We\nexplore phoneme labels as high-level speech features, and design and compare\npre-training tasks based on conditional masked language model objectives and\ninter-sentence relation objectives. We also investigate the efficacy of\ncombining textual and phonetic information during fine-tuning. Experimental\nresults on spoken language understanding benchmarks, Fluent Speech Commands and\nSNIPS, show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms strong\nbaseline models and improves robustness of spoken language understanding to ASR\nerrors.",

          "description": "In recent years, great success has been achieved in the field of natural\nlanguage processing (NLP), thanks in part to the considerable amount of\nannotated resources. For named entity recognition (NER), most languages do not\nhave such an abundance of labeled data as English, so the performances of those\nlanguages are relatively lower. To improve the performance, we propose a\ngeneral approach called Back Attention Network (BAN). BAN uses a translation\nsystem to translate other language sentences into English and then applies a\nnew mechanism named back attention knowledge transfer to obtain task-specific\ninformation from pre-trained high-resource languages NER model. This strategy\ncan transfer high-layer features of well-trained model and enrich the semantic\nrepresentations of the original language. Experiments on three different\nlanguage datasets indicate that the proposed approach outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

We wish to combine the advantages\nof both types of models through an ensemble system to make more reliable\npredictions.

          "description": "In deep neural network modeling, the most common practice is to stack a\nnumber of recurrent, convolutional, or feed-forward layers in order to obtain\nhigh-quality continuous space representations which in turn improves the\nquality of the network's prediction. Conventionally, each layer in the stack\nhas its own parameters which leads to a significant increase in the number of\nmodel parameters. In this paper, we propose to share parameters across all\nlayers thereby leading to a recurrently stacked neural network model. We report\non an extensive case study on neural machine translation (NMT), where we apply\nour proposed method to an encoder-decoder based neural network model, i.e., the\nTransformer model, and experiment with three Japanese--English translation\ndatasets. We empirically demonstrate that the translation quality of a model\nthat recurrently stacks a single layer 6 times, despite having significantly\nfewer parameters, approaches that of a model that stacks 6 layers where each\nlayer has different parameters. We also explore the limits of recurrent\nstacking where we train extremely deep NMT models. This paper also examines the\nutility of our recurrently stacked model as a student model through transfer\nlearning via leveraging pre-trained parameters and knowledge distillation, and\nshows that it compensates for the performance drops in translation quality that\nthe direct training of recurrently stacked model brings. We also show how\ntransfer learning helps in faster decoding on top of the already reduced number\nof parameters due to recurrent stacking. Finally, we analyze the effects of\nrecurrently stacked layers by visualizing the attentions of models that use\nrecurrently stacked layers and models that do not.",

          "description": "Human creativity generates novel ideas to solve real-world problems. This\nthereby grants us the power to transform the surrounding world and extend our\nhuman attributes beyond what is currently possible. Creative ideas are not just\nnew and unexpected, but are also successful in providing solutions that are\nuseful, efficient and valuable. Thus, creativity optimizes the use of available\nresources and increases wealth. The origin of human creativity, however, is\npoorly understood, and semantic measures that could predict the success of\ngenerated ideas are currently unknown. Here, we analyze a dataset of design\nproblem-solving conversations in real-world settings by using 49 semantic\nmeasures based on WordNet 3.1 and demonstrate that a divergence of semantic\nsimilarity, an increased information content, and a decreased polysemy predict\nthe success of generated ideas. The first feedback from clients also enhances\ninformation content and leads to a divergence of successful ideas in creative\nproblem solving. These results advance cognitive science by identifying\nreal-world processes in human problem solving that are relevant to the success\nof produced solutions and provide tools for real-time monitoring of problem\nsolving, student training and skill acquisition. A selected subset of\ninformation content (IC S\\'anchez-Batet) and semantic similarity\n(Lin/S\\'anchez-Batet) measures, which are both statistically powerful and\ncomputationally fast, could support the development of technologies for\ncomputer-assisted enhancements of human creativity or for the implementation of\ncreativity in machines endowed with general artificial intelligence.",

In this approach, a representation is obtained via\nreduction to supervised learning, where given a notion of semantic similarity,\nthe learner tries to distinguish a similar (positive) example from a collection\nof random (negative) examples. The success of modern contrastive learning\npipelines relies on many parameters such as the choice of data augmentation,\nthe number of negative examples, and the batch size; however, there is limited\nunderstanding as to how these parameters interact and affect downstream\nperformance. We focus on disambiguating the role of one of these parameters:\nthe number of negative examples. Theoretically, we show the existence of a\ncollision-coverage trade-off suggesting that the optimal number of negative\nexamples should scale with the number of underlying concepts in the data.\nEmpirically, we scrutinize the role of the number of negatives in both NLP and\nvision tasks. In the NLP task, we find that the results broadly agree with our\ntheory, while our vision experiments are murkier with performance sometimes\neven being insensitive to the number of negatives.

          "description": "Joint extraction of entities and relations from unstructured texts is a\ncrucial task in information extraction. Recent methods achieve considerable\nperformance but still suffer from some inherent limitations, such as redundancy\nof relation prediction, poor generalization of span-based extraction and\ninefficiency. In this paper, we decompose this task into three subtasks,\nRelation Judgement, Entity Extraction and Subject-object Alignment from a novel\nperspective and then propose a joint relational triple extraction framework\nbased on Potential Relation and Global Correspondence (PRGC). Specifically, we\ndesign a component to predict potential relations, which constrains the\nfollowing entity extraction to the predicted relation subset rather than all\nrelations; then a relation-specific sequence tagging component is applied to\nhandle the overlapping problem between subjects and objects; finally, a global\ncorrespondence component is designed to align the subject and object into a\ntriple with low-complexity. Extensive experiments show that PRGC achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks with higher efficiency and\ndelivers consistent performance gain on complex scenarios of overlapping\ntriples.",

          "description": "Public concern detection provides potential guidance to the authorities for\ncrisis management before or during a pandemic outbreak. Detecting people's\nconcerns and attention from online social media platforms has been widely\nacknowledged as an effective approach to relieve public panic and prevent a\nsocial crisis. However, detecting concerns in time from massive information in\nsocial media turns out to be a big challenge, especially when sufficient\nmanually labeled data is in the absence of public health emergencies, e.g.,\nCOVID-19. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning model to\nidentify people's concerns and the corresponding relations based on Graph\nConvolutional Network and Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory integrated with\nConcern Graph. Except for the sequential features from BERT embeddings, the\nregional features of tweets can be extracted by the Concern Graph module, which\nnot only benefits the concern detection but also enables our model to be high\nnoise-tolerant. Thus, our model can address the issue of insufficient manually\nlabeled data. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed model\nby using both manually labeled tweets and automatically labeled tweets.

          "description": "Several years of research have shown that machine-learning systems are\nvulnerable to adversarial examples, both in theory and in practice. Until now,\nsuch attacks have primarily targeted visual models, exploiting the gap between\nhuman and machine perception. Although text-based models have also been\nattacked with adversarial examples, such attacks struggled to preserve semantic\nmeaning and indistinguishability. In this paper, we explore a large class of\nadversarial examples that can be used to attack text-based models in a\nblack-box setting without making any human-perceptible visual modification to\ninputs. We use encoding-specific perturbations that are imperceptible to the\nhuman eye to manipulate the outputs of a wide range of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) systems from neural machine-translation pipelines to web\nsearch engines. We find that with a single imperceptible encoding injection --\nrepresenting one invisible character, homoglyph, reordering, or deletion -- an\nattacker can significantly reduce the performance of vulnerable models, and\nwith three injections most models can be functionally broken. Our attacks work\nagainst currently-deployed commercial systems, including those produced by\nMicrosoft and Google, in addition to open source models published by Facebook\nand IBM. This novel series of attacks presents a significant threat to many\nlanguage processing systems: an attacker can affect systems in a targeted\nmanner without any assumptions about the underlying model. We conclude that\ntext-based NLP systems require careful input sanitization, just like\nconventional applications, and that given such systems are now being deployed\nrapidly at scale, the urgent attention of architects and operators is required.",

          "description": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models make fewer errors when more\nsurrounding speech information is presented as context. Unfortunately,\nacquiring a larger future context leads to higher latency. There exists an\ninevitable trade-off between speed and accuracy. Naively, to fit different\nlatency requirements, people have to store multiple models and pick the best\none under the constraints. Instead, a more desirable approach is to have a\nsingle model that can dynamically adjust its latency based on different\nconstraints, which we refer to as Multi-mode ASR. A Multi-mode ASR model can\nfulfill various latency requirements during inference -- when a larger latency\nbecomes acceptable, the model can process longer future context to achieve\nhigher accuracy and when a latency budget is not flexible, the model can be\nless dependent on future context but still achieve reliable accuracy. In\npursuit of Multi-mode ASR, we propose Stochastic Future Context, a simple\ntraining procedure that samples one streaming configuration in each iteration.\nThrough extensive experiments on AISHELL-1 and LibriSpeech datasets, we show\nthat a Multi-mode ASR model rivals, if not surpasses, a set of competitive\nstreaming baselines trained with different latency budgets.",

          "description": "Building a benchmark dataset for hate speech detection presents several\nchallenges. Firstly, because hate speech is relatively rare -- e.g., less than\n3\\% of Twitter posts are hateful \\citep{founta2018large} -- random sampling of\ntweets to annotate is inefficient in capturing hate speech. A common practice\nis to only annotate tweets containing known ``hate words'', but this risks\nyielding a biased benchmark that only partially captures the real-world\nphenomenon of interest. A second challenge is that definitions of hate speech\ntend to be highly variable and subjective. Annotators having diverse prior\nnotions of hate speech may not only disagree with one another but also struggle\nto conform to specified labeling guidelines. Our key insight is that the rarity\nand subjectivity of hate speech are akin to that of relevance in information\nretrieval (IR). This connection suggests that well-established methodologies\nfor creating IR test collections might also be usefully applied to create\nbetter benchmark datasets for hate speech detection. Firstly, to intelligently\nand efficiently select which tweets to annotate, we apply established IR\ntechniques of {\\em pooling} and {\\em active learning}. Secondly, to improve\nboth consistency and value of annotations, we apply {\\em task decomposition}\n\\cite{Zhang-sigir14} and {\\em annotator rationale} \\cite{mcdonnell16-hcomp}\ntechniques. Using the above techniques, we create and share a new benchmark\ndataset\\footnote{We will release the dataset upon publication.} for hate speech\ndetection with broader coverage than prior datasets. We also show a dramatic\ndrop in accuracy of existing detection models when tested on these broader\nforms of hate. Collected annotator rationales not only provide documented\nsupport for labeling decisions but also create exciting future work\nopportunities for dual-supervision and/or explanation generation in modeling.",

          "description": "In this paper, we identify an interesting kind of error in the output of\nUnsupervised Neural Machine Translation (UNMT) systems like\n\\textit{Undreamt}(footnote). We refer to this error type as \\textit{Scrambled\nTranslation problem}. We observe that UNMT models which use \\textit{word\nshuffle} noise (as in case of Undreamt) can generate correct words, but fail to\nstitch them together to form phrases. As a result, words of the translated\nsentence look \\textit{scrambled}, resulting in decreased BLEU. We hypothesise\nthat the reason behind \\textit{scrambled translation problem} is 'shuffling\nnoise' which is introduced in every input sentence as a denoising strategy. To\ntest our hypothesis, we experiment by retraining UNMT models with a simple\n\\textit{retraining} strategy. We stop the training of the Denoising UNMT model\nafter a pre-decided number of iterations and resume the training for the\nremaining iterations -- which number is also pre-decided -- using original\nsentence as input without adding any noise. Our proposed solution achieves\nsignificant performance improvement UNMT models that train conventionally. We\ndemonstrate these performance gains on four language pairs, \\textit{viz.},\nEnglish-French, English-German, English-Spanish, Hindi-Punjabi. Our qualitative\nand quantitative analysis shows that the retraining strategy helps achieve\nbetter alignment as observed by attention heatmap and better phrasal\ntranslation, leading to statistically significant improvement in BLEU scores.",

In this context, existing\nresearch has shown that patients often develop language impairment even in mild\nAD conditions. We propose a multimodal deep learning method that utilizes\nspeech and the corresponding transcript simultaneously to detect AD. For audio\nsignals, the proposed audio-based network, a convolutional neural network (CNN)\nbased model, predicts the diagnosis for multiple speech segments, which are\ncombined for the final prediction. Similarly, we use contextual embedding\nextracted from BERT concatenated with a CNN-generated embedding for classifying\nthe transcript. The individual predictions of the two models are then combined\nto make the final classification. We also perform experiments to analyze the\nmodel performance when Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) system generated\ntranscripts are used instead of manual transcription in the text-based model.\nThe proposed method achieves 85.3% 10-fold cross-validation accuracy when\ntrained and evaluated on the Dementiabank Pitt corpus.",

However, vocabulary coverage issues, differences\nin construction method and discrepancies in emotion framework and\nrepresentation result in a heterogeneous landscape of emotion detection\nresources, calling for a unified approach to utilising them. To combat this, we\npresent an extended emotion lexicon of 30,273 unique entries, which is a result\nof merging eight existing emotion lexica by means of a multi-view variational\nautoencoder (VAE). We showed that a VAE is a valid approach for combining\nlexica with different label spaces into a joint emotion label space with a\nchosen number of dimensions, and that these dimensions are still interpretable.\nWe tested the utility of the unified VAE lexicon by employing the lexicon\nvalues as features in an emotion detection model. We found that the VAE lexicon\noutperformed individual lexica, but contrary to our expectations, it did not\noutperform a naive concatenation of lexica, although it did contribute to the\nnaive concatenation when added as an extra lexicon.

Social media provides an opportunity to\nestimate emerging risks to vaccine acceptance by including geographical\nlocation and detailing vaccine-related concerns. Methods for classifying social\nmedia posts, such as vaccine-related tweets, use language models (LMs) trained\non general domain text. However, challenges to measuring vaccine sentiment at\nscale arise from the absence of tonal stress and gestural cues and may not\nalways have additional information about the user, e.g., past tweets or social\nconnections. Another challenge in LMs is the lack of commonsense knowledge that\nare apparent in users metadata, i.e., emoticons, positive and negative words\netc. In this study, to classify vaccine sentiment tweets with limited\ninformation, we present a novel end-to-end framework consisting of\ninterconnected components that use domain-specific LM trained on\nvaccine-related tweets and models commonsense knowledge into a bidirectional\ngated recurrent network (CK-BiGRU) with context-aware attention.

Then, we\nsuggest the main advantage of the multi-head attention is the training\nstability, since it has less number of layers than the single-head attention,\nwhen attending the same number of positions. For example, 24-layer 16-head\nTransformer (BERT-large) and 384-layer single-head Transformer has the same\ntotal attention head number and roughly the same model size, while the\nmulti-head one is significantly shallower.

We also propose a two-stage extract-then-generate baseline\nand show that there exists a large gap (19.9% in ROUGE-L) between\nstate-of-the-art models and human performance, suggesting that the data will\nsupport significant future work.",

          "description": "The dominant paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale\npre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or\ndomains. As we pre-train larger models, conventional fine-tuning, which\nretrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an\nexample, deploying many independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with\n175B parameters, is extremely expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or\nLoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank\ndecomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly\nreducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. For GPT-3,\nLoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the\ncomputation hardware requirement by 3 times compared to full fine-tuning. LoRA\nperforms on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on both GPT-3 and\nGPT-2, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput,\nand no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation\ninto rank-deficiency in language model adaptations, which sheds light on the\nefficacy of LoRA.

          "description": "The ability of semantic reasoning over the sentence pair is essential for\nmany natural language understanding tasks, e.g., natural language inference and\nmachine reading comprehension. A recent significant improvement in these tasks\ncomes from BERT. As reported, the next sentence prediction (NSP) in BERT, which\nlearns the contextual relationship between two sentences, is of great\nsignificance for downstream problems with sentence-pair input. Despite the\neffectiveness of NSP, we suggest that NSP still lacks the essential signal to\ndistinguish between entailment and shallow correlation. To remedy this, we\npropose to augment the NSP task to a 3-class categorization task, which\nincludes a category for previous sentence prediction (PSP). The involvement of\nPSP encourages the model to focus on the informative semantics to determine the\nsentence order, thereby improves the ability of semantic understanding. This\nsimple modification yields remarkable improvement against vanilla BERT. To\nfurther incorporate the document-level information, the scope of NSP and PSP is\nexpanded into a broader range, i.e., NSP and PSP also include close but\nnonsuccessive sentences, the noise of which is mitigated by the label-smoothing\ntechnique. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method. Our method consistently improves the\nperformance on the NLI and MRC benchmarks, including the challenging HANS\ndataset \\cite{hans}, suggesting that the document-level task is still promising\nfor the pre-training.",

Earlier works on attribute\nnormalization focused on fuzzy string matching (also referred as syntactic\nmatching in this paper). In this work, we first perform an extensive study of\nnine syntactic matching algorithms and establish that 'cosine' similarity leads\nto best results, showing 2.7% improvement over commonly used Jaccard index.\nNext, we argue that string similarity alone is not sufficient for attribute\nnormalization as many surface forms require going beyond syntactic matching\n(e.g. \"720p\" and \"HD\" are synonyms). While semantic techniques like\nunsupervised embeddings (e.g. word2vec/fastText) have shown good results in\nword similarity tasks, we observed that they perform poorly to distinguish\nbetween close canonical forms, as these close forms often occur in similar\ncontexts. We propose to learn token embeddings using a twin network with\ntriplet loss. We propose an embedding learning task leveraging raw attribute\nvalues and product titles to learn these embeddings in a self-supervised\nfashion. We show that providing supervision using our proposed task improves\nover both syntactic and unsupervised embeddings based techniques for attribute\nnormalization.

          "description": "Pre-trained language models induce dense entity representations that offer\nstrong performance on entity-centric NLP tasks, but such representations are\nnot immediately interpretable. This can be a barrier to model uptake in\nimportant domains such as biomedicine. There has been recent work on general\ninterpretable representation learning (Onoe and Durrett, 2020), but these\ndomain-agnostic representations do not readily transfer to the important domain\nof biomedicine. In this paper, we create a new entity type system and training\nset from a large corpus of biomedical texts by mapping entities to concepts in\na medical ontology, and from these to Wikipedia pages whose categories are our\ntypes. From this mapping we derive Biomedical Interpretable Entity\nRepresentations(BIERs), in which dimensions correspond to fine-grained entity\ntypes, and values are predicted probabilities that a given entity is of the\ncorresponding type. We propose a novel method that exploits BIER's final sparse\nand intermediate dense representations to facilitate model and entity type\ndebugging. We show that BIERs achieve strong performance in biomedical tasks\nincluding named entity disambiguation and entity label classification, and we\nprovide error analysis to highlight the utility of their interpretability,\nparticularly in low-supervision settings. Finally, we provide our induced 68K\nbiomedical type system, the corresponding 37 million triples of derived data\nused to train BIER models and our best performing model.",

          "description": "Natural language inference (NLI) is formulated as a unified framework for\nsolving various NLP problems such as relation extraction, question answering,\nsummarization, etc. It has been studied intensively in the past few years\nthanks to the availability of large-scale labeled datasets. However, most\nexisting studies focus on merely sentence-level inference, which limits the\nscope of NLI's application in downstream NLP problems. This work presents\nDocNLI -- a newly-constructed large-scale dataset for document-level NLI.\nDocNLI is transformed from a broad range of NLP problems and covers multiple\ngenres of text. The premises always stay in the document granularity, whereas\nthe hypotheses vary in length from single sentences to passages with hundreds\nof words. Additionally, DocNLI has pretty limited artifacts which unfortunately\nwidely exist in some popular sentence-level NLI datasets. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that, even without fine-tuning, a model pretrained on DocNLI shows\npromising performance on popular sentence-level benchmarks, and generalizes\nwell to out-of-domain NLP tasks that rely on inference at document granularity.\nTask-specific fine-tuning can bring further improvements.

Unfortunately, the\nlearning of DS-NER is severely dictionary-biased, which suffers from spurious\ncorrelations and therefore undermines the effectiveness and the robustness of\nthe learned models. In this paper, we fundamentally explain the dictionary bias\nvia a Structural Causal Model (SCM), categorize the bias into intra-dictionary\nand inter-dictionary biases, and identify their causes. Based on the SCM, we\nlearn de-biased DS-NER via causal interventions. For intra-dictionary bias, we\nconduct backdoor adjustment to remove the spurious correlations introduced by\nthe dictionary confounder. For inter-dictionary bias, we propose a causal\ninvariance regularizer which will make DS-NER models more robust to the\nperturbation of dictionaries.

          "description": "There is a recent trend in machine learning to increase model quality by\ngrowing models to sizes previously thought to be unreasonable. Recent work has\nshown that autoregressive generative models with cross-entropy objective\nfunctions exhibit smooth power-law relationships, or scaling laws, that predict\nmodel quality from model size, training set size, and the available compute\nbudget. These scaling laws allow one to choose nearly optimal hyper-parameters\ngiven constraints on available training data, model parameter count, or\ntraining computation budget. In this paper, we demonstrate that acoustic models\ntrained with an auto-predictive coding loss behave as if they are subject to\nsimilar scaling laws. We extend previous work to jointly predict loss due to\nmodel size, to training set size, and to the inherent \"irreducible loss\" of the\ntask. We find that the scaling laws accurately match model performance over two\norders of magnitude in both model size and training set size, and make\npredictions about the limits of model performance.",

An audio-to-intent (A2I) model\nencodes the intent of the utterance in the form of embeddings or posteriors,\nand these are used as auxiliary inputs for RNN-T training and inference.\nExperimenting with a 50k-hour far-field English speech corpus, this study shows\nthat when running the system in non-streaming mode, where intent representation\nis extracted from the entire utterance and then used to bias streaming RNN-T\nsearch from the start, it provides a 5.56% relative word error rate reduction\n(WERR). On the other hand, a streaming system using per-frame intent posteriors\nas extra inputs for the RNN-T ASR system yields a 3.33% relative WERR. A\nfurther detailed analysis of the streaming system indicates that our proposed\nmethod brings especially good gain on media-playing related intents (e.g. 9.12%\nrelative WERR on PlayMusicIntent).",

          "description": "Predicting chemical properties from the structure of a molecule is of great\nimportance in many applications including drug discovery and material design.\nMachine learning based molecular property prediction holds the promise of\nenabling accurate predictions at much less complexity, when compared to, for\nexample Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Features extracted from\nmolecular graphs, using graph neural nets in a supervised manner, have emerged\nas strong baselines for such tasks. However, the vast chemical space together\nwith the limited availability of labels makes supervised learning challenging,\ncalling for learning a general-purpose molecular representation. Recently,\npre-trained transformer-based language models (PTLMs) on large unlabeled corpus\nhave produced state-of-the-art results in many downstream natural language\nprocessing tasks. Inspired by this development, here we present molecular\nembeddings obtained by training an efficient transformer encoder model,\nreferred to as MoLFormer. This model was employed with a linear attention\nmechanism and highly paralleized training on 1D SMILES sequences of 1.1 billion\nunlabeled molecules from the PubChem and ZINC datasets. Experiments show that\nthe learned molecular representation performs competitively, when compared to\nexisting graph-based and fingerprint-based supervised learning baselines, on\nthe challenging tasks of predicting properties of QM8 and QM9 molecules.\nFurther task-specific fine-tuning of the MoLFormerr representation improves\nperformance on several of those property prediction benchmarks. These results\nprovide encouraging evidence that large-scale molecular language models can\ncapture sufficient structural information to be able to accurately predict\nquantum chemical properties and beyond.",

This\napproach alleviates the evaluation problem one normally has when converting\ntypical speech to pathological speech, as in our approach, the voice conversion\n(VC) model does not need to be optimised for speech degradation but only for\nthe speaker change. This change in the optimisation ensures that any\ndegradation found in naturalness is due to the conversion process and not due\nto the model exaggerating characteristics of a speech pathology. To show a\nproof of concept of this method, we convert dysarthric speech using the\nUASpeech database and an autoencoder-based VC technique. Subjective evaluation\nresults show reasonable naturalness for high intelligibility dysarthric\nspeakers, though lower intelligibility seems to introduce a marginal\ndegradation in naturalness scores for mid and low intelligibility speakers\ncompared to ground truth. Conversion of speaker characteristics for low and\nhigh intelligibility speakers is successful, but not for mid. Whether the\ndifferences in the results for the different intelligibility levels is due to\nthe intelligibility levels or due to the speakers needs to be further\ninvestigated.",

          "description": "Dialogue policy optimisation via reinforcement learning requires a large\nnumber of training interactions, which makes learning with real users time\nconsuming and expensive. Many set-ups therefore rely on a user simulator\ninstead of humans. These user simulators have their own problems. While\nhand-coded, rule-based user simulators have been shown to be sufficient in\nsmall, simple domains, for complex domains the number of rules quickly becomes\nintractable. State-of-the-art data-driven user simulators, on the other hand,\nare still domain-dependent. This means that adaptation to each new domain\nrequires redesigning and retraining. In this work, we propose a\ndomain-independent transformer-based user simulator (TUS). The structure of our\nTUS is not tied to a specific domain, enabling domain generalisation and\nlearning of cross-domain user behaviour from data. We compare TUS with the\nstate of the art using automatic as well as human evaluations.

The\ndataset consists of about 93 hours of transcribed audio recordings spoken by\ntwo professional speakers (female and male). It is the first publicly available\nlarge-scale dataset developed to promote Kazakh text-to-speech (TTS)\napplications in both academia and industry. In this paper, we share our\nexperience by describing the dataset development procedures and faced\nchallenges, and discuss important future directions. To demonstrate the\nreliability of our dataset, we built baseline end-to-end TTS models and\nevaluated them using the subjective mean opinion score (MOS) measure.\nEvaluation results show that the best TTS models trained on our dataset achieve\nMOS above 4 for both speakers, which makes them applicable for practical use.\nThe dataset, training recipe, and pretrained TTS models are freely available.",

We\npropose Mauve, a comparison measure for open-ended text generation, which\ndirectly compares a generation model's distribution to that of human-written\ntext. Mauve measures the mean area under a divergence curve for the two\ndistributions, exploring the trade-off between two types of errors: those\narising from parts of the human distribution that the model distribution\napproximates well, and those it does not. Mauve extends a family of information\ndivergence metrics, introducing a tractable approximation based on computing\nthe KL divergence in a quantized embedding space. This yields an efficient\nimplementation that scales up to modern text generation models. Through an\nextensive empirical study on three open-ended generation tasks, we find that\nMauve identifies known properties of generated text, scales naturally with\nmodel size, and correlates with human judgments, with fewer restrictions than\nexisting distributional evaluation metrics.",

          "description": "In recent years, automated approaches to assessing linguistic complexity in\nsecond language (L2) writing have made significant progress in gauging learner\nperformance, predicting human ratings of the quality of learner productions,\nand benchmarking L2 development. In contrast, there is comparatively little\nwork in the area of speaking, particularly with respect to fully automated\napproaches to assessing L2 spontaneous speech. While the importance of a\nwell-performing ASR system is widely recognized, little research has been\nconducted to investigate the impact of its performance on subsequent automatic\ntext analysis. In this paper, we focus on this issue and examine the impact of\nusing a state-of-the-art ASR system for subsequent automatic analysis of\nlinguistic complexity in spontaneously produced L2 speech. A set of 30 selected\nmeasures were considered, falling into four categories: syntactic, lexical,\nn-gram frequency, and information-theoretic measures. The agreement between the\nscores for these measures obtained on the basis of ASR-generated vs. manual\ntranscriptions was determined through correlation analysis. A more differential\neffect of ASR performance on specific types of complexity measures when\ncontrolling for task type effects is also presented.",

          "description": "Pre-trained language models have been successful on text classification\ntasks, but are prone to learning spurious correlations from biased datasets,\nand are thus vulnerable when making inferences in a new domain. Prior works\nreveal such spurious patterns via post-hoc explanation algorithms which compute\nthe importance of input features. Further, the model is regularized to align\nthe importance scores with human knowledge, so that the unintended model\nbehaviors are eliminated. However, such a regularization technique lacks\nflexibility and coverage, since only importance scores towards a pre-defined\nlist of features are adjusted, while more complex human knowledge such as\nfeature interaction and pattern generalization can hardly be incorporated. In\nthis work, we propose to refine a learned language model for a target domain by\ncollecting human-provided compositional explanations regarding observed biases.\nBy parsing these explanations into executable logic rules, the human-specified\nrefinement advice from a small set of explanations can be generalized to more\ntraining examples. We additionally introduce a regularization term allowing\nadjustments for both importance and interaction of features to better rectify\nmodel behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on\ntwo text classification tasks by showing improved performance in target domain\nas well as improved model fairness after refinement.",

          "description": "Variational autoencoders have been widely applied for natural language\ngeneration, however, there are two long-standing problems: information\nunder-representation and posterior collapse. The former arises from the fact\nthat only the last hidden state from the encoder is transformed to the latent\nspace, which is insufficient to summarize data. The latter comes as a result of\nthe imbalanced scale between the reconstruction loss and the KL divergence in\nthe objective function. To tackle these issues, in this paper we propose the\ndiscrete variational attention model with categorical distribution over the\nattention mechanism owing to the discrete nature in languages. Our approach is\ncombined with an auto-regressive prior to capture the sequential dependency\nfrom observations, which can enhance the latent space for language generation.\nMoreover, thanks to the property of discreteness, the training of our proposed\napproach does not suffer from posterior collapse. Furthermore, we carefully\nanalyze the superiority of discrete latent space over the continuous space with\nthe common Gaussian distribution. Extensive experiments on language generation\ndemonstrate superior advantages of our proposed approach in comparison with the\nstate-of-the-art counterparts.",

          "description": "Annotation projection is an important area in NLP that can greatly contribute\nto creating language resources for low-resource languages. Word alignment plays\na key role in this setting. However, most of the existing word alignment\nmethods are designed for a high resource setting in machine translation where\nmillions of parallel sentences are available. This amount reduces to a few\nthousands of sentences when dealing with low-resource languages failing the\nexisting established IBM models. In this paper, we propose subword\nsampling-based alignment of text units. This method's hypothesis is that the\naggregation of different granularities of text for certain language pairs can\nhelp word-level alignment. For certain languages for which gold-standard\nalignments exist, we propose an iterative Bayesian optimization framework to\noptimize selecting possible subwords from the space of possible subword\nrepresentations of the source and target sentences. We show that the subword\nsampling method consistently outperforms word-level alignment on six language\npairs: English-German, English-French, English-Romanian, English-Persian,\nEnglish-Hindi, and English-Inuktitut. In addition, we show that the\nhyperparameters learned for certain language pairs can be applied to other\nlanguages at no supervision and consistently improve the alignment results. We\nobserve that using $5K$ parallel sentences together with our proposed subword\nsampling approach, we obtain similar F1 scores to the use of $100K$'s of\nparallel sentences in existing word-level fast-align/eflomal alignment methods.",

          "description": "In recent years, the interest in Big Data sources has been steadily growing\nwithin the Official Statistic community. The Italian National Institute of\nStatistics (Istat) is currently carrying out several Big Data pilot studies.\nOne of these studies, the ICT Big Data pilot, aims at exploiting massive\namounts of textual data automatically scraped from the websites of Italian\nenterprises in order to predict a set of target variables (e.g. e-commerce)\nthat are routinely observed by the traditional ICT Survey. In this paper, we\nshow that Deep Learning techniques can successfully address this problem.\nEssentially, we tackle a text classification task: an algorithm must learn to\ninfer whether an Italian enterprise performs e-commerce from the textual\ncontent of its website. To reach this goal, we developed a sophisticated\nprocessing pipeline and evaluated its performance through extensive\nexperiments. Our pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks and relies on Word\nEmbeddings to encode raw texts into grayscale images (i.e. normalized numeric\nmatrices). Web-scraped texts are huge and have very low signal to noise ratio:\nto overcome these issues, we adopted a framework known as False Positive\nReduction, which has seldom (if ever) been applied before to text\nclassification tasks. Several original contributions enable our processing\npipeline to reach good classification results. Empirical evidence shows that\nour proposal outperforms all the alternative Machine Learning solutions already\ntested in Istat for the same task.",

          "description": "Video-grounded dialogue systems aim to integrate video understanding and\ndialogue understanding to generate responses that are relevant to both the\ndialogue and video context. Most existing approaches employ deep learning\nmodels and have achieved remarkable performance, given the relatively small\ndatasets available. However, the results are partly accomplished by exploiting\nbiases in the datasets rather than developing multimodal reasoning, resulting\nin limited generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of\nCompositional Counterfactual Contrastive Learning ($C^3$) to develop\ncontrastive training between factual and counterfactual samples in\nvideo-grounded dialogues. Specifically, we design factual/counterfactual\nsampling based on the temporal steps in videos and tokens in dialogues and\npropose contrastive loss functions that exploit object-level or action-level\nvariance. Different from prior approaches, we focus on contrastive hidden state\nrepresentations among compositional output tokens to optimize the\nrepresentation space in a generation setting. We achieved promising performance\ngains on the Audio-Visual Scene-Aware Dialogues (AVSD) benchmark and showed the\nbenefits of our approach in grounding video and dialogue context.",

When building such\ndifferent models, we can benefit from training them jointly to take advantage\nof the knowledge shared between them. Joint training is also efficient since it\nreduces the redundancy in the training procedure's data handling operations. We\npropose a method for collaboratively training acoustic encoders of different\nsizes for speech recognition. We use a sequence transducer setup where\ndifferent acoustic encoders share a common predictor and joiner modules. The\nacoustic encoders are also trained using co-distillation through an auxiliary\ntask for frame level chenone prediction, along with the transducer loss. We\nperform experiments using the LibriSpeech corpus and demonstrate that the\ncollaboratively trained acoustic encoders can provide up to a 11% relative\nimprovement in the word error rate on both the test partitions.",

          "description": "Recently developed large pre-trained language models, e.g., BERT, have\nachieved remarkable performance in many downstream natural language processing\napplications. These pre-trained language models often contain hundreds of\nmillions of parameters and suffer from high computation and latency in\nreal-world applications. It is desirable to reduce the computation overhead of\nthe models for fast training and inference while keeping the model performance\nin downstream applications. Several lines of work utilize knowledge\ndistillation to compress the teacher model to a smaller student model. However,\nthey usually discard the teacher's knowledge when in inference. Differently, in\nthis paper, we propose RefBERT to leverage the knowledge learned from the\nteacher, i.e., facilitating the pre-computed BERT representation on the\nreference sample and compressing BERT into a smaller student model. To\nguarantee our proposal, we provide theoretical justification on the loss\nfunction and the usage of reference samples. Significantly, the theoretical\nresult shows that including the pre-computed teacher's representations on the\nreference samples indeed increases the mutual information in learning the\nstudent model. Finally, we conduct the empirical evaluation and show that our\nRefBERT can beat the vanilla TinyBERT over 8.1\\% and achieves more than 94\\% of\nthe performance of $\\BERTBASE$ on the GLUE benchmark. Meanwhile, RefBERT is\n7.4x smaller and 9.5x faster on inference than BERT$_{\\rm BASE}$.",

Previous work in\nthis area has focused on targeted tasks in fixed domains, where the output\nsemantic structure is assumed a priori and the input speech is of limited\ncomplexity. In this work we present our approach to developing an E2E model for\ngeneralized SLU in commercial voice assistants (VAs). We propose a fully\ndifferentiable, transformer-based, hierarchical system that can be pretrained\nat both the ASR and NLU levels. This is then fine-tuned on both transcription\nand semantic classification losses to handle a diverse set of intent and\nargument combinations. This leads to an SLU system that achieves significant\nimprovements over baselines on a complex internal generalized VA dataset with a\n43% improvement in accuracy, while still meeting the 99% accuracy benchmark on\nthe popular Fluent Speech Commands dataset. We further evaluate our model on a\nhard test set, exclusively containing slot arguments unseen in training, and\ndemonstrate a nearly 20% improvement, showing the efficacy of our approach in\ntruly demanding VA scenarios.",

          "description": "Weak supervision has shown promising results in many natural language\nprocessing tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). Existing work mainly\nfocuses on learning deep NER models only with weak supervision, i.e., without\nany human annotation, and shows that by merely using weakly labeled data, one\ncan achieve good performance, though still underperforms fully supervised NER\nwith manually/strongly labeled data. In this paper, we consider a more\npractical scenario, where we have both a small amount of strongly labeled data\nand a large amount of weakly labeled data. Unfortunately, we observe that\nweakly labeled data does not necessarily improve, or even deteriorate the model\nperformance (due to the extensive noise in the weak labels) when we train deep\nNER models over a simple or weighted combination of the strongly labeled and\nweakly labeled data. To address this issue, we propose a new multi-stage\ncomputational framework -- NEEDLE with three essential ingredients: (1) weak\nlabel completion, (2) noise-aware loss function, and (3) final fine-tuning over\nthe strongly labeled data. Through experiments on E-commerce query NER and\nBiomedical NER, we demonstrate that NEEDLE can effectively suppress the noise\nof the weak labels and outperforms existing methods. In particular, we achieve\nnew SOTA F1-scores on 3 Biomedical NER datasets: BC5CDR-chem 93.74,\nBC5CDR-disease 90.69, NCBI-disease 92.28.",

          "description": "Language is an interface to the outside world. In order for embodied agents\nto use it, language must be grounded in other, sensorimotor modalities. While\nthere is an extended literature studying how machines can learn grounded\nlanguage, the topic of how to learn spatio-temporal linguistic concepts is\nstill largely uncharted. To make progress in this direction, we here introduce\na novel spatio-temporal language grounding task where the goal is to learn the\nmeaning of spatio-temporal descriptions of behavioral traces of an embodied\nagent. This is achieved by training a truth function that predicts if a\ndescription matches a given history of observations. The descriptions involve\ntime-extended predicates in past and present tense as well as spatio-temporal\nreferences to objects in the scene. To study the role of architectural biases\nin this task, we train several models including multimodal Transformer\narchitectures; the latter implement different attention computations between\nwords and objects across space and time. We test models on two classes of\ngeneralization: 1) generalization to randomly held-out sentences; 2)\ngeneralization to grammar primitives. We observe that maintaining object\nidentity in the attention computation of our Transformers is instrumental to\nachieving good performance on generalization overall, and that summarizing\nobject traces in a single token has little influence on performance. We then\ndiscuss how this opens new perspectives for language-guided autonomous embodied\nagents. We also release our code under open-source license as well as\npretrained models and datasets to encourage the wider community to build upon\nand extend our work in the future.",

We specifically consider whether incorporating attention into a\nconvolutional model is beneficial for localisation. Although absolute\nlocalisation performance with visually supervised models is still modest\n(compared to using unordered bag-of-word text labels for supervision), we show\nthat attention provides a large gain in performance over previous visually\ngrounded models.

The\ngreater expressiveness of the improved PW leads to better-perceived signal\nquality and naturalness in the waveform reconstruction and text-to-speech (TTS)\ntasks. We evaluate the model across different speaking styles on a\nmulti-speaker, multi-lingual dataset. In the waveform reconstruction task, the\nproposed model closes the naturalness and signal quality gap from the original\nPW to recordings by $10\\%$, and from other state-of-the-art neural vocoding\nsystems by more than $60\\%$. We also demonstrate improvements in objective\nmetrics on the evaluation test set with L2 Spectral Distance and Cross-Entropy\nreduced by $3\\%$ and $6\\unicode{x2030}$ comparing to the affine PW.\nFurthermore, we extend the probability density distillation procedure proposed\nby the original PW paper, so that it works with any non-affine invertible and\ndifferentiable function.",

Integration of BSR\noperations enables the TVM runtime execution to leverage structured pattern\nsparsity induced by model regularization.\n\nThis integrated view of pruning algorithms enables us to study relationships\nbetween modeling decisions and their direct impact on sparsity-enhanced\nexecution. Our main findings are: 1) we validate that performance benefits of\nstructured sparsity block regularization must be enabled by the BSR\naugmentations to TVM, with 4x speedup relative to vanilla PyTorch and 2.2x\nspeedup relative to standard TVM compilation (without expanded BSR support). 2)\nfor BERT attention weights, the end-to-end optimal block sparsity shape in this\nCPU inference context is not a square block (as in \\cite{gray2017gpu}) but\nrather a linear 32x1 block 3) the relationship between performance and block\nsize / shape is is suggestive of how model regularization parameters interact\nwith task scheduler optimizations resulting in the observed end-to-end\nperformance.",

We show an average\nimprovement of 35% in intent detection and 21% in slot tagging over a baseline\nmodel trained from the seed data. We also conduct an analysis of the novelty of\nthe generated data and provide generated examples for intent detection, slot\ntagging, and non-goal oriented conversations.",

          "description": "Out-of-scope intent detection is of practical importance in task-oriented\ndialogue systems. Since the distribution of outlier utterances is arbitrary and\nunknown in the training stage, existing methods commonly rely on strong\nassumptions on data distribution such as mixture of Gaussians to make\ninference, resulting in either complex multi-step training procedures or\nhand-crafted rules such as confidence threshold selection for outlier\ndetection. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to train an\nout-of-scope intent classifier in a fully end-to-end manner by simulating the\ntest scenario in training, which requires no assumption on data distribution\nand no additional post-processing or threshold setting. Specifically, we\nconstruct a set of pseudo outliers in the training stage, by generating\nsynthetic outliers using inliner features via self-supervision and sampling\nout-of-scope sentences from easily available open-domain datasets. The pseudo\noutliers are used to train a discriminative classifier that can be directly\napplied to and generalize well on the test task. We evaluate our method\nextensively on four benchmark dialogue datasets and observe significant\nimprovements over state-of-the-art approaches.

In this paper, we\nask: does the distance in the acoustic embedding space correlate with\nphonological dissimilarity? To answer this question, we empirically investigate\nthe performance of supervised approaches for AWEs with different neural\narchitectures and learning objectives. We train AWE models in controlled\nsettings for two languages (German and Czech) and evaluate the embeddings on\ntwo tasks: word discrimination and phonological similarity. Our experiments\nshow that (1) the distance in the embedding space in the best cases only\nmoderately correlates with phonological distance, and (2) improving the\nperformance on the word discrimination task does not necessarily yield models\nthat better reflect word phonological similarity.

The state of the art for semantic representation and\ninference is deep learning, and particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and transformer Self-Attention models.\nThis thesis investigates the use of deep learning for novel semantic\nrepresentation and inference, and makes contributions in the following three\nareas: creating training data, improving semantic representations and extending\ninference learning. In terms of creating training data, we contribute the\nlargest publicly available dataset of real-life factual claims for the purpose\nof automatic claim verification (MultiFC), and we present a novel inference\nmodel composed of multi-scale CNNs with different kernel sizes that learn from\nexternal sources to infer fact checking labels. In terms of improving semantic\nrepresentations, we contribute a novel model that captures non-compositional\nsemantic indicators. By definition, the meaning of a non-compositional phrase\ncannot be inferred from the individual meanings of its composing words (e.g.,\nhot dog). Motivated by this, we operationalize the compositionality of a phrase\ncontextually by enriching the phrase representation with external word\nembeddings and knowledge graphs. Finally, in terms of inference learning, we\npropose a series of novel deep learning architectures that improve inference by\nusing syntactic dependencies, by ensembling role guided attention heads,\nincorporating gating layers, and concatenating multiple heads in novel and\neffective ways.

          "description": "As speech-enabled devices such as smartphones and smart speakers become\nincreasingly ubiquitous, there is growing interest in building automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) systems that can run directly on-device; end-to-end (E2E)\nspeech recognition models such as recurrent neural network transducers and\ntheir variants have recently emerged as prime candidates for this task. Apart\nfrom being accurate and compact, such systems need to decode speech with low\nuser-perceived latency (UPL), producing words as soon as they are spoken. This\nwork examines the impact of various techniques - model architectures, training\ncriteria, decoding hyperparameters, and endpointer parameters - on UPL. Our\nanalyses suggest that measures of model size (parameters, input chunk sizes),\nor measures of computation (e.g., FLOPS, RTF) that reflect the model's ability\nto process input frames are not always strongly correlated with observed UPL.\nThus, conventional algorithmic latency measurements might be inadequate in\naccurately capturing latency observed when models are deployed on embedded\ndevices. Instead, we find that factors affecting token emission latency, and\nendpointing behavior have a larger impact on UPL. We achieve the best trade-off\nbetween latency and word error rate when performing ASR jointly with\nendpointing, while utilizing the recently proposed alignment regularization\nmechanism.",

          "description": "In recent years, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has achieved notable\nresults in various translation tasks. However, the word-by-word generation\nmanner determined by the autoregressive mechanism leads to high translation\nlatency of the NMT and restricts its low-latency applications.\nNon-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation (NAT) removes the autoregressive\nmechanism and achieves significant decoding speedup through generating target\nwords independently and simultaneously. Nevertheless, NAT still takes the\nword-level cross-entropy loss as the training objective, which is not optimal\nbecause the output of NAT cannot be properly evaluated due to the multimodality\nproblem. In this paper, we propose using sequence-level training objectives to\ntrain NAT models, which evaluate the NAT outputs as a whole and correlates well\nwith the real translation quality. Firstly, we propose training NAT models to\noptimize sequence-level evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU) based on several novel\nreinforcement algorithms customized for NAT, which outperforms the conventional\nmethod by reducing the variance of gradient estimation. Secondly, we introduce\na novel training objective for NAT models, which aims to minimize the\nBag-of-Ngrams (BoN) difference between the model output and the reference\nsentence. The BoN training objective is differentiable and can be calculated\nefficiently without doing any approximations. Finally, we apply a three-stage\ntraining strategy to combine these two methods to train the NAT model. We\nvalidate our approach on four translation tasks (WMT14 En$\\leftrightarrow$De,\nWMT16 En$\\leftrightarrow$Ro), which shows that our approach largely outperforms\nNAT baselines and achieves remarkable performance on all translation tasks.",

          "description": "In structured prediction, a major challenge for models is to represent the\ninterdependencies within their output structures. For the common case where\noutputs are structured as a sequence, linear-chain conditional random fields\n(CRFs) are a widely used model class which can learn local dependencies in\noutput sequences. However, the CRF's Markov assumption makes it impossible for\nthese models to capture nonlocal dependencies, and standard CRFs are unable to\nrespect nonlocal constraints of the data (such as global arity constraints on\noutput labels). We present a generalization of CRFs that can enforce a broad\nclass of constraints, including nonlocal ones, by specifying the space of\npossible output structures as a regular language $\\mathcal{L}$. The resulting\nregular-constrained CRF (RegCCRF) has the same formal properties as a standard\nCRF, but assigns zero probability to all label sequences not in $\\mathcal{L}$.\nNotably, RegCCRFs can incorporate their constraints during training, while\nrelated models only enforce constraints during decoding. We prove that\nconstrained training is never worse than constrained decoding, and show using\nsynthetic data that it can be substantially better in practice. Additionally,\nwe demonstrate a practical benefit on downstream tasks by incorporating a\nRegCCRF into a deep neural model for semantic role labeling, exceeding\nstate-of-the-art results on a standard dataset.",

          "description": "In this paper, we present a multi-lingual sentence encoder that can be used\nin search engines as a query and document encoder. This embedding enables a\nsemantic similarity score between queries and documents that can be an\nimportant feature in document ranking and relevancy. To train such a customized\nsentence encoder, it is beneficial to leverage users search data in the form of\nquery-document clicked pairs however, we must avoid relying too much on search\nclick data as it is biased and does not cover many unseen cases. The search\ndata is heavily skewed towards short queries and for long queries is small and\noften noisy. The goal is to design a universal multi-lingual encoder that works\nfor all cases and covers both short and long queries. We select a number of\npublic NLI datasets in different languages and translation data and together\nwith user search data we train a language model using a multi-task approach. A\nchallenge is that these datasets are not homogeneous in terms of content, size\nand the balance ratio. While the public NLI datasets are usually two-sentence\nbased with the same portion of positive and negative pairs, the user search\ndata can contain multi-sentence documents and only positive pairs. We show how\nmulti-task training enables us to leverage all these datasets and exploit\nknowledge sharing across these tasks.",

          "description": "The amount of archaeological literature is growing rapidly. Until recently,\nthese data were only accessible through metadata search. We implemented a text\nretrieval engine for a large archaeological text collection ($\\sim 658$ Million\nwords). In archaeological IR, domain-specific entities such as locations, time\nperiods, and artefacts, play a central role. This motivated the development of\na named entity recognition (NER) model to annotate the full collection with\narchaeological named entities. In this paper, we present ArcheoBERTje, a BERT\nmodel pre-trained on Dutch archaeological texts. We compare the model's quality\nand output on a Named Entity Recognition task to a generic multilingual model\nand a generic Dutch model. We also investigate ensemble methods for combining\nmultiple BERT models, and combining the best BERT model with a domain thesaurus\nusing Conditional Random Fields (CRF). We find that ArcheoBERTje outperforms\nboth the multilingual and Dutch model significantly with a smaller standard\ndeviation between runs, reaching an average F1 score of 0.735. The model also\noutperforms ensemble methods combining the three models. Combining ArcheoBERTje\npredictions and explicit domain knowledge from the thesaurus did not increase\nthe F1 score. We quantitatively and qualitatively analyse the differences\nbetween the vocabulary and output of the BERT models on the full collection and\nprovide some valuable insights in the effect of fine-tuning for specific\ndomains. Our results indicate that for a highly specific text domain such as\narchaeology, further pre-training on domain-specific data increases the model's\nquality on NER by a much larger margin than shown for other domains in the\nliterature, and that domain-specific pre-training makes the addition of domain\nknowledge from a thesaurus unnecessary.",

          "description": "Encoder pre-training is promising in end-to-end Speech Translation (ST),\ngiven the fact that speech-to-translation data is scarce. But ST encoders are\nnot simple instances of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Machine\nTranslation (MT) encoders. For example, we find that ASR encoders lack the\nglobal context representation, which is necessary for translation, whereas MT\nencoders are not designed to deal with long but locally attentive acoustic\nsequences. In this work, we propose a Stacked Acoustic-and-Textual Encoding\n(SATE) method for speech translation. Our encoder begins with processing the\nacoustic sequence as usual, but later behaves more like an MT encoder for a\nglobal representation of the input sequence. In this way, it is straightforward\nto incorporate the pre-trained models into the system. Also, we develop an\nadaptor module to alleviate the representation inconsistency between the\npre-trained ASR encoder and MT encoder, and develop a multi-teacher knowledge\ndistillation method to preserve the pre-training knowledge. Experimental\nresults on the LibriSpeech En-Fr and MuST-C En-De ST tasks show that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art BLEU scores of 18.3 and 25.2.

The\nalgorithm can naturally be viewed as a subset optimization problem, albeit one\nwhere the corresponding set function does not reflect interactions between\ncandidates. Empirically, this leads to sets often exhibiting high overlap,\ne.g., strings may differ by only a single word. Yet in use-cases that call for\nmultiple solutions, a diverse or representative set is often desired. To\naddress this issue, we propose a reformulation of beam search, which we call\ndeterminantal beam search. Determinantal beam search has a natural relationship\nto determinantal point processes (DPPs), models over sets that inherently\nencode intra-set interactions. By posing iterations in beam search as a series\nof subdeterminant maximization problems, we can turn the algorithm into a\ndiverse subset selection process. In a case study, we use the string\nsubsequence kernel to explicitly encourage n-gram coverage in text generated\nfrom a sequence model.

          "description": "One of the long-standing challenges in lexical semantics consists in learning\nrepresentations of words which reflect their semantic properties. The\nremarkable success of word embeddings for this purpose suggests that\nhigh-quality representations can be obtained by summarizing the sentence\ncontexts of word mentions. In this paper, we propose a method for learning word\nrepresentations that follows this basic strategy, but differs from standard\nword embeddings in two important ways. First, we take advantage of\ncontextualized language models (CLMs) rather than bags of word vectors to\nencode contexts. Second, rather than learning a word vector directly, we use a\ntopic model to partition the contexts in which words appear, and then learn\ndifferent topic-specific vectors for each word. Finally, we use a task-specific\nsupervision signal to make a soft selection of the resulting vectors. We show\nthat this simple strategy leads to high-quality word vectors, which are more\npredictive of semantic properties than word embeddings and existing CLM-based\nstrategies.",

          "description": "The activations of language transformers like GPT-2 have been shown to\nlinearly map onto brain activity during speech comprehension. However, the\nnature of these activations remains largely unknown and presumably conflate\ndistinct linguistic classes. Here, we propose a taxonomy to factorize the\nhigh-dimensional activations of language models into four combinatorial\nclasses: lexical, compositional, syntactic, and semantic representations. We\nthen introduce a statistical method to decompose, through the lens of GPT-2's\nactivations, the brain activity of 345 subjects recorded with functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the listening of ~4.6 hours of\nnarrated text. The results highlight two findings. First, compositional\nrepresentations recruit a more widespread cortical network than lexical ones,\nand encompass the bilateral temporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices. Second,\ncontrary to previous claims, syntax and semantics are not associated with\nseparated modules, but, instead, appear to share a common and distributed\nneural substrate. Overall, this study introduces a versatile framework to\nisolate, in the brain activity, the distributed representations of linguistic\nconstructs.",

In this work, we observe this\nlimitation with respect to the task of native language identification. We find\nthat standard text classifiers which perform well on the test set end up\nlearning topical features which are confounds of the prediction task (e.g., if\nthe input text mentions Sweden, the classifier predicts that the author's\nnative language is Swedish). We propose a method that represents the latent\ntopical confounds and a model which \"unlearns\" confounding features by\npredicting both the label of the input text and the confound; but we train the\ntwo predictors adversarially in an alternating fashion to learn a text\nrepresentation that predicts the correct label but is less prone to using\ninformation about the confound.

In this paper, we prove that\ntemperature scaling, a popular technique for post-hoc calibration of neural\nnetworks, cannot change the output of the aforementioned procedure. We conclude\nthat other techniques are needed to tackle miscalibration in graph-based\ndependency parsers in a way that improves parsing accuracy.",

However, due to the long session lengths and limited\nmodeling resources, computational methods largely rely on frequency-based\nlexical features or distribution of dialogue acts. In this work, we propose a\nhierarchical framework to automatically evaluate the quality of a CBT\ninteraction. We divide each psychotherapy session into conversation segments\nand input those into a BERT-based model to produce segment embeddings. We first\nfine-tune BERT for predicting segment-level (local) quality scores and then use\nsegment embeddings as lower-level input to a Bidirectional LSTM-based neural\nnetwork to predict session-level (global) quality estimates. In particular, the\nsegment-level quality scores are initialized with the session-level scores and\nwe model the global quality as a function of the local quality scores to\nachieve the accurate segment-level quality estimates. These estimated\nsegment-level scores benefit theBERT fine-tuning and in learning better segment\nembeddings. We evaluate the proposed framework on data drawn from real-world\nCBT clinical session recordings to predict multiple session-level behavior\ncodes.

We apply the adversarial paradigm to\nthis question, and introduce a new adversarial method of dataset creation for\nparaphrase identification: the Adversarial Paraphrasing Task (APT), which asks\nparticipants to generate semantically equivalent (in the sense of mutually\nimplicative) but lexically and syntactically disparate paraphrases.

In\nthis paper, we propose a mathematical framework for passing from probability\ndistributions on extensions of given texts to an enriched category containing\nsemantic information. Roughly speaking, we model probability distributions on\ntexts as a category enriched over the unit interval. Objects of this category\nare expressions in language and hom objects are conditional probabilities that\none expression is an extension of another. This category is syntactical: it\ndescribes what goes with what. We then pass to the enriched category of unit\ninterval-valued copresheaves on this syntactical category to find semantic\ninformation.",

We show that\nthe transducer's encoder outputs naturally have a high entropy and contain rich\ninformation about acoustically similar word-piece confusions. This rich\ninformation is suppressed when combined with the lower entropy decoder outputs\nto produce the joint network logits. Consequently, we introduce an auxiliary\nloss to distill the encoder logits from a teacher transducer's encoder, and\nexplore training strategies where this encoder distillation works effectively.\nWe find that tandem training of teacher and student encoders with an inplace\nencoder distillation outperforms the use of a pre-trained and static teacher\ntransducer. We also report an interesting phenomenon we refer to as implicit\ndistillation, that occurs when the teacher and student encoders share the same\ndecoder.

Current researches in this field mainly focus on\ngenerating responses consistent with the robot's pre-assigned persona, while\nignoring the user's persona. Such responses may be inappropriate or even\noffensive, which may lead to the bad user experience. Therefore, we propose a\nbilateral personalized dialogue generation (BPDG) method with dynamic\npersona-aware fusion via multi-task transfer learning to generate responses\nconsistent with both personas. The proposed method aims to accomplish three\nlearning tasks: 1) an encoder is trained with dialogue utterances added with\ncorresponded personalized attributes and relative position (language model\ntask), 2) a dynamic persona-aware fusion module predicts the persona presence\nto adaptively fuse the contextual and bilateral personas encodings (persona\nprediction task) and 3) a decoder generates natural, fluent and personalized\nresponses (dialogue generation task). To make the generated responses more\npersonalized and bilateral persona-consistent, the Conditional Mutual\nInformation Maximum (CMIM) criterion is adopted to select the final response\nfrom the generated candidates.

Yet current artificial negotiation agents often heavily depend\non the quality of the static datasets they were trained on, limiting their\ncapacity to fashion an adaptive response balancing self-interest and\ncooperation. For this reason, we find that these agents can achieve either high\nutility or cooperation, but not both. To address this, we introduce a targeted\ndata acquisition framework where we guide the exploration of a reinforcement\nlearning agent using annotations from an expert oracle. The guided exploration\nincentivizes the learning agent to go beyond its static dataset and develop new\nnegotiation strategies. We show that this enables our agents to obtain\nhigher-reward and more Pareto-optimal solutions when negotiating with both\nsimulated and human partners compared to standard supervised learning and\nreinforcement learning methods. This trend additionally holds when comparing\nagents using our targeted data acquisition framework to variants of agents\ntrained with a mix of supervised learning and reinforcement learning, or to\nagents using tailored reward functions that explicitly optimize for utility and\nPareto-optimality.",

This paradigm relies on direct supervision examples,\nwhich is not applicable to many applications, such as generating adversarial\nattacks or generating prompts to control language models. Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) on the other hand offers a more flexible solution by allowing\nusers to plug in arbitrary task metrics as reward. Yet previous RL algorithms\nfor text generation, such as policy gradient (on-policy RL) and Q-learning\n(off-policy RL), are often notoriously inefficient or unstable to train due to\nthe large sequence space and the sparse reward received only at the end of\nsequences. In this paper, we introduce a new RL formulation for text generation\nfrom the soft Q-learning perspective. It further enables us to draw from the\nlatest RL advances, such as path consistency learning, to combine the best of\non-/off-policy updates, and learn effectively from sparse reward. We apply the\napproach to a wide range of tasks, including learning from noisy/negative\nexamples, adversarial attacks, and prompt generation. Experiments show our\napproach consistently outperforms both task-specialized algorithms and the\nprevious RL methods. On standard supervised tasks where MLE prevails, our\napproach also achieves competitive performance and stability by training text\ngeneration from scratch.",

          "description": "Semantic parsers map natural language utterances to meaning representations.\nThe lack of a single standard for meaning representations led to the creation\nof a plethora of semantic parsing datasets. To unify different datasets and\ntrain a single model for them, we investigate the use of Multi-Task Learning\n(MTL) architectures. We experiment with five datasets (Geoquery, NLMaps, TOP,\nOvernight, AMR). We find that an MTL architecture that shares the entire\nnetwork across datasets yields competitive or better parsing accuracies than\nthe single-task baselines, while reducing the total number of parameters by\n68%. We further provide evidence that MTL has also better compositional\ngeneralization than single-task models. We also present a comparison of task\nsampling methods and propose a competitive alternative to widespread\nproportional sampling strategies.",

          "description": "Query by Example is a well-known information retrieval task in which a\ndocument is chosen by the user as the search query and the goal is to retrieve\nrelevant documents from a large collection. However, a document often covers\nmultiple aspects of a topic. To address this scenario we introduce the task of\nfaceted Query by Example in which users can also specify a finer grained aspect\nin addition to the input query document. We focus on the application of this\ntask in scientific literature search. We envision models which are able to\nretrieve scientific papers analogous to a query scientific paper along\nspecifically chosen rhetorical structure elements as one solution to this\nproblem. In this work, the rhetorical structure elements, which we refer to as\nfacets, indicate backgrounds, methods, or results of a scientific paper. We\nintroduce and describe an expert annotated test collection to evaluate models\ntrained to perform this task. Our test collection consists of a diverse set of\n50 query documents, drawn from computational linguistics and machine learning\nvenues. We carefully followed the annotation guideline used by TREC for depth-k\npooling (k = 100 or 250) and the resulting data collection consists of graded\nrelevance scores with high annotation agreement. The data is freely available\nfor research purposes.",

          "description": "Representation learning on user-item graph for recommendation has evolved\nfrom using single ID or interaction history to exploiting higher-order\nneighbors. This leads to the success of graph convolution networks (GCNs) for\nrecommendation such as PinSage and LightGCN. Despite effectiveness, we argue\nthat they suffer from two limitations: (1) high-degree nodes exert larger\nimpact on the representation learning, deteriorating the recommendations of\nlow-degree (long-tail) items; and (2) representations are vulnerable to noisy\ninteractions, as the neighborhood aggregation scheme further enlarges the\nimpact of observed edges.\n\nIn this work, we explore self-supervised learning on user-item graph, so as\nto improve the accuracy and robustness of GCNs for recommendation. The idea is\nto supplement the classical supervised task of recommendation with an auxiliary\nself-supervised task, which reinforces node representation learning via\nself-discrimination. Specifically, we generate multiple views of a node,\nmaximizing the agreement between different views of the same node compared to\nthat of other nodes. We devise three operators to generate the views -- node\ndropout, edge dropout, and random walk -- that change the graph structure in\ndifferent manners. We term this new learning paradigm as\n\\textit{Self-supervised Graph Learning} (SGL), implementing it on the\nstate-of-the-art model LightGCN. Through theoretical analyses, we find that SGL\nhas the ability of automatically mining hard negatives. Empirical studies on\nthree benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SGL, which improves\nthe recommendation accuracy, especially on long-tail items, and the robustness\nagainst interaction noises. Our implementations are available at\n\\url{https://github.com/wujcan/SGL}.",

          "description": "Pre-training and fine-tuning have achieved remarkable success in many\ndownstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recently, pre-training\nmethods tailored for information retrieval (IR) have also been explored, and\nthe latest success is the PROP method which has reached new SOTA on a variety\nof ad-hoc retrieval benchmarks. The basic idea of PROP is to construct the\n\\textit{representative words prediction} (ROP) task for pre-training inspired\nby the query likelihood model. Despite its exciting performance, the\neffectiveness of PROP might be bounded by the classical unigram language model\nadopted in the ROP task construction process. To tackle this problem, we\npropose a bootstrapped pre-training method (namely B-PROP) based on BERT for\nad-hoc retrieval. The key idea is to use the powerful contextual language model\nBERT to replace the classical unigram language model for the ROP task\nconstruction, and re-train BERT itself towards the tailored objective for IR.\nSpecifically, we introduce a novel contrastive method, inspired by the\ndivergence-from-randomness idea, to leverage BERT's self-attention mechanism to\nsample representative words from the document. By further fine-tuning on\ndownstream ad-hoc retrieval tasks, our method achieves significant improvements\nover baselines without pre-training or with other pre-training methods, and\nfurther pushes forward the SOTA on a variety of ad-hoc retrieval tasks.",

While conventional stock analysis in FinTech targets at predicting\nstock prices, less effort is made for profitable stock recommendation. Besides,\nin existing approaches on modeling time series of stock prices, the\nrelationships among stocks and sectors (i.e., categories of stocks) are either\nneglected or pre-defined. Ignoring stock relationships will miss the\ninformation shared between stocks while using pre-defined relationships cannot\ndepict the latent interactions or influence of stock prices between stocks. In\nthis work, we aim at recommending the top-K profitable stocks in terms of\nreturn ratio using time series of stock prices and sector information. We\npropose a novel deep learning-based model, Financial Graph Attention Networks\n(FinGAT), to tackle the task under the setting that no pre-defined\nrelationships between stocks are given. The idea of FinGAT is three-fold.\nFirst, we devise a hierarchical learning component to learn short-term and\nlong-term sequential patterns from stock time series. Second, a fully-connected\ngraph between stocks and a fully-connected graph between sectors are\nconstructed, along with graph attention networks, to learn the latent\ninteractions among stocks and sectors. Third, a multi-task objective is devised\nto jointly recommend the profitable stocks and predict the stock movement.\nExperiments conducted on Taiwan Stock, S&P 500, and NASDAQ datasets exhibit\nremarkable recommendation performance of our FinGAT, comparing to\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Building a benchmark dataset for hate speech detection presents several\nchallenges. Firstly, because hate speech is relatively rare -- e.g., less than\n3\\% of Twitter posts are hateful \\citep{founta2018large} -- random sampling of\ntweets to annotate is inefficient in capturing hate speech. A common practice\nis to only annotate tweets containing known ``hate words'', but this risks\nyielding a biased benchmark that only partially captures the real-world\nphenomenon of interest. A second challenge is that definitions of hate speech\ntend to be highly variable and subjective. Annotators having diverse prior\nnotions of hate speech may not only disagree with one another but also struggle\nto conform to specified labeling guidelines. Our key insight is that the rarity\nand subjectivity of hate speech are akin to that of relevance in information\nretrieval (IR). This connection suggests that well-established methodologies\nfor creating IR test collections might also be usefully applied to create\nbetter benchmark datasets for hate speech detection. Firstly, to intelligently\nand efficiently select which tweets to annotate, we apply established IR\ntechniques of {\\em pooling} and {\\em active learning}. Secondly, to improve\nboth consistency and value of annotations, we apply {\\em task decomposition}\n\\cite{Zhang-sigir14} and {\\em annotator rationale} \\cite{mcdonnell16-hcomp}\ntechniques. Using the above techniques, we create and share a new benchmark\ndataset\\footnote{We will release the dataset upon publication.} for hate speech\ndetection with broader coverage than prior datasets. We also show a dramatic\ndrop in accuracy of existing detection models when tested on these broader\nforms of hate. Collected annotator rationales not only provide documented\nsupport for labeling decisions but also create exciting future work\nopportunities for dual-supervision and/or explanation generation in modeling.",

          "description": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in online\nadvertising and recommender systems. In practice, the training of CTR models\ndepends on click data which is intrinsically biased towards higher positions\nsince higher position has higher CTR by nature. Existing methods such as actual\nposition training with fixed position inference and inverse propensity weighted\ntraining with no position inference alleviate the bias problem to some extend.\nHowever, the different treatment of position information between training and\ninference will inevitably lead to inconsistency and sub-optimal online\nperformance. Meanwhile, the basic assumption of these methods, i.e., the click\nprobability is the product of examination probability and relevance\nprobability, is oversimplified and insufficient to model the rich interaction\nbetween position and other information. In this paper, we propose a Deep\nPosition-wise Interaction Network (DPIN) to efficiently combine all candidate\nitems and positions for estimating CTR at each position, achieving consistency\nbetween offline and online as well as modeling the deep non-linear interaction\namong position, user, context and item under the limit of serving performance.\nFollowing our new treatment to the position bias in CTR prediction, we propose\na new evaluation metrics named PAUC (position-wise AUC) that is suitable for\nmeasuring the ranking quality at a given position. Through extensive\nexperiments on a real world dataset, we show empirically that our method is\nboth effective and efficient in solving position bias problem. We have also\ndeployed our method in production and observed statistically significant\nimprovement over a highly optimized baseline in a rigorous A/B test.",

Over the course of its development, supervision has been considered\nnecessary for accurate alignments. Inspired by the recent progress of\nself-supervised learning, we explore the extent to which we can get rid of\nsupervision for entity alignment. Existing supervised methods for this task\nfocus on pulling each pair of positive (labeled) entities close to each other.\nHowever, our analysis suggests that the learning of entity alignment can\nactually benefit more from pushing sampled (unlabeled) negatives far away than\npulling positive aligned pairs close. We present SelfKG by leveraging this\ndiscovery to design a contrastive learning strategy across two KGs. Extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SelfKG without supervision\ncan match or achieve comparable results with state-of-the-art supervised\nbaselines. The performance of SelfKG demonstrates self-supervised learning\noffers great potential for entity alignment in KGs.",

Besides, user\npreferences evolve over time dynamically and each preference has its own\nevolving track. However, most previous works neglect the evolving trend of\npreferences and can be easily disturbed by the effect of preference drifting.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Preference Evolution Networks for\nsession-based Recommendation (PEN4Rec) to model preference evolving process by\na two-stage retrieval from historical contexts. Specifically, the first-stage\nprocess integrates relevant behaviors according to recent items. Then, the\nsecond-stage process models the preference evolving trajectory over time\ndynamically and infer rich preferences.

          "description": "Deep learning-based sequential recommender systems have recently attracted\nincreasing attention from both academia and industry. Most of industrial\nEmbedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) system for recommendation share the similar\nideas with sequential recommenders. Among them, how to comprehensively capture\nsequential user interest is a fundamental problem. However, most existing\nsequential recommendation models take as input clicked or purchased behavior\nsequences from user-item interactions. This leads to incomprehensive user\nrepresentation and sub-optimal model performance, since they ignore the\ncomplete user behavior exposure data, i.e., items impressed yet unclicked by\nusers. In this work, we attempt to incorporate and model those unclicked item\nsequences using a new learning approach in order to explore better sequential\nrecommendation technique. An efficient triplet metric learning algorithm is\nproposed to appropriately learn the representation of unclicked items. Our\nmethod can be simply integrated with existing sequential recommendation models\nby a confidence fusion network and further gain better user representation. The\noffline experimental results based on real-world E-commerce data demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and verify the importance of unclicked items in sequential\nrecommendation.

The retrieval phase of products\ndetermines the search system's quality and gradually attracts researchers'\nattention. Retrieving the most relevant products from a large-scale corpus\nwhile preserving personalized user characteristics remains an open question.\nRecent approaches in this domain have mainly focused on embedding-based\nretrieval (EBR) systems. However, after a long period of practice on Taobao, we\nfind that the performance of the EBR system is dramatically degraded due to\nits: (1) low relevance with a given query and (2) discrepancy between the\ntraining and inference phases. Therefore, we propose a novel and practical\nembedding-based product retrieval model, named Multi-Grained Deep Semantic\nProduct Retrieval (MGDSPR). Specifically, we first identify the inconsistency\nbetween the training and inference stages, and then use the softmax\ncross-entropy loss as the training objective, which achieves better performance\nand faster convergence. Two efficient methods are further proposed to improve\nretrieval relevance, including smoothing noisy training data and generating\nrelevance-improving hard negative samples without requiring extra knowledge and\ntraining procedures. We evaluate MGDSPR on Taobao Product Search with\nsignificant metrics gains observed in offline experiments and online A/B tests.\nMGDSPR has been successfully deployed to the existing multi-channel retrieval\nsystem in Taobao Search. We also introduce the online deployment scheme and\nshare practical lessons of our retrieval system to contribute to the community.",

We have found that\nUkrainian economics is characterized by a comparably small share of co-authored\npublications, however, it demonstrates the tendency towards more collaborative\noutput. Based on our analysis, we discuss specific and universal features of\nUkrainian economic research. The importance of supporting various initiatives\naimed at enriching open scholarly metadata is considered. A comprehensive and\nhigh-quality meta description of publications is probably the shortest path to\na better understanding of national trends, especially for non-English speaking\ncountries. The results of our analysis can be used to better understand\nUkrainian economic research and support research policy decisions.",

          "description": "The development of deep neural networks and the emergence of pre-trained\nlanguage models such as BERT allow to increase performance on many NLP tasks.\nHowever, these models do not meet the same popularity for tweet summarization,\nwhich can probably be explained by the lack of existing collections for\ntraining and evaluation. Our contribution in this paper is twofold : (1) we\nintroduce a large dataset for Twitter event summarization, and (2) we propose a\nneural model to automatically summarize huge tweet streams. This extractive\nmodel combines in an original way pre-trained language models and vocabulary\nfrequency-based representations to predict tweet salience. An additional\nadvantage of the model is that it automatically adapts the size of the output\nsummary according to the input tweet stream. We conducted experiments using two\ndifferent Twitter collections, and promising results are observed in comparison\nwith state-of-the-art baselines.",

          "description": "Personalized news recommendation is an important technique to help users find\ntheir interested news information and alleviate their information overload. It\nhas been extensively studied over decades and has achieved notable success in\nimproving users' news reading experience. However, there are still many\nunsolved problems and challenges that need to be further studied. To help\nresearchers master the advances in personalized news recommendation over the\npast years, in this paper we present a comprehensive overview of personalized\nnews recommendation. Instead of following the conventional taxonomy of news\nrecommendation methods, in this paper we propose a novel perspective to\nunderstand personalized news recommendation based on its core problems and the\nassociated techniques and challenges. We first review the techniques for\ntackling each core problem in a personalized news recommender system and the\nchallenges they face. Next, we introduce the public datasets and evaluation\nmetrics used for personalized news recommendation. We then discuss the key\npoints on improving the responsibility of personalized news recommender\nsystems. Finally, we raise several research directions that are worth\ninvestigating in future. This paper can provide up-to-date and comprehensive\nviews to help readers understand the personalized news recommendation field. We\nhope this paper can facilitate research on personalized news recommendation and\nas well as related fields in natural language processing and data mining.",

In this paper, we propose TUTA, a\nunified pre-training architecture for understanding generally structured\ntables. Noticing that understanding a table requires spatial, hierarchical, and\nsemantic information, we enhance transformers with three novel structure-aware\nmechanisms. First, we devise a unified tree-based structure, called a\nbi-dimensional coordinate tree, to describe both the spatial and hierarchical\ninformation of generally structured tables. Upon this, we propose tree-based\nattention and position embedding to better capture the spatial and hierarchical\ninformation. Moreover, we devise three progressive pre-training objectives to\nenable representations at the token, cell, and table levels. We pre-train TUTA\non a wide range of unlabeled web and spreadsheet tables and fine-tune it on two\ncritical tasks in the field of table structure understanding: cell type\nclassification and table type classification.

          "description": "Recommender Systems (RS) have employed knowledge distillation which is a\nmodel compression technique training a compact student model with the knowledge\ntransferred from a pre-trained large teacher model. Recent work has shown that\ntransferring knowledge from the teacher's intermediate layer significantly\nimproves the recommendation quality of the student. However, they transfer the\nknowledge of individual representation point-wise and thus have a limitation in\nthat primary information of RS lies in the relations in the representation\nspace. This paper proposes a new topology distillation approach that guides the\nstudent by transferring the topological structure built upon the relations in\nthe teacher space. We first observe that simply making the student learn the\nwhole topological structure is not always effective and even degrades the\nstudent's performance. We demonstrate that because the capacity of the student\nis highly limited compared to that of the teacher, learning the whole\ntopological structure is daunting for the student. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel method named Hierarchical Topology Distillation (HTD) which\ndistills the topology hierarchically to cope with the large capacity gap. Our\nextensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed method\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors. We also provide\nin-depth analyses to ascertain the benefit of distilling the topology for RS.",

          "description": "With the emerging needs of creating fairness-aware solutions for search and\nrecommendation systems, a daunting challenge exists of evaluating such\nsolutions. While many of the traditional information retrieval (IR) metrics can\ncapture the relevance, diversity and novelty for the utility with respect to\nusers, they are not suitable for inferring whether the presented results are\nfair from the perspective of responsible information exposure. On the other\nhand, various fairness metrics have been proposed but they do not account for\nthe user utility or do not measure it adequately. To address this problem, we\npropose a new metric called Fairness-Aware IR (FAIR). By unifying standard IR\nmetrics and fairness measures into an integrated metric, this metric offers a\nnew perspective for evaluating fairness-aware ranking results. Based on this\nmetric, we developed an effective ranking algorithm that jointly optimized user\nutility and fairness. The experimental results showed that our FAIR metric\ncould highlight results with good user utility and fair information exposure.\nWe showed how FAIR related to existing metrics and demonstrated the\neffectiveness of our FAIR-based algorithm. We believe our work opens up a new\ndirection of pursuing a computationally feasible metric for evaluating and\nimplementing the fairness-aware IR systems.",

          "description": "We analyse the performance of passage retrieval models in the presence of\ncomplex (multi-hop) questions to provide a better understanding of how\nretrieval systems behave when multiple hops of reasoning are needed. In simple\nopen-domain question answering (QA), dense passage retrieval has become one of\nthe standard approaches for retrieving the relevant passages to infer an\nanswer. Recently, dense passage retrieval also achieved state-of-the-art\nresults in multi-hop QA, where aggregating information from multiple documents\nand reasoning over them is required. However, so far, the dense retrieval\nmodels are not evaluated properly concerning the multi-hop nature of the\nproblem: models are typically evaluated by the end result of the retrieval\npipeline, which leaves unclear where their success lies. In this work, we\nprovide an in-depth evaluation of such models not only unveiling the reasons\nbehind their success but also their limitations. Moreover, we introduce a\nhybrid (lexical and dense) retrieval approach that is highly competitive with\nthe state-of-the-art dense retrieval model, while requiring substantially less\ncomputational resources.

          "description": "Question answering (QA) systems for large document collections typically use\npipelines that (i) retrieve possibly relevant documents, (ii) re-rank them,\n(iii) rank paragraphs or other snippets of the top-ranked documents, and (iv)\nselect spans of the top-ranked snippets as exact answers. Pipelines are\nconceptually simple, but errors propagate from one component to the next,\nwithout later components being able to revise earlier decisions. We present an\narchitecture for joint document and snippet ranking, the two middle stages,\nwhich leverages the intuition that relevant documents have good snippets and\ngood snippets come from relevant documents. The architecture is general and can\nbe used with any neural text relevance ranker. We experiment with two main\ninstantiations of the architecture, based on POSIT-DRMM (PDRMM) and a\nBERT-based ranker. Experiments on biomedical data from BIOASQ show that our\njoint models vastly outperform the pipelines in snippet retrieval, the main\ngoal for QA, with fewer trainable parameters, also remaining competitive in\ndocument retrieval. Furthermore, our joint PDRMM-based model is competitive\nwith BERT-based models, despite using orders of magnitude fewer parameters.\nThese claims are also supported by human evaluation on two test batches of\nBIOASQ. To test our key findings on another dataset, we modified the Natural\nQuestions dataset so that it can also be used for document and snippet\nretrieval. Our joint PDRMM-based model again outperforms the corresponding\npipeline in snippet retrieval on the modified Natural Questions dataset, even\nthough it performs worse than the pipeline in document retrieval.

          "description": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction models are common in many online\napplications such as digital advertising and recommender systems. Field-Aware\nFactorization Machine (FFM) and Field-weighted Factorization Machine (FwFM) are\nstate-of-the-art among the shallow models for CTR prediction. Recently, many\ndeep learning-based models have also been proposed. Among deeper models,\nDeepFM, xDeepFM, AutoInt+, and FiBiNet are state-of-the-art models. The deeper\nmodels combine a core architectural component, which learns explicit feature\ninteractions, with a deep neural network (DNN) component. We propose a novel\nshallow Field-Embedded Factorization Machine (FEFM) and its deep counterpart\nDeep Field-Embedded Factorization Machine (DeepFEFM). FEFM learns symmetric\nmatrix embeddings for each field pair along with the usual single vector\nembeddings for each feature. FEFM has significantly lower model complexity than\nFFM and roughly the same complexity as FwFM. FEFM also has insightful\nmathematical properties about important fields and field interactions. DeepFEFM\ncombines the FEFM interaction vectors learned by the FEFM component with a DNN\nand is thus able to learn higher order interactions. We conducted comprehensive\nexperiments over a wide range of hyperparameters on two large publicly\navailable real-world datasets. When comparing test AUC and log loss, the\nresults show that FEFM and DeepFEFM outperform the existing state-of-the-art\nshallow and deep models for CTR prediction tasks.

          "description": "Multi-hop logical reasoning is an established problem in the field of\nrepresentation learning on knowledge graphs (KGs). It subsumes both one-hop\nlink prediction as well as other more complex types of logical queries.\nExisting algorithms operate only on classical, triple-based graphs, whereas\nmodern KGs often employ a hyper-relational modeling paradigm. In this paradigm,\ntyped edges may have several key-value pairs known as qualifiers that provide\nfine-grained context for facts. In queries, this context modifies the meaning\nof relations, and usually reduces the answer set. Hyper-relational queries are\noften observed in real-world KG applications, and existing approaches for\napproximate query answering cannot make use of qualifier pairs. In this work,\nwe bridge this gap and extend the multi-hop reasoning problem to\nhyper-relational KGs allowing to tackle this new type of complex queries.\nBuilding upon recent advancements in Graph Neural Networks and query embedding\ntechniques, we study how to embed and answer hyper-relational conjunctive\nqueries. Besides that, we propose a method to answer such queries and\ndemonstrate in our experiments that qualifiers improve query answering on a\ndiverse set of query patterns.",

Recent progress in CTR prediction\nenjoys the rich representation capabilities of deep learning and achieves great\nsuccess in large-scale industrial applications. However, these methods can\nsuffer from lack of exploration. Another line of prior work addresses the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off problem with contextual bandit methods,\nwhich are recently less studied in the industry due to the difficulty in\nextending their flexibility with deep models. In this paper, we propose a novel\nDeep Uncertainty-Aware Learning (DUAL) method to learn CTR models based on\nGaussian processes, which can provide predictive uncertainty estimations while\nmaintaining the flexibility of deep neural networks. DUAL can be easily\nimplemented on existing models and deployed in real-time systems with minimal\nextra computational overhead. By linking the predictive uncertainty estimation\nability of DUAL to well-known bandit algorithms, we further present DUAL-based\nAd-ranking strategies to boost up long-term utilities such as the social\nwelfare in advertising systems. Experimental results on several public datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

          "description": "Recently, neural networks have been successfully employed to improve upon\nstate-of-the-art performance in ad-hoc retrieval tasks via machine-learned\nranking functions. While neural retrieval models grow in complexity and impact,\nlittle is understood about their correspondence with well-studied IR\nprinciples. Recent work on interpretability in machine learning has provided\ntools and techniques to understand neural models in general, yet there has been\nlittle progress towards explaining ranking models.\n\nWe investigate whether one can explain the behavior of neural ranking models\nin terms of their congruence with well understood principles of document\nranking by using established theories from axiomatic IR. Axiomatic analysis of\ninformation retrieval models has formalized a set of constraints on ranking\ndecisions that reasonable retrieval models should fulfill. We operationalize\nthis axiomatic thinking to reproduce rankings based on combinations of\nelementary constraints. This allows us to investigate to what extent the\nranking decisions of neural rankers can be explained in terms of retrieval\naxioms, and which axioms apply in which situations. Our experimental study\nconsiders a comprehensive set of axioms over several representative neural\nrankers. While the existing axioms can already explain the particularly\nconfident ranking decisions rather well, future work should extend the axiom\nset to also cover the other still \"unexplainable\" neural IR rank decisions.",

          "description": "Making accurate recommendations for cold-start users has been a longstanding\nand critical challenge for recommender systems (RS). Cross-domain\nrecommendations (CDR) offer a solution to tackle such a cold-start problem when\nthere is no sufficient data for the users who have rarely used the system. An\neffective approach in CDR is to leverage the knowledge (e.g., user\nrepresentations) learned from a related but different domain and transfer it to\nthe target domain. Fine-tuning works as an effective transfer learning\ntechnique for this objective, which adapts the parameters of a pre-trained\nmodel from the source domain to the target domain. However, current methods are\nmainly based on the global fine-tuning strategy: the decision of which layers\nof the pre-trained model to freeze or fine-tune is taken for all users in the\ntarget domain. In this paper, we argue that users in RS are personalized and\nshould have their own fine-tuning policies for better preference transfer\nlearning. As such, we propose a novel User-specific Adaptive Fine-tuning method\n(UAF), selecting which layers of the pre-trained network to fine-tune, on a\nper-user basis. Specifically, we devise a policy network with three alternative\nstrategies to automatically decide which layers to be fine-tuned and which\nlayers to have their parameters frozen for each user. Extensive experiments\nshow that the proposed UAF exhibits significantly better and more robust\nperformance for user cold-start recommendation.",

          "description": "The amount of archaeological literature is growing rapidly. Until recently,\nthese data were only accessible through metadata search. We implemented a text\nretrieval engine for a large archaeological text collection ($\\sim 658$ Million\nwords). In archaeological IR, domain-specific entities such as locations, time\nperiods, and artefacts, play a central role. This motivated the development of\na named entity recognition (NER) model to annotate the full collection with\narchaeological named entities. In this paper, we present ArcheoBERTje, a BERT\nmodel pre-trained on Dutch archaeological texts. We compare the model's quality\nand output on a Named Entity Recognition task to a generic multilingual model\nand a generic Dutch model. We also investigate ensemble methods for combining\nmultiple BERT models, and combining the best BERT model with a domain thesaurus\nusing Conditional Random Fields (CRF). We find that ArcheoBERTje outperforms\nboth the multilingual and Dutch model significantly with a smaller standard\ndeviation between runs, reaching an average F1 score of 0.735. The model also\noutperforms ensemble methods combining the three models. Combining ArcheoBERTje\npredictions and explicit domain knowledge from the thesaurus did not increase\nthe F1 score. We quantitatively and qualitatively analyse the differences\nbetween the vocabulary and output of the BERT models on the full collection and\nprovide some valuable insights in the effect of fine-tuning for specific\ndomains. Our results indicate that for a highly specific text domain such as\narchaeology, further pre-training on domain-specific data increases the model's\nquality on NER by a much larger margin than shown for other domains in the\nliterature, and that domain-specific pre-training makes the addition of domain\nknowledge from a thesaurus unnecessary.",

          "description": "With the popularity of Machine Learning (ML) solutions, algorithms and data\nhave been released faster than the capacity of processing them. In this\ncontext, the problem of Algorithm Recommendation (AR) is receiving a\nsignificant deal of attention recently. This problem has been addressed in the\nliterature as a learning task, often as a Meta-Learning problem where the aim\nis to recommend the best alternative for a specific dataset. For such, datasets\nencoded by meta-features are explored by ML algorithms that try to learn the\nmapping between meta-representations and the best technique to be used. One of\nthe challenges for the successful use of ML is to define which features are the\nmost valuable for a specific dataset since several meta-features can be used,\nwhich increases the meta-feature dimension. This paper presents an empirical\nanalysis of Feature Selection and Feature Extraction in the meta-level for the\nAR problem. The present study was focused on three criteria: predictive\nperformance, dimensionality reduction, and pipeline runtime. As we verified,\napplying Dimensionality Reduction (DR) methods did not improve predictive\nperformances in general. However, DR solutions reduced about 80% of the\nmeta-features, obtaining pretty much the same performance as the original setup\nbut with lower runtimes. The only exception was PCA, which presented about the\nsame runtime as the original meta-features. Experimental results also showed\nthat various datasets have many non-informative meta-features and that it is\npossible to obtain high predictive performance using around 20% of the original\nmeta-features. Therefore, due to their natural trend for high dimensionality,\nDR methods should be used for Meta-Feature Selection and Meta-Feature\nExtraction.",

Simulation experiments based on Taobao online bidding data show\nthat the designed algorithms can effectively optimize the strategy adoption\nrate of advertisers.",

Different from existing datasets such as GLUE, SuperGLUE,\nXGLUE and XTREME that mainly focus on natural language tasks, GEM is a\nlarge-scale vision-language benchmark, which consists of GEM-I for\nimage-language tasks and GEM-V for video-language tasks. Comparing with\nexisting multimodal datasets such as MSCOCO and Flicker30K for image-language\ntasks, YouCook2 and MSR-VTT for video-language tasks, GEM is not only the\nlargest vision-language dataset covering image-language tasks and\nvideo-language tasks at the same time, but also labeled in multiple languages.\nWe also provide two baseline models for this benchmark. We will release the\ndataset, code and baseline models, aiming to advance the development of\nmultilingual multimodal research.",

We present a system to\nstreamline the creation of audio-driven visualisations based on audio feature\nextraction and mapping interfaces. Its architecture is based on three modular\nsoftware components: backend (audio plugin), frontend (3D game-like\nenvironment), and middleware (visual mapping interface). We conducted a user\nevaluation comprising two stages. Results from the first stage (34\nparticipants) indicate that music visualisations generated with the system were\nsignificantly better at complementing the music than a baseline visualisation.\nNine participants took part in the second stage involving interactive tasks.\nOverall, the system yielded a Creativity Support Index above average (68.1) and\na System Usability Scale index (58.6) suggesting that ease of use can be\nimproved. Thematic analysis revealed that participants enjoyed the system's\nsynchronicity and expressive capabilities, but found technical problems and\ndifficulties understanding the audio feature terminology.",

          "description": "Steganography comprises the mechanics of hiding data in a host media that may\nbe publicly available. While previous works focused on unimodal setups (e.g.,\nhiding images in images, or hiding audio in audio), PixInWav targets the\nmultimodal case of hiding images in audio. To this end, we propose a novel\nresidual architecture operating on top of short-time discrete cosine transform\n(STDCT) audio spectrograms. Among our results, we find that the residual audio\nsteganography setup we propose allows independent encoding of the hidden image\nfrom the host audio without compromising quality. Accordingly, while previous\nworks require both host and hidden signals to hide a signal, PixInWav can\nencode images offline -- which can be later hidden, in a residual fashion, into\nany audio signal. Finally, we test our scheme in a lab setting to transmit\nimages over airwaves from a loudspeaker to a microphone verifying our\ntheoretical insights and obtaining promising results.",

          "description": "Recently, there has been an increasing interest in neural speech synthesis.\nWhile the deep neural network achieves the state-of-the-art result in\ntext-to-speech (TTS) tasks, how to generate a more emotional and more\nexpressive speech is becoming a new challenge to researchers due to the\nscarcity of high-quality emotion speech dataset and the lack of advanced\nemotional TTS model. In this paper, we first briefly introduce and publicly\nrelease a Mandarin emotion speech dataset including 9,724 samples with audio\nfiles and its emotion human-labeled annotation. After that, we propose a simple\nbut efficient architecture for emotional speech synthesis called EMSpeech.\nUnlike those models which need additional reference audio as input, our model\ncould predict emotion labels just from the input text and generate more\nexpressive speech conditioned on the emotion embedding. In the experiment\nphase, we first validate the effectiveness of our dataset by an emotion\nclassification task. Then we train our model on the proposed dataset and\nconduct a series of subjective evaluations. Finally, by showing a comparable\nperformance in the emotional speech synthesis task, we successfully demonstrate\nthe ability of the proposed model.",

We resolve this problem by introducing a robust unsupervised\nmulti-object tracking (MOT) model: AttU-Net.

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved remarkable performance in various\nfields. However, training a DNN model from scratch requires a lot of computing\nresources and training data. It is difficult for most individual users to\nobtain such computing resources and training data. Model copyright infringement\nis an emerging problem in recent years. For instance, pre-trained models may be\nstolen or abuse by illegal users without the authorization of the model owner.\nRecently, many works on protecting the intellectual property of DNN models have\nbeen proposed. In these works, embedding watermarks into DNN based on backdoor\nis one of the widely used methods. However, when the DNN model is stolen, the\nbackdoor-based watermark may face the risk of being detected and removed by an\nadversary. In this paper, we propose a scheme to detect and remove watermark in\ndeep neural networks via generative adversarial networks (GAN). We demonstrate\nthat the backdoor-based DNN watermarks are vulnerable to the proposed GAN-based\nwatermark removal attack. The proposed attack method includes two phases. In\nthe first phase, we use the GAN and few clean images to detect and reverse the\nwatermark in the DNN model. In the second phase, we fine-tune the watermarked\nDNN based on the reversed backdoor images. Experimental evaluations on the\nMNIST and CIFAR10 datasets demonstrate that, the proposed method can\neffectively remove about 98% of the watermark in DNN models, as the watermark\nretention rate reduces from 100% to less than 2% after applying the proposed\nattack. In the meantime, the proposed attack hardly affects the model's\nperformance. The test accuracy of the watermarked DNN on the MNIST and the\nCIFAR10 datasets drops by less than 1% and 3%, respectively.",

          "description": "Legacy black-and-white photos are riddled with people's nostalgia and\nglorious memories of the past. To better relive the elapsed frozen moments, in\nthis paper, we present a deep exemplar-based image colorization approach named\nColor2Style to resurrect these grayscale image media by filling them with\nvibrant colors. Generally, for exemplar-based colorization, unsupervised and\nunpaired training are usually adopted, due to the difficulty of obtaining input\nand ground truth image pairs. To train an exemplar-based colorization model,\ncurrent algorithms usually strive to achieve two procedures: i) retrieving a\nlarge number of reference images with high similarity in advance, which is\ninevitably time-consuming and tedious; ii) designing complicated modules to\ntransfer the colors of the reference image to the grayscale image, by\ncalculating and leveraging the deep semantic correspondence between them (e.g.,\nnon-local operation). Contrary to the previous methods, we solve and simplify\nthe above two steps in one end-to-end learning procedure. First, we adopt a\nself-augmented self-reference training scheme, where the reference image is\ngenerated by graphical transformations from the original colorful one whereby\nthe training can be formulated in a paired manner. Second, instead of computing\ncomplex and inexplicable correspondence maps, our method exploits a simple yet\neffective deep feature modulation (DFM) module, which injects the color\nembeddings extracted from the reference image into the deep representations of\nthe input grayscale image. Such design is much more lightweight and\nintelligible, achieving appealing performance with real-time processing speed.\nMoreover, our model does not require multifarious loss functions and\nregularization terms like existing methods, but only two widely used loss\nfunctions.

          "description": "Deep-learning\\textendash{centric} reversible steganography has emerged as a\npromising research paradigm. A direct way of applying deep learning to\nreversible steganography is to construct a pair of encoder and decoder, whose\nparameters are trained jointly, thereby learning the steganographic system as a\nwhole. This end-to-end framework, however, falls short of the reversibility\nrequirement because it is difficult for this kind of monolithic system, as a\nblack box, to create or duplicate intricate reversible mechanisms. In response\nto this issue, a recent approach is to carve up the steganographic system and\nwork on modules independently. In particular, neural networks are deployed in\nan analytics module to learn the data distribution, while an established\nmechanism is called upon to handle the remaining tasks. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the modular framework and deploy deep neural networks in a\nreversible steganographic scheme referred to as prediction-error modulation, in\nwhich an analytics module serves the purpose of pixel intensity prediction. The\nprimary focus of this study is on deep-learning\\textendash{based} context-aware\npixel intensity prediction.

          "description": "Recently normalizing flows (NFs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art\nperformance on modeling 3D point clouds while allowing sampling with arbitrary\nresolution at inference time. However, these flow-based models still require\nlong training times and large models for representing complicated geometries.\nThis work enhances their representational power by applying mixtures of NFs to\npoint clouds. We show that in this more general framework each component learns\nto specialize in a particular subregion of an object in a completely\nunsupervised fashion. By instantiating each mixture component with a\ncomparatively small NF we generate point clouds with improved details compared\nto single-flow-based models while using fewer parameters and considerably\nreducing the inference runtime. We further demonstrate that by adding data\naugmentation, individual mixture components can learn to specialize in a\nsemantically meaningful manner. We evaluate mixtures of NFs on generation,\nautoencoding and single-view reconstruction based on the ShapeNet dataset.",

          "description": "3D human body reconstruction from monocular images is an interesting and\nill-posed problem in computer vision with wider applications in multiple\ndomains. In this paper, we propose SHARP, a novel end-to-end trainable network\nthat accurately recovers the detailed geometry and appearance of 3D people in\nloose clothing from a monocular image. We propose a sparse and efficient fusion\nof a parametric body prior with a non-parametric peeled depth map\nrepresentation of clothed models. The parametric body prior constraints our\nmodel in two ways: first, the network retains geometrically consistent body\nparts that are not occluded by clothing, and second, it provides a body shape\ncontext that improves prediction of the peeled depth maps. This enables SHARP\nto recover fine-grained 3D geometrical details with just L1 losses on the 2D\nmaps, given an input image. We evaluate SHARP on publicly available Cloth3D and\nTHuman datasets and report superior performance to state-of-the-art approaches.",

          "description": "Retinal artery/vein (A/V) classification is a critical technique for\ndiagnosing diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Although deep learning based\nmethods achieve impressive results in A/V classification, their performances\nusually degrade severely when being directly applied to another database, due\nto the domain shift, e.g., caused by the variations in imaging protocols. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel vessel-mixing based consistency regularization\nframework, for cross-domain learning in retinal A/V classification. Specially,\nto alleviate the severe bias to source domain, based on the label smooth prior,\nthe model is regularized to give consistent predictions for unlabeled\ntarget-domain inputs that are under perturbation. This consistency\nregularization implicitly introduces a mechanism where the model and the\nperturbation is opponent to each other, where the model is pushed to be robust\nenough to cope with the perturbation. Thus, we investigate a more difficult\nopponent to further inspire the robustness of model, in the scenario of retinal\nA/V, called vessel-mixing perturbation. Specially, it effectively disturbs the\nfundus images especially the vessel structures by mixing two images regionally.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on cross-domain A/V classification using four\npublic datasets, which are collected by diverse institutions and imaging\ndevices. The results demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art\ncross-domain performance, which is also close to the upper bound obtained by\nfully supervised learning on target domain.",

          "description": "We define the concept of CompositeTasking as the fusion of multiple,\nspatially distributed tasks, for various aspects of image understanding.\nLearning to perform spatially distributed tasks is motivated by the frequent\navailability of only sparse labels across tasks, and the desire for a compact\nmulti-tasking network. To facilitate CompositeTasking, we introduce a novel\ntask conditioning model -- a single encoder-decoder network that performs\nmultiple, spatially varying tasks at once. The proposed network takes an image\nand a set of pixel-wise dense task requests as inputs, and performs the\nrequested prediction task for each pixel. Moreover, we also learn the\ncomposition of tasks that needs to be performed according to some\nCompositeTasking rules, which includes the decision of where to apply which\ntask. It not only offers us a compact network for multi-tasking, but also\nallows for task-editing. Another strength of the proposed method is\ndemonstrated by only having to supply sparse supervision per task. The obtained\nresults are on par with our baselines that use dense supervision and a\nmulti-headed multi-tasking design.

          "description": "Despite the great progress made by deep neural networks in the semantic\nsegmentation task, traditional neural-networkbased methods typically suffer\nfrom a shortage of large amounts of pixel-level annotations. Recent progress in\nfewshot semantic segmentation tackles the issue by only a few pixel-level\nannotated examples. However, these few-shot approaches cannot easily be applied\nto multi-way or weak annotation settings. In this paper, we advance the\nfew-shot segmentation paradigm towards a scenario where image-level annotations\nare available to help the training process of a few pixel-level annotations.\nOur key idea is to learn a better prototype representation of the class by\nfusing the knowledge from the image-level labeled data. Specifically, we\npropose a new framework, called PAIA, to learn the class prototype\nrepresentation in a metric space by integrating image-level annotations.\nFurthermore, by considering the uncertainty of pseudo-masks, a distilled soft\nmasked average pooling strategy is designed to handle distractions in\nimage-level annotations. Extensive empirical results on two datasets show\nsuperior performance of PAIA.",

Such images can be helpful in tasks such as\nanomaly detection and understanding changes induced by pathology and disease.\nIn this paper, we present a model that is encouraged to disentangle the\ninformation of pathology from what seems to be healthy. We disentangle what\nappears to be healthy and where disease is as a segmentation map, which are\nthen recombined by a network to reconstruct the input disease image. We train\nour models adversarially using either paired or unpaired settings, where we\npair disease images and maps when available. We quantitatively and\nsubjectively, with a human study, evaluate the quality of pseudo-healthy images\nusing several criteria. We show in a series of experiments, performed on ISLES,\nBraTS and Cam-CAN datasets, that our method is better than several baselines\nand methods from the literature.

          "description": "Vision Transformers (ViT) have been shown to attain highly competitive\nperformance for a wide range of vision applications, such as image\nclassification, object detection and semantic image segmentation. In comparison\nto convolutional neural networks, the Vision Transformer's weaker inductive\nbias is generally found to cause an increased reliance on model regularization\nor data augmentation (``AugReg'' for short) when training on smaller training\ndatasets. We conduct a systematic empirical study in order to better understand\nthe interplay between the amount of training data, AugReg, model size and\ncompute budget. As one result of this study we find that the combination of\nincreased compute and AugReg can yield models with the same performance as\nmodels trained on an order of magnitude more training data: we train ViT models\nof various sizes on the public ImageNet-21k dataset which either match or\noutperform their counterparts trained on the larger, but not publicly available\nJFT-300M dataset.",

          "description": "Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results on\nvarious vision tasks. Yet, their generalization ability under different\ndistribution shifts is rarely understood. In this work, we provide a\ncomprehensive study on the out-of-distribution generalization of ViTs. To\nsupport a systematic investigation, we first present a taxonomy of distribution\nshifts by categorizing them into five conceptual groups: corruption shift,\nbackground shift, texture shift, destruction shift, and style shift. Then we\nperform extensive evaluations of ViT variants under different groups of\ndistribution shifts and compare their generalization ability with CNNs. Several\nimportant observations are obtained: 1) ViTs generalize better than CNNs under\nmultiple distribution shifts. With the same or fewer parameters, ViTs are ahead\nof corresponding CNNs by more than 5% in top-1 accuracy under most distribution\nshifts. 2) Larger ViTs gradually narrow the in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution performance gap. To further improve the generalization of\nViTs, we design the Generalization-Enhanced ViTs by integrating adversarial\nlearning, information theory, and self-supervised learning. By investigating\nthree types of generalization-enhanced ViTs, we observe their\ngradient-sensitivity and design a smoother learning strategy to achieve a\nstable training process. With modified training schemes, we achieve\nimprovements on performance towards out-of-distribution data by 4% from vanilla\nViTs. We comprehensively compare three generalization-enhanced ViTs with their\ncorresponding CNNs, and observe that: 1) For the enhanced model, larger ViTs\nstill benefit more for the out-of-distribution generalization. 2)\ngeneralization-enhanced ViTs are more sensitive to the hyper-parameters than\ncorresponding CNNs. We hope our comprehensive study could shed light on the\ndesign of more generalizable learning architectures.",

          "description": "Collecting a large number of reliable training images annotated by multiple\nland-cover class labels in the framework of multi-label classification is\ntime-consuming and costly in remote sensing (RS). To address this problem,\npublicly available thematic products are often used for annotating RS images\nwith zero-labeling-cost. However, such an approach may result in constructing a\ntraining set with noisy multi-labels, distorting the learning process. To\naddress this problem, we propose a Consensual Collaborative Multi-Label\nLearning (CCML) method. The proposed CCML identifies, ranks and corrects\ntraining images with noisy multi-labels through four main modules: 1)\ndiscrepancy module; 2) group lasso module; 3) flipping module; and 4) swap\nmodule. The discrepancy module ensures that the two networks learn diverse\nfeatures, while obtaining the same predictions. The group lasso module detects\nthe potentially noisy labels by estimating the label uncertainty based on the\naggregation of two collaborative networks. The flipping module corrects the\nidentified noisy labels, whereas the swap module exchanges the ranking\ninformation between the two networks. The experimental results confirm the\nsuccess of the proposed CCML under high (synthetically added) multi-label noise\nrates. The code of the proposed method is publicly available at\nhttps://noisy-labels-in-rs.org",

While games are not merely\nimages, neural network models trained on game pixels often capture differences\nof the visual style of the image rather than the content of the game. As a\nresult, such models cannot generalize well even within similar games of the\nsame genre. In this paper we build on recent advances in contrastive learning\nand showcase its benefits for representation learning in games. Learning to\ncontrast images of games not only classifies games in a more efficient manner;\nit also yields models that separate games in a more meaningful fashion by\nignoring the visual style and focusing, instead, on their content. Our results\nin a large dataset of sports video games containing 100k images across 175\ngames and 10 game genres suggest that contrastive learning is better suited for\nlearning generalized game representations compared to conventional supervised\nlearning. The findings of this study bring us closer to universal visual\nencoders for games that can be reused across previously unseen games without\nrequiring retraining or fine-tuning.",

Recent work has shown that it is possible to learn\na unified dense pose predictor for several categories of related objects.\nHowever, training such models requires to initialize inter-category\ncorrespondences by hand. This is suboptimal and the resulting models fail to\nmaintain correct correspondences as individual categories are learned. In this\npaper, we show that improved correspondences can be learned automatically as a\nnatural byproduct of learning category-specific dense pose predictors. To do\nthis, we express correspondences between different categories and between\nimages and categories using a unified embedding. Then, we use the latter to\nenforce two constraints: symmetric inter-category cycle consistency and a new\nasymmetric image-to-category cycle consistency. Without any manual annotations\nfor the inter-category correspondences, we obtain state-of-the-art alignment\nresults, outperforming dedicated methods for matching 3D shapes. Moreover, the\nnew model is also better at the task of dense pose prediction than prior work.",

In this paper, we study a\nfundamental problem in this context about recovering a surface mesh from an\nimplicit field function whose zero-level set captures the underlying surface.\nTo achieve the goal, existing methods rely on traditional meshing algorithms;\nwhile promising, they suffer from loss of precision learned in the implicit\nsurface networks, due to the use of discrete space sampling in marching cubes.\nGiven that an MLP with activations of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) partitions\nits input space into a number of linear regions, we are motivated to connect\nthis local linearity with a same property owned by the desired result of\npolygon mesh. More specifically, we identify from the linear regions,\npartitioned by an MLP based implicit function, the analytic cells and analytic\nfaces that are associated with the function's zero-level isosurface. We prove\nthat under mild conditions, the identified analytic faces are guaranteed to\nconnect and form a closed, piecewise planar surface. Based on the theorem, we\npropose an algorithm of analytic marching, which marches among analytic cells\nto exactly recover the mesh captured by an implicit surface network. We also\nshow that our theory and algorithm are equally applicable to advanced MLPs with\nshortcut connections and max pooling. Given the parallel nature of analytic\nmarching, we contribute AnalyticMesh, a software package that supports\nefficient meshing of implicit surface networks via CUDA parallel computing, and\nmesh simplification for efficient downstream processing.

We achieve this by proposing to generate virtual temporal\nsamples from labelled still images. This allows us, with no extra annotation\neffort, to generate virtually labelled temporal sequences. Normally, to train a\nrecurrent neural network (RNN), labelled samples from a video (temporal)\nsequence are required which is laborious and has stymied work in this\ndirection. By generating virtual temporal samples, we demonstrate that it is\npossible to train a lightweight RNN to perform semantic segmentation on two\nchallenging agricultural datasets. Our results show that by training a temporal\nsemantic segmenter using virtual samples we can increase the performance by an\nabsolute amount of 4.6 and 4.9 on sweet pepper and sugar beet datasets,\nrespectively.

          "description": "Novelty detection is the process of determining whether a query example\ndiffers from the learned training distribution. Previous methods attempt to\nlearn the representation of the normal samples via generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs). However, they will suffer from instability training, mode\ndropping, and low discriminative ability. Recently, various pretext tasks (e.g.\nrotation prediction and clustering) have been proposed for self-supervised\nlearning in novelty detection. However, the learned latent features are still\nlow discriminative. We overcome such problems by introducing a novel\ndecoder-encoder framework. Firstly, a generative network (a.k.a. decoder)\nlearns the representation by mapping the initialized latent vector to an image.\nIn particular, this vector is initialized by considering the entire\ndistribution of training data to avoid the problem of mode-dropping. Secondly,\na contrastive network (a.k.a. encoder) aims to ``learn to compare'' through\nmutual information estimation, which directly helps the generative network to\nobtain a more discriminative representation by using a negative data\naugmentation strategy. Extensive experiments show that our model has\nsignificant superiority over cutting-edge novelty detectors and achieves new\nstate-of-the-art results on some novelty detection benchmarks, e.g. CIFAR10 and\nDCASE. Moreover, our model is more stable for training in a non-adversarial\nmanner, compared to other adversarial based novelty detection methods.",

In the conventional generative replay, the generative\nmodel is pre-trained for old data and shared in extra memory for later\nincremental learning. In our proposed DF-GR, we train a generative model from\nscratch without using any training data, based on the pre-trained\nclassification model from the past, so we curtail the cost of sharing\npre-trained generative models. Second, we introduce dual-teacher information\ndistillation (DT-ID) for knowledge distillation from two teachers to one\nstudent. In CIL, we use DT-ID to learn new classes incrementally based on the\npre-trained model for old classes and another model (pre-)trained on the new\ndata for new classes. We implemented the proposed schemes on top of one of the\nstate-of-the-art CIL methods and showed the performance improvement on\nCIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets.",

          "description": "Instance-level contrastive learning techniques, which rely on data\naugmentation and a contrastive loss function, have found great success in the\ndomain of visual representation learning. They are not suitable for exploiting\nthe rich dynamical structure of video however, as operations are done on many\naugmented instances. In this paper we propose \"Video Cross-Stream Prototypical\nContrasting\", a novel method which predicts consistent prototype assignments\nfrom both RGB and optical flow views, operating on sets of samples.\nSpecifically, we alternate the optimization process; while optimizing one of\nthe streams, all views are mapped to one set of stream prototype vectors. Each\nof the assignments is predicted with all views except the one matching the\nprediction, pushing representations closer to their assigned prototypes. As a\nresult, more efficient video embeddings with ingrained motion information are\nlearned, without the explicit need for optical flow computation during\ninference. We obtain state-of-the-art results on nearest neighbour video\nretrieval and action recognition, outperforming previous best by +3.2% on\nUCF101 using the S3D backbone (90.5% Top-1 acc), and by +7.2% on UCF101 and\n+15.1% on HMDB51 using the R(2+1)D backbone.",

          "description": "Despite the significant advances in deep learning over the past decade, a\nmajor challenge that limits the wide-spread adoption of deep learning has been\ntheir fragility to adversarial attacks. This sensitivity to making erroneous\npredictions in the presence of adversarially perturbed data makes deep neural\nnetworks difficult to adopt for certain real-world, mission-critical\napplications. While much of the research focus has revolved around adversarial\nexample creation and adversarial hardening, the area of performance measures\nfor assessing adversarial robustness is not well explored. Motivated by this,\nthis study presents the concept of residual error, a new performance measure\nfor not only assessing the adversarial robustness of a deep neural network at\nthe individual sample level, but also can be used to differentiate between\nadversarial and non-adversarial examples to facilitate for adversarial example\ndetection. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid model for approximating the\nresidual error in a tractable manner. Experimental results using the case of\nimage classification demonstrates the effectiveness and efficacy of the\nproposed residual error metric for assessing several well-known deep neural\nnetwork architectures. These results thus illustrate that the proposed measure\ncould be a useful tool for not only assessing the robustness of deep neural\nnetworks used in mission-critical scenarios, but also in the design of\nadversarially robust models.",

          "description": "Despite the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), their training\nsuffers from several well-known problems, including mode collapse and\ndifficulties learning a disconnected set of manifolds. In this paper, we break\ndown the challenging task of learning complex high dimensional distributions,\nsupporting diverse data samples, to simpler sub-tasks. Our solution relies on\ndesigning a partitioner that breaks the space into smaller regions, each having\na simpler distribution, and training a different generator for each partition.\nThis is done in an unsupervised manner without requiring any labels.\n\nWe formulate two desired criteria for the space partitioner that aid the\ntraining of our mixture of generators: 1) to produce connected partitions and\n2) provide a proxy of distance between partitions and data samples, along with\na direction for reducing that distance. These criteria are developed to avoid\nproducing samples from places with non-existent data density, and also\nfacilitate training by providing additional direction to the generators. We\ndevelop theoretical constraints for a space partitioner to satisfy the above\ncriteria. Guided by our theoretical analysis, we design an effective neural\narchitecture for the space partitioner that empirically assures these\nconditions. Experimental results on various standard benchmarks show that the\nproposed unsupervised model outperforms several recent methods.",

Specifically, we devise a new\nnetwork architecture with a shared encoder and several prediction heads, each\nof which predicts the distortion parameter of a specific distortion model. We\nfurther leverage a differentiable warping module to generate the rectified\nimages and re-distorted images from the distortion parameters and exploit the\nintra- and inter-model consistency between them during training, thereby\nleading to a self-supervised learning scheme without the need for ground-truth\ndistortion parameters or normal images. Experiments on synthetic dataset and\nreal-world fisheye images demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or\neven better performance than the supervised baseline method and representative\nstate-of-the-art methods.

          "description": "Traffic near-crash events serve as critical data sources for various smart\ntransportation applications, such as being surrogate safety measures for\ntraffic safety research and corner case data for automated vehicle testing.\nHowever, there are several key challenges for near-crash detection. First,\nextracting near-crashes from original data sources requires significant\ncomputing, communication, and storage resources. Also, existing methods lack\nefficiency and transferability, which bottlenecks prospective large-scale\napplications. To this end, this paper leverages the power of edge computing to\naddress these challenges by processing the video streams from existing dashcams\nonboard in a real-time manner. We design a multi-thread system architecture\nthat operates on edge devices and model the bounding boxes generated by object\ndetection and tracking in linear complexity. The method is insensitive to\ncamera parameters and backward compatible with different vehicles. The edge\ncomputing system has been evaluated with recorded videos and real-world tests\non two cars and four buses for over ten thousand hours. It filters out\nirrelevant videos in real-time thereby saving labor cost, processing time,\nnetwork bandwidth, and data storage. It collects not only event videos but also\nother valuable data such as road user type, event location, time to collision,\nvehicle trajectory, vehicle speed, brake switch, and throttle. The experiments\ndemonstrate the promising performance of the system regarding efficiency,\naccuracy, reliability, and transferability. It is among the first efforts in\napplying edge computing for real-time traffic video analytics and is expected\nto benefit multiple sub-fields in smart transportation research and\napplications.",

We present generative models that condition on the\ndependency tree of an utterance and generate a corresponding visual 3D feature\nmap as well as reason about its plausibility, and detector models that\ncondition on both the dependency tree of an utterance and a related image and\nlocalize the object referents in the 3D feature map inferred from the image.\nOur model outperforms models of language and vision that associate language\nwith 2D CNN activations or 2D images by a large margin in a variety of tasks,\nsuch as, classifying plausibility of utterances, detecting referential\nexpressions, and supplying rewards for trajectory optimization of object\nplacement policies from language instructions. We perform numerous ablations\nand show the improved performance of our detectors is due to its better\ngeneralization across camera viewpoints and lack of object interferences in the\ninferred 3D feature space, and the improved performance of our generators is\ndue to their ability to spatially reason about objects and their configurations\nin 3D when mapping from language to scenes.",

          "description": "Radars and cameras are mature, cost-effective, and robust sensors and have\nbeen widely used in the perception stack of mass-produced autonomous driving\nsystems. Due to their complementary properties, outputs from radar detection\n(radar pins) and camera perception (2D bounding boxes) are usually fused to\ngenerate the best perception results. The key to successful radar-camera fusion\nis the accurate data association. The challenges in the radar-camera\nassociation can be attributed to the complexity of driving scenes, the noisy\nand sparse nature of radar measurements, and the depth ambiguity from 2D\nbounding boxes. Traditional rule-based association methods are susceptible to\nperformance degradation in challenging scenarios and failure in corner cases.\nIn this study, we propose to address radar-camera association via deep\nrepresentation learning, to explore feature-level interaction and global\nreasoning. Additionally, we design a loss sampling mechanism and an innovative\nordinal loss to overcome the difficulty of imperfect labeling and to enforce\ncritical human-like reasoning. Despite being trained with noisy labels\ngenerated by a rule-based algorithm, our proposed method achieves a performance\nof 92.2% F1 score, which is 11.6% higher than the rule-based teacher. Moreover,\nthis data-driven method also lends itself to continuous improvement via corner\ncase mining.",

Fields over a base space are fundamental entities in both subjects, as\nare equivariant maps between these fields. In deep learning, however, these\nmaps are usually defined by convolutions with a kernel, whereas they are\npartial differential operators (PDOs) in physics. Developing the theory of\nequivariant PDOs in the context of deep learning could bring these subjects\neven closer together and lead to a stronger flow of ideas. In this work, we\nderive a $G$-steerability constraint that completely characterizes when a PDO\nbetween feature vector fields is equivariant, for arbitrary symmetry groups\n$G$. We then fully solve this constraint for several important groups. We use\nour solutions as equivariant drop-in replacements for convolutional layers and\nbenchmark them in that role. Finally, we develop a framework for equivariant\nmaps based on Schwartz distributions that unifies classical convolutions and\ndifferential operators and gives insight about the relation between the two.",

The success of subspace clustering depends on\nthe assumption that the data can be separated into different subspaces.\nHowever, this simple assumption does not always hold since the raw data might\nnot be separable into subspaces. To recover the ``clustering-friendly''\nrepresentation and facilitate the subsequent clustering, we propose a graph\nfiltering approach by which a smooth representation is achieved. Specifically,\nit injects graph similarity into data features by applying a low-pass filter to\nextract useful data representations for clustering. Extensive experiments on\nimage and document clustering datasets demonstrate that our method improves\nupon state-of-the-art subspace clustering techniques. Especially, its\ncomparable performance with deep learning methods emphasizes the effectiveness\nof the simple graph filtering scheme for many real-world applications.

          "description": "Pedestrian trajectory prediction in dynamic scenes remains a challenging and\ncritical problem in numerous applications, such as self-driving cars and\nsocially aware robots. Challenges concentrate on capturing pedestrians' motion\npatterns and social interactions, as well as handling the future uncertainties.\nRecent studies focus on modeling pedestrians' motion patterns with recurrent\nneural networks, capturing social interactions with pooling-based or\ngraph-based methods, and handling future uncertainties by using random Gaussian\nnoise as the latent variable. However, they do not integrate specific obstacle\navoidance experience (OAE) that may improve prediction performance. For\nexample, pedestrians' future trajectories are always influenced by others in\nfront. Here we propose GTPPO (Graph-based Trajectory Predictor with Pseudo\nOracle), an encoder-decoder-based method conditioned on pedestrians' future\nbehaviors. Pedestrians' motion patterns are encoded with a long short-term\nmemory unit, which introduces the temporal attention to highlight specific time\nsteps. Their interactions are captured by a graph-based attention mechanism,\nwhich draws OAE into the data-driven learning process of graph attention.\nFuture uncertainties are handled by generating multi-modal outputs with an\ninformative latent variable. Such a variable is generated by a novel pseudo\noracle predictor, which minimizes the knowledge gap between historical and\nground-truth trajectories. Finally, the GTPPO is evaluated on ETH, UCY and\nStanford Drone datasets, and the results demonstrate state-of-the-art\nperformance. Besides, the qualitative evaluations show successful cases of\nhandling sudden motion changes in the future. Such findings indicate that GTPPO\ncan peek into the future.",

Classic network\narchitectures (NAs) are generally worse than searched NAs in ST, which should\nbe the same in AT. In this paper, we argue that NA and AT cannot be handled\nindependently, since given a dataset, the optimal NA in ST would be no longer\noptimal in AT. That being said, AT is time-consuming itself; if we directly\nsearch NAs in AT over large search spaces, the computation will be practically\ninfeasible. Thus, we propose a diverse-structured network (DS-Net), to\nsignificantly reduce the size of the search space: instead of low-level\noperations, we only consider predefined atomic blocks, where an atomic block is\na time-tested building block like the residual block. There are only a few\natomic blocks and thus we can weight all atomic blocks rather than find the\nbest one in a searched block of DS-Net, which is an essential trade-off between\nexploring diverse structures and exploiting the best structures.

          "description": "Recently, autonomous vehicles and those equipped with an Advanced Driver\nAssistance System (ADAS) are emerging. They share the road with regular ones\noperated by human drivers entirely. To ensure guaranteed safety for passengers\nand other road users, it becomes essential for autonomous vehicles and ADAS to\nanticipate traffic accidents from natural driving scenes. The dynamic\nspatial-temporal interaction of the traffic agents is complex, and visual cues\nfor predicting a future accident are embedded deeply in dashcam video data.\nTherefore, early anticipation of traffic accidents remains a challenge. To this\nend, the paper presents a dynamic spatial-temporal attention (DSTA) network for\nearly anticipation of traffic accidents from dashcam videos. The proposed\nDSTA-network learns to select discriminative temporal segments of a video\nsequence with a module named Dynamic Temporal Attention (DTA). It also learns\nto focus on the informative spatial regions of frames with another module named\nDynamic Spatial Attention (DSA). The spatial-temporal relational features of\naccidents, along with scene appearance features, are learned jointly with a\nGated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network. The experimental evaluation of the\nDSTA-network on two benchmark datasets confirms that it has exceeded the\nstate-of-the-art performance. A thorough ablation study evaluates the\ncontributions of individual components of the DSTA-network, revealing how the\nnetwork achieves such performance. Furthermore, this paper proposes a new\nstrategy that fuses the prediction scores from two complementary models and\nverifies its effectiveness in further boosting the performance of early\naccident anticipation.",

Optimization-based approaches,\nlike the well-established Gerchberg-Saxton or the hybrid input output\nalgorithm, struggle at reconstructing images from magnitudes that are not\noversampled. This motivates the application of learned methods, which allow\nreconstruction from non-oversampled magnitude measurements after a learning\nphase. In this paper, we want to push the limits of these learned methods by\nmeans of a deep neural network cascade that reconstructs the image successively\non different resolutions from its non-oversampled Fourier magnitude.

          "description": "The determination of precise skin lesion boundaries in dermoscopic images\nusing automated methods faces many challenges, most importantly, the presence\nof hair, inconspicuous lesion edges and low contrast in dermoscopic images, and\nvariability in the color, texture and shapes of skin lesions. Existing deep\nlearning-based skin lesion segmentation algorithms are expensive in terms of\ncomputational time and memory. Consequently, running such segmentation\nalgorithms requires a powerful GPU and high bandwidth memory, which are not\navailable in dermoscopy devices. Thus, this article aims to achieve precise\nskin lesion segmentation with minimum resources: a lightweight, efficient\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) model called SLSNet, which combines 1-D\nkernel factorized networks, position and channel attention, and multiscale\naggregation mechanisms with a GAN model. The 1-D kernel factorized network\nreduces the computational cost of 2D filtering. The position and channel\nattention modules enhance the discriminative ability between the lesion and\nnon-lesion feature representations in spatial and channel dimensions,\nrespectively. A multiscale block is also used to aggregate the coarse-to-fine\nfeatures of input skin images and reduce the effect of the artifacts. SLSNet is\nevaluated on two publicly available datasets: ISBI 2017 and the ISIC 2018.\nAlthough SLSNet has only 2.35 million parameters, the experimental results\ndemonstrate that it achieves segmentation results on a par with the\nstate-of-the-art skin lesion segmentation methods with an accuracy of 97.61%,\nand Dice and Jaccard similarity coefficients of 90.63% and 81.98%,\nrespectively. SLSNet can run at more than 110 frames per second (FPS) in a\nsingle GTX1080Ti GPU, which is faster than well-known deep learning-based image\nsegmentation models, such as FCN. Therefore, SLSNet can be used for practical\ndermoscopic applications.",

However, in many scenarios the collection of paired\nnoise-noise images is still impractical. To bypass labeled images, Noise2Void\nmethods predict masked pixels from their surroundings with single noisy images\nonly and give improved denoising results that still need improvements. An\nobservation on classic denoising methods is that non-local mean (NLM) outcomes\nare typically superior to locally denoised results.

Here we propose Noise2Sim, an NLM-inspired self-learning method for\nimage denoising. Specifically, Noise2Sim leverages the self-similarity of image\npixels to train the denoising network, requiring single noisy images only. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that Noise2Sim tends to be equivalent to Noise2Noise\nunder mild conditions.

Unfortunately, the latter often relies on the\nability to enlist all possible transformations, which make such approaches\nlargely infeasible for infinite sets of transformations, such as arbitrary\nrotations or scaling. In this work, we propose a method for provably invariant\nnetwork architectures with respect to group actions by choosing one element\nfrom a (possibly continuous) orbit based on a fixed criterion. In a nutshell,\nwe intend to 'undo' any possible transformation before feeding the data into\nthe actual network. We analyze properties of such approaches, extend them to\nequivariant networks, and demonstrate their advantages in terms of robustness\nas well as computational efficiency in several numerical examples. In\nparticular, we investigate the robustness with respect to rotations of images\n(which can possibly hold up to discretization artifacts only) as well as the\nprovable rotational and scaling invariance of 3D point cloud classification.",

          "description": "When interacting with objects through cameras, or pictures, users often have\na specific intent. For example, they may want to perform a visual search.\nHowever, most object detection models ignore the user intent, relying on image\npixels as their only input. This often leads to incorrect results, such as lack\nof a high-confidence detection on the object of interest, or detection with a\nwrong class label. In this paper we investigate techniques to modulate standard\nobject detectors to explicitly account for the user intent, expressed as an\nembedding of a simple query. Compared to standard object detectors,\nquery-modulated detectors show superior performance at detecting objects for a\ngiven label of interest. Thanks to large-scale training data synthesized from\nstandard object detection annotations, query-modulated detectors can also\noutperform specialized referring expression recognition systems. Furthermore,\nthey can be simultaneously trained to solve for both query-modulated detection\nand standard object detection.",

          "description": "In real-world image enhancement, it is often challenging (if not impossible)\nto acquire ground-truth data, preventing the adoption of distance metrics for\nobjective quality assessment. As a result, one often resorts to subjective\nquality assessment, the most straightforward and reliable means of evaluating\nimage enhancement. Conventional subjective testing requires manually\npre-selecting a small set of visual examples, which may suffer from three\nsources of biases: 1) sampling bias due to the extremely sparse distribution of\nthe selected samples in the image space; 2) algorithmic bias due to potential\noverfitting the selected samples; 3) subjective bias due to further potential\ncherry-picking test results. This eventually makes the field of real-world\nimage enhancement more of an art than a science. Here we take steps towards\ndebiasing conventional subjective assessment by automatically sampling a set of\nadaptive and diverse images for subsequent testing. This is achieved by casting\nsample selection into a joint maximization of the discrepancy between the\nenhancers and the diversity among the selected input images. Careful visual\ninspection on the resulting enhanced images provides a debiased ranking of the\nenhancement algorithms. We demonstrate our subjective assessment method using\nthree popular and practically demanding image enhancement tasks: dehazing,\nsuper-resolution, and low-light enhancement.",

In this study, we present a case study incorporating the\nhighly accurate trajectories and movement classification obtained via VT-Lane\nfor the purpose of speed estimation and driver behavior calibration for traffic\nat urban intersections. First, we use a highly instrumented vehicle to verify\nthe estimated speeds obtained from video inference. The results of the speed\nvalidation show that our method can estimate the average travel speed of\ndetected vehicles in real-time with an error of 0.19 m/sec, which is equivalent\nto 2% of the average observed travel speeds in the intersection of the study.\nInstantaneous speeds (at the resolution of 30 Hz) were found to be estimated\nwith an average error of 0.21 m/sec and 0.86 m/sec respectively for\nfree-flowing and congested traffic conditions. We then use the estimated speeds\nto calibrate the parameters of a driver behavior model for the vehicles in the\narea of study. The results show that the calibrated model replicates the\ndriving behavior with an average error of 0.45 m/sec, indicating the high\npotential for using this framework for automated, large-scale calibration of\ncar-following models from roadside traffic video data, which can lead to\nsubstantial improvements in traffic modeling via microscopic simulation.",

Through learning in our game, diverse distracting behaviors of\nthe distractors naturally emerge, thereby exposing the tracker's weakness,\nwhich helps enhance the distraction-robustness of the tracker. For effective\nlearning, we then present a bunch of practical methods, including a reward\nfunction for distractors, a cross-modal teacher-student learning strategy, and\na recurrent attention mechanism for the tracker. The experimental results show\nthat our tracker performs desired distraction-robust active visual tracking and\ncan be well generalized to unseen environments.

          "description": "Pseudo-LiDAR based 3D object detectors have gained popularity due to their\nhigh accuracy. However, these methods need dense depth supervision and suffer\nfrom inferior speed. To solve these two issues, a recently introduced RTS3D\nbuilds an efficient 4D Feature-Consistency Embedding (FCE) space for the\nintermediate representation of object without depth supervision. FCE space\nsplits the entire object region into 3D uniform grid latent space for feature\nsampling point generation, which ignores the importance of different object\nregions. However, we argue that, compared with the inner region, the outer\nregion plays a more important role for accurate 3D detection. To encode more\ninformation from the outer region, we propose a shape prior non-uniform\nsampling strategy that performs dense sampling in outer region and sparse\nsampling in inner region. As a result, more points are sampled from the outer\nregion and more useful features are extracted for 3D detection. Further, to\nenhance the feature discrimination of each sampling point, we propose a\nhigh-level semantic enhanced FCE module to exploit more contextual information\nand suppress noise better. Experiments on the KITTI dataset are performed to\nshow the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the baseline\nRTS3D, our proposed method has 2.57% improvement on AP3d almost without extra\nnetwork parameters. Moreover, our proposed method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods without extra supervision at a real-time speed.",

In such systems, there is no data transfer from the end device to\na third-party information processing servers. The response time is vital to the\nuser experience of on-device document recognition. Combined with the\nunavailability of discrete GPUs, powerful CPUs, or a large RAM capacity on\nconsumer-grade end devices such as smartphones, the time limitations put\nsignificant constraints on the computational complexity of the applied\nalgorithms for on-device execution.\n\nIn this work, we consider document location in an image without prior\nknowledge of the document content or its internal structure. In accordance with\nthe published works, at least 5 systems offer solutions for on-device document\nlocation. All these systems use a location method which can be considered\nHough-based. The precision of such systems seems to be lower than that of the\nstate-of-the-art solutions which were not designed to account for the limited\ncomputational resources.\n\nWe propose an advanced Hough-based method. In contrast with other approaches,\nit accounts for the geometric invariants of the central projection model and\ncombines both edge and color features for document boundary detection. The\nproposed method allowed for the second best result for SmartDoc dataset in\nterms of precision, surpassed by U-net like neural network.

          "description": "We propose a novel GAN training scheme that can handle any level of labeling\nin a unified manner. Our scheme introduces a form of artificial labeling that\ncan incorporate manually defined labels, when available, and induce an\nalignment between them. To define the artificial labels, we exploit the\nassumption that neural network generators can be trained more easily to map\nnearby latent vectors to data with semantic similarities, than across separate\ncategories. We use generated data samples and their corresponding artificial\nconditioning labels to train a classifier. The classifier is then used to\nself-label real data. To boost the accuracy of the self-labeling, we also use\nthe exponential moving average of the classifier. However, because the\nclassifier might still make mistakes, especially at the beginning of the\ntraining, we also refine the labels through self-attention, by using the\nlabeling of real data samples only when the classifier outputs a high\nclassification probability score. We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10, STL-10\nand SVHN, and show that both self-labeling and self-attention consistently\nimprove the quality of generated data. More surprisingly, we find that the\nproposed scheme can even outperform class-conditional GANs.",

          "description": "Collecting training data from untrusted sources exposes machine learning\nservices to poisoning adversaries, who maliciously manipulate training data to\ndegrade the model accuracy. When trained on offline datasets, poisoning\nadversaries have to inject the poisoned data in advance before training, and\nthe order of feeding these poisoned batches into the model is stochastic. In\ncontrast, practical systems are more usually trained/fine-tuned on sequentially\ncaptured real-time data, in which case poisoning adversaries could dynamically\npoison each data batch according to the current model state. In this paper, we\nfocus on the real-time settings and propose a new attacking strategy, which\naffiliates an accumulative phase with poisoning attacks to secretly (i.e.,\nwithout affecting accuracy) magnify the destructive effect of a (poisoned)\ntrigger batch. By mimicking online learning and federated learning on CIFAR-10,\nwe show that the model accuracy will significantly drop by a single update step\non the trigger batch after the accumulative phase.

We have recently\ndemonstrated that reinforcement learning (RL) can classify 2D slices of MRI\nbrain images with high accuracy. Here we make two important steps toward\nspeeding image classification: Firstly, we automatically extract class labels\nfrom the clinical reports. Secondly, we extend our prior 2D classification work\nto fully 3D image volumes from our institution. Hence, we proceed as follows:\nin Part 1, we extract labels from reports automatically using the SBERT natural\nlanguage processing approach. Then, in Part 2, we use these labels with RL to\ntrain a classification Deep-Q Network (DQN) for 3D image volumes.\n\nMethods: For Part 1, we trained SBERT with 90 radiology report impressions.\nWe then used the trained SBERT to predict class labels for use in Part 2.

We tested on a separate set of 61 images, again using the classes\npredicted from patient reports by the trained SBERT in Part 1.

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are effective in solving many real-world\nproblems. Larger DNN models usually exhibit better quality (e.g., accuracy) but\ntheir excessive computation results in long training and inference time. Model\nsparsification can reduce the computation and memory cost while maintaining\nmodel quality. Most existing sparsification algorithms unidirectionally remove\nweights, while others randomly or greedily explore a small subset of weights in\neach layer. The inefficiency of the algorithms reduces the achievable sparsity\nlevel. In addition, many algorithms still require pre-trained dense models and\nthus suffer from large memory footprint and long training time. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel scheduled grow-and-prune (GaP) methodology without\npre-training the dense models. It addresses the shortcomings of the previous\nworks by repeatedly growing a subset of layers to dense and then pruning back\nto sparse after some training. Experiments have shown that such models can\nmatch or beat the quality of highly optimized dense models at 80% sparsity on a\nvariety of tasks, such as image classification, objective detection, 3D object\npart segmentation, and translation. They also outperform other state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) pruning methods, including pruning from pre-trained dense models. As an\nexample, a 90% sparse ResNet-50 obtained via GaP achieves 77.9% top-1 accuracy\non ImageNet, improving the SOTA results by 1.5%.",

          "description": "To evaluate clustering results is a significant part of cluster analysis.\nSince there are no true class labels for clustering in typical unsupervised\nlearning, many internal cluster validity indices (CVIs), which use predicted\nlabels and data, have been created. Without true labels, to design an effective\nCVI is as difficult as to create a clustering method. And it is crucial to have\nmore CVIs because there are no universal CVIs that can be used to measure all\ndatasets and no specific methods of selecting a proper CVI for clusters without\ntrue labels. Therefore, to apply a variety of CVIs to evaluate clustering\nresults is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel internal CVI -- the\nDistance-based Separability Index (DSI), based on a data separability measure.\nWe compared the DSI with eight internal CVIs including studies from early Dunn\n(1974) to most recent CVDD (2019) and an external CVI as ground truth, by using\nclustering results of five clustering algorithms on 12 real and 97 synthetic\ndatasets. Results show DSI is an effective, unique, and competitive CVI to\nother compared CVIs. We also summarized the general process to evaluate CVIs\nand created the rank-difference metric for comparison of CVIs' results.",

Further, salient features of the synthetic\nCOVID-19 images indicate that the distribution is significantly different from\nNon-COVID-19 classes, enabling a proper decision boundary.

          "description": "Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the most common symptom displayed by\npatients has been a fever, leading to the use of temperature scanning as a\npreemptive measure to detect potential carriers of the virus. Human employees\nwith handheld thermometers have been used to fulfill this task, however this\nputs them at risk as they cannot be physically distanced and the sequential\nnature of this method leads to great inconveniences and inefficiency. The\nproposed solution is an autonomously navigating robot capable of conversing and\nscanning people's temperature to detect fevers and help screen for COVID-19. To\nsatisfy this objective, the robot must be able to (1) navigate autonomously,\n(2) detect and track people, and (3) get individuals' temperature reading and\nconverse with them if it exceeds 38{\\deg}C. An autonomously navigating mobile\nrobot is used with a manipulator controlled using a face tracking algorithm,\nand an end effector consisting of a thermal camera, smartphone, and chatbot.\nThe goal is to develop a functioning solution that performs the above tasks. In\naddition, technical challenges encountered and their engineering solutions will\nbe presented, and recommendations will be made for enhancements that could be\nincorporated when approaching commercialization.",

          "description": "Robust multi-agent trajectory prediction is essential for the safe control of\nrobots and vehicles that interact with humans. Many existing methods treat\nsocial and temporal information separately and therefore fall short of\nmodelling the joint future trajectories of all agents in a socially consistent\nway. To address this, we propose a new class of Latent Variable Sequential Set\nTransformers which autoregressively model multi-agent trajectories. We refer to\nthese architectures as \"AutoBots\". AutoBots model the contents of sets (e.g.\nrepresenting the properties of agents in a scene) over time and employ\nmulti-head self-attention blocks over these sequences of sets to encode the\nsociotemporal relationships between the different actors of a scene. This\nproduces either the trajectory of one ego-agent or a distribution over the\nfuture trajectories for all agents under consideration. Our approach works for\ngeneral sequences of sets and we provide illustrative experiments modelling the\nsequential structure of the multiple strokes that make up symbols in the\nOmniglot data. For the single-agent prediction case, we validate our model on\nthe NuScenes motion prediction task and achieve competitive results on the\nglobal leaderboard. In the multi-agent forecasting setting, we validate our\nmodel on TrajNet. We find that our method outperforms physical extrapolation\nand recurrent network baselines and generates scene-consistent trajectories.",

Two main contexts are identified,\noriginated respectively from the descriptor space and from the keypoint space.\nThe former is generally used to design the actual matching strategy while the\nlatter to filter matches according to the local spatial consistency. On this\nbasis, a new matching strategy and a novel local spatial filter, named\nrespectively blob matching and Delaunay Triangulation Matching (DTM) are\ndevised. Blob matching provides a general matching framework by merging\ntogether several strategies, including pre-filtering as well as many-to-many\nand symmetric matching, enabling to achieve a global improvement upon each\nindividual strategy. DTM alternates between Delaunay triangulation contractions\nand expansions to figure out and adjust keypoint neighborhood consistency.\nExperimental evaluation shows that DTM is comparable or better than the\nstate-of-the-art in terms of matching accuracy and robustness, especially for\nnon-planar scenes. Evaluation is carried out according to a new benchmark\ndevised for analyzing the matching pipeline in terms of correct correspondences\non both planar and non-planar scenes, including state-of-the-art methods as\nwell as the common SIFT matching approach for reference.

          "description": "Multiple views of data, both naturally acquired (e.g., image and audio) and\nartificially produced (e.g., via adding different noise to data samples), have\nproven useful in enhancing representation learning. Natural views are often\nhandled by multiview analysis tools, e.g., (deep) canonical correlation\nanalysis [(D)CCA], while the artificial ones are frequently used in\nself-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms, e.g., SimCLR and Barlow Twins. Both\ntypes of approaches often involve learning neural feature extractors such that\nthe embeddings of data exhibit high cross-view correlations. Although\nintuitive, the effectiveness of correlation-based neural embedding is only\nempirically validated. This work puts forth a theory-backed framework for\nunsupervised multiview learning. Our development starts with proposing a\nmultiview model, where each view is a nonlinear mixture of shared and private\ncomponents. Consequently, the learning problem boils down to shared/private\ncomponent identification and disentanglement. Under this model, latent\ncorrelation maximization is shown to guarantee the extraction of the shared\ncomponents across views (up to certain ambiguities). In addition, the private\ninformation in each view can be provably disentangled from the shared using\nproper regularization design. The method is tested on a series of tasks, e.g.,\ndownstream clustering, which all show promising performance.

Most\nexisting adversarial attack methods achieve nearly 100% attack success rates\nunder the white-box setting, but only achieve relatively low attack success\nrates under the black-box setting. To improve the transferability of\nadversarial examples for the black-box setting, several methods have been\nproposed, e.g., input diversity, translation-invariant attack, and\nmomentum-based attack. In this paper, we propose a method named Gradient\nRefining, which can further improve the adversarial transferability by\ncorrecting useless gradients introduced by input diversity through multiple\ntransformations. Our method is generally applicable to many gradient-based\nattack methods combined with input diversity.

Observing that most self-supervised methods\noptimize similarity metrics between a set of model components, we propose a\ntaxonomy of all reasonable ways to organize this process. We first evaluate\nmodels on toy multimodal MNIST datasets and then apply them to a multimodal\nneuroimaging dataset with Alzheimer's disease patients. We find that (1)\nmultimodal contrastive learning has significant benefits over its unimodal\ncounterpart, (2) the specific composition of multiple contrastive objectives is\ncritical to performance on a downstream task, (3) maximization of the\nsimilarity between representations has a regularizing effect on a neural\nnetwork, which can sometimes lead to reduced downstream performance but still\nreveal multimodal relations. Results show that the proposed approach\noutperforms previous self-supervised encoder-decoder methods based on canonical\ncorrelation analysis (CCA) or the mixture-of-experts multimodal variational\nautoEncoder (MMVAE) on various datasets with a linear evaluation protocol.\nImportantly, we find a promising solution to uncover connections between\nmodalities through a jointly shared subspace that can help advance work in our\nsearch for neuroimaging biomarkers.",

          "description": "This paper proposes a framework for the interactive video object segmentation\n(VOS) in the wild where users can choose some frames for annotations\niteratively. Then, based on the user annotations, a segmentation algorithm\nrefines the masks. The previous interactive VOS paradigm selects the frame with\nsome worst evaluation metric, and the ground truth is required for calculating\nthe evaluation metric, which is impractical in the testing phase. In contrast,\nin this paper, we advocate that the frame with the worst evaluation metric may\nnot be exactly the most valuable frame that leads to the most performance\nimprovement across the video. Thus, we formulate the frame selection problem in\nthe interactive VOS as a Markov Decision Process, where an agent is learned to\nrecommend the frame under a deep reinforcement learning framework. The learned\nagent can automatically determine the most valuable frame, making the\ninteractive setting more practical in the wild. Experimental results on the\npublic datasets show the effectiveness of our learned agent without any changes\nto the underlying VOS algorithms.

Our study illustrates the outstanding design of\nALPR with four insights: (1) the resampling-based cascaded framework is\nbeneficial to both speed and accuracy; (2) the highly efficient license plate\nrecognition should abundant additional character segmentation and recurrent\nneural network (RNN), but adopt a plain convolutional neural network (CNN); (3)\nin the case of CNN, taking advantage of vertex information on license plates\nimproves the recognition performance; and (4) the weight-sharing character\nclassifier addresses the lack of training images in small-scale datasets. Based\non these insights, we propose a novel ALPR approach, termed VSNet.\nSpecifically, VSNet includes two CNNs, i.e., VertexNet for license plate\ndetection and SCR-Net for license plate recognition, integrated in a\nresampling-based cascaded manner. In VertexNet, we propose an efficient\nintegration block to extract the spatial features of license plates. With\nvertex supervisory information, we propose a vertex-estimation branch in\nVertexNet such that license plates can be rectified as the input images of\nSCR-Net. In SCR-Net, we introduce a horizontal encoding technique for\nleft-to-right feature extraction and propose a weight-sharing classifier for\ncharacter recognition. Experimental results show that the proposed VSNet\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods by more than 50% relative improvement on\nerror rate, achieving > 99% recognition accuracy on CCPD and AOLP datasets with\n149 FPS inference speed.

Applications range from\nrepresentation learning, image translation and generative modeling, to the\nestimation of spatial deformations. Such maps relate feature vectors, or map\nbetween feature spaces. Well-behaved maps should be regular, which can be\nimposed explicitly or may emanate from the data itself. We explore what induces\nregularity for spatial transformations, e.g., when computing image\nregistrations. Classical optimization-based models compute maps between pairs\nof samples and rely on an appropriate regularizer for well-posedness. Recent\ndeep learning approaches have attempted to avoid using such regularizers\naltogether by relying on the sample population instead. We explore if it is\npossible to obtain spatial regularity using an inverse consistency loss only\nand elucidate what explains map regularity in such a context. We find that deep\nnetworks combined with an inverse consistency loss and randomized off-grid\ninterpolation yield well behaved, approximately diffeomorphic, spatial\ntransformations.

They also offer an\neffective solution in healthcare for bi-directional protection against\nair-borne diseases. Wearing and positioning the mask correctly is essential for\nits function. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer an excellent solution\nfor face recognition and classification of correct mask wearing and\npositioning. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, such algorithms\ncan be used at entrances to corporate buildings, airports, shopping areas, and\nother indoor locations, to mitigate the spread of the virus. These application\nscenarios impose major challenges to the underlying compute platform. The\ninference hardware must be cheap, small and energy efficient, while providing\nsufficient memory and compute power to execute accurate CNNs at a reasonably\nlow latency. To maintain data privacy of the public, all processing must remain\non the edge-device, without any communication with cloud servers. To address\nthese challenges, we present a low-power binary neural network classifier for\ncorrect facial-mask wear and positioning. The classification task is\nimplemented on an embedded FPGA, performing high-throughput binary operations.\nClassification can take place at up to ~6400 frames-per-second, easily enabling\nmulti-camera, speed-gate settings or statistics collection in crowd settings.\nWhen deployed on a single entrance or gate, the idle power consumption is\nreduced to 1.6W, improving the battery-life of the device. We achieve an\naccuracy of up to 98% for four wearing positions of the MaskedFace-Net dataset.\nTo maintain equivalent classification accuracy for all face structures,\nskin-tones, hair types, and mask types, the algorithms are tested for their\nability to generalize the relevant features over all subjects using the\nGrad-CAM approach.",

          "description": "Following their success in natural language processing, transformers have\nrecently shown much promise for computer vision. The self-attention operation\nunderlying transformers yields global interactions between all tokens ,i.e.\nwords or image patches, and enables flexible modelling of image data beyond the\nlocal interactions of convolutions. This flexibility, however, comes with a\nquadratic complexity in time and memory, hindering application to long\nsequences and high-resolution images. We propose a \"transposed\" version of\nself-attention that operates across feature channels rather than tokens, where\nthe interactions are based on the cross-covariance matrix between keys and\nqueries. The resulting cross-covariance attention (XCA) has linear complexity\nin the number of tokens, and allows efficient processing of high-resolution\nimages. Our cross-covariance image transformer (XCiT) is built upon XCA. It\ncombines the accuracy of conventional transformers with the scalability of\nconvolutional architectures.

          "description": "Adversarial attacks are considered a potentially serious security threat for\nmachine learning systems. Medical image analysis (MedIA) systems have recently\nbeen argued to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to strong financial\nincentives and the associated technological infrastructure.\n\nIn this paper, we study previously unexplored factors affecting adversarial\nattack vulnerability of deep learning MedIA systems in three medical domains:\nophthalmology, radiology, and pathology. We focus on adversarial black-box\nsettings, in which the attacker does not have full access to the target model\nand usually uses another model, commonly referred to as surrogate model, to\ncraft adversarial examples. We consider this to be the most realistic scenario\nfor MedIA systems.\n\nFirstly, we study the effect of weight initialization (ImageNet vs. random)\non the transferability of adversarial attacks from the surrogate model to the\ntarget model. Secondly, we study the influence of differences in development\ndata between target and surrogate models. We further study the interaction of\nweight initialization and data differences with differences in model\narchitecture. All experiments were done with a perturbation degree tuned to\nensure maximal transferability at minimal visual perceptibility of the attacks.\n\nOur experiments show that pre-training may dramatically increase the\ntransferability of adversarial examples, even when the target and surrogate's\narchitectures are different: the larger the performance gain using\npre-training, the larger the transferability. Differences in the development\ndata between target and surrogate models considerably decrease the performance\nof the attack; this decrease is further amplified by difference in the model\narchitecture. We believe these factors should be considered when developing\nsecurity-critical MedIA systems planned to be deployed in clinical practice.",

          "description": "Dynamic Contrast Enhanced-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) is widely used\nto complement ultrasound examinations and x-ray mammography during the early\ndetection and diagnosis of breast cancer. However, images generated by various\nMRI scanners (e.g. GE Healthcare vs Siemens) differ both in intensity and noise\ndistribution, preventing algorithms trained on MRIs from one scanner to\ngeneralize to data from other scanners successfully. We propose a method for\nimage normalization to solve this problem. MRI normalization is challenging\nbecause it requires both normalizing intensity values and mapping between the\nnoise distributions of different scanners. We utilize a cycle-consistent\ngenerative adversarial network to learn a bidirectional mapping between MRIs\nproduced by GE Healthcare and Siemens scanners. This allows us learning the\nmapping between two different scanner types without matched data, which is not\ncommonly available. To ensure the preservation of breast shape and structures\nwithin the breast, we propose two technical innovations. First, we incorporate\na mutual information loss with the CycleGAN architecture to ensure that the\nstructure of the breast is maintained. Second, we propose a modified\ndiscriminator architecture which utilizes a smaller field-of-view to ensure the\npreservation of finer details in the breast tissue. Quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations show that the second proposed method was able to\nconsistently preserve a high level of detail in the breast structure while also\nperforming the proper intensity normalization and noise mapping. Our results\ndemonstrate that the proposed model can successfully learn a bidirectional\nmapping between MRIs produced by different vendors, potentially enabling\nimproved accuracy of downstream computational algorithms for diagnosis and\ndetection of breast cancer. All the data used in this study are publicly\navailable.",

Fully automatic natural image matting without\nexternal annotation is quite challenging. Well-performed matting methods\nusually require accurate labor-intensive handcrafted trimap as extra input,\nwhile the performance of automatic trimap generation method of dilating\nforeground segmentation fluctuates with segmentation quality. Therefore, we\nargue that how to handle trade-off of additional information input is a major\nissue in automatic matting. This paper presents a universal semantic-guided\nautomatic natural image matting pipeline with light-weight non-local attention\nwithout trimap and background image as input. Specifically, guided by semantic\ninformation of coarse foreground segmentation, Trimap Generation Network\nestimates accurate trimap. With estimated trimap and RGB image as input, our\nlight-weight Non-local Matting Network with Refinement produces final alpha\nmatte, whose trimap-guided global aggregation attention block is equipped with\nstride downsampling convolution, reducing computation complexity and promoting\nperformance.

The most successful approaches\nto alleviate this forgetting require extensive replay of previously seen data,\nwhich is problematic when memory constraints or data legality concerns exist.\nIn this work, we consider the high-impact problem of Data-Free\nClass-Incremental Learning (DFCIL), where an incremental learning agent must\nlearn new concepts over time without storing generators or training data from\npast tasks. One approach for DFCIL is to replay synthetic images produced by\ninverting a frozen copy of the learner's classification model, but we show this\napproach fails for common class-incremental benchmarks when using standard\ndistillation strategies. We diagnose the cause of this failure and propose a\nnovel incremental distillation strategy for DFCIL, contributing a modified\ncross-entropy training and importance-weighted feature distillation, and show\nthat our method results in up to a 25.1% increase in final task accuracy\n(absolute difference) compared to SOTA DFCIL methods for common\nclass-incremental benchmarks.

For efficiency,\nwe advocate for these cameras to be zero streaming: capturing videos to local\nstorage and communicating with the cloud only when analytics is requested. How\nto query zero-streaming cameras efficiently? Our response is a camera/cloud\nruntime system called DIVA. It addresses two key challenges: to best use\nlimited camera resource during video capture; to rapidly explore massive videos\nduring query execution. DIVA contributes two unconventional techniques. (1)\nWhen capturing videos, a camera builds sparse yet accurate landmark frames,\nfrom which it learns reliable knowledge for accelerating future queries. (2)\nWhen executing a query, a camera processes frames in multiple passes with\nincreasingly more expensive operators. As such, DIVA presents and keeps\nrefining inexact query results throughout the query's execution. On diverse\nqueries over 15 videos lasting 720 hours in total, DIVA runs at more than 100x\nvideo realtime and outperforms competitive alternative designs.

          "description": "Understanding the semantics of human movement -- the what, how and why of the\nmovement -- is an important problem that requires datasets of human actions\nwith semantic labels. Existing datasets take one of two approaches. Large-scale\nvideo datasets contain many action labels but do not contain ground-truth 3D\nhuman motion. Alternatively, motion-capture (mocap) datasets have precise body\nmotions but are limited to a small number of actions. To address this, we\npresent BABEL, a large dataset with language labels describing the actions\nbeing performed in mocap sequences. BABEL consists of action labels for about\n43 hours of mocap sequences from AMASS. Action labels are at two levels of\nabstraction -- sequence labels describe the overall action in the sequence, and\nframe labels describe all actions in every frame of the sequence. Each frame\nlabel is precisely aligned with the duration of the corresponding action in the\nmocap sequence, and multiple actions can overlap. There are over 28k sequence\nlabels, and 63k frame labels in BABEL, which belong to over 250 unique action\ncategories. Labels from BABEL can be leveraged for tasks like action\nrecognition, temporal action localization, motion synthesis, etc. To\ndemonstrate the value of BABEL as a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of\nmodels on 3D action recognition. We demonstrate that BABEL poses interesting\nlearning challenges that are applicable to real-world scenarios, and can serve\nas a useful benchmark of progress in 3D action recognition.

          "description": "Given a pair of partially overlapping source and target images and a keypoint\nin the source image, the keypoint's correspondent in the target image can be\neither visible, occluded or outside the field of view. Local feature matching\nmethods are only able to identify the correspondent's location when it is\nvisible, while humans can also hallucinate its location when it is occluded or\noutside the field of view through geometric reasoning. In this paper, we bridge\nthis gap by training a network to output a peaked probability distribution over\nthe correspondent's location, regardless of this correspondent being visible,\noccluded, or outside the field of view. We experimentally demonstrate that this\nnetwork is indeed able to hallucinate correspondences on unseen pairs of\nimages. We also apply this network to a camera pose estimation problem and find\nit is significantly more robust than state-of-the-art local feature\nmatching-based competitors.",

          "description": "Predicting all applicable labels for a given image is known as multi-label\nclassification. Compared to the standard multi-class case (where each image has\nonly one label), it is considerably more challenging to annotate training data\nfor multi-label classification. When the number of potential labels is large,\nhuman annotators find it difficult to mention all applicable labels for each\ntraining image. Furthermore, in some settings detection is intrinsically\ndifficult e.g. finding small object instances in high resolution images. As a\nresult, multi-label training data is often plagued by false negatives. We\nconsider the hardest version of this problem, where annotators provide only one\nrelevant label for each image. As a result, training sets will have only one\npositive label per image and no confirmed negatives. We explore this special\ncase of learning from missing labels across four different multi-label image\nclassification datasets for both linear classifiers and end-to-end fine-tuned\ndeep networks. We extend existing multi-label losses to this setting and\npropose novel variants that constrain the number of expected positive labels\nduring training. Surprisingly, we show that in some cases it is possible to\napproach the performance of fully labeled classifiers despite training with\nsignificantly fewer confirmed labels.",

          "description": "Over the past several years, we have witnessed impressive progress in the\nfield of learned image compression. Recent learned image codecs are commonly\nbased on autoencoders, that first encode an image into low-dimensional latent\nrepresentations and then decode them for reconstruction purposes. To capture\nspatial dependencies in the latent space, prior works exploit hyperprior and\nspatial context model to build an entropy model, which estimates the bit-rate\nfor end-to-end rate-distortion optimization. However, such an entropy model is\nsuboptimal from two aspects: (1) It fails to capture spatially global\ncorrelations among the latents. (2) Cross-channel relationships of the latents\nare still underexplored. In this paper, we propose the concept of separate\nentropy coding to leverage a serial decoding process for causal contextual\nentropy prediction in the latent space. A causal context model is proposed that\nseparates the latents across channels and makes use of cross-channel\nrelationships to generate highly informative contexts. Furthermore, we propose\na causal global prediction model, which is able to find global reference points\nfor accurate predictions of unknown points. Both these two models facilitate\nentropy estimation without the transmission of overhead. In addition, we\nfurther adopt a new separate attention module to build more powerful transform\nnetworks. Experimental results demonstrate that our full image compression\nmodel outperforms standard VVC/H.266 codec on Kodak dataset in terms of both\nPSNR and MS-SSIM, yielding the state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance.",

          "description": "Dexterous robotic hands are appealing for their agility and human-like\nmorphology, yet their high degree of freedom makes learning to manipulate\nchallenging. We introduce an approach for learning dexterous grasping. Our key\nidea is to embed an object-centric visual affordance model within a deep\nreinforcement learning loop to learn grasping policies that favor the same\nobject regions favored by people. Unlike traditional approaches that learn from\nhuman demonstration trajectories (e.g., hand joint sequences captured with a\nglove), the proposed prior is object-centric and image-based, allowing the\nagent to anticipate useful affordance regions for objects unseen during policy\nlearning. We demonstrate our idea with a 30-DoF five-fingered robotic hand\nsimulator on 40 objects from two datasets, where it successfully and\nefficiently learns policies for stable functional grasps. Our affordance-guided\npolicies are significantly more effective, generalize better to novel objects,\ntrain 3 X faster than the baselines, and are more robust to noisy sensor\nreadings and actuation. Our work offers a step towards manipulation agents that\nlearn by watching how people use objects, without requiring state and action\ninformation about the human body.

          "description": "Deep neural models in recent years have been successful in almost every\nfield, including extremely complex problem statements. However, these models\nare huge in size, with millions (and even billions) of parameters, thus\ndemanding more heavy computation power and failing to be deployed on edge\ndevices. Besides, the performance boost is highly dependent on redundant\nlabeled data. To achieve faster speeds and to handle the problems caused by the\nlack of data, knowledge distillation (KD) has been proposed to transfer\ninformation learned from one model to another. KD is often characterized by the\nso-called `Student-Teacher' (S-T) learning framework and has been broadly\napplied in model compression and knowledge transfer. This paper is about KD and\nS-T learning, which are being actively studied in recent years. First, we aim\nto provide explanations of what KD is and how/why it works. Then, we provide a\ncomprehensive survey on the recent progress of KD methods together with S-T\nframeworks typically for vision tasks. In general, we consider some fundamental\nquestions that have been driving this research area and thoroughly generalize\nthe research progress and technical details.

With the popularization of commercial light field (LF) cameras,\ncapturing LF images (LFIs) is as convenient as taking regular photos, and\ngeometry information can be reliably inferred. This inspires us to use a sparse\nset of LF captures to render high-quality novel views globally.

To overcome this challenge,\nwe propose a novel scale-consistent volume rescaling algorithm that robustly\naligns the disparity probability volumes (DPV) among different captures for\nscale-consistent global geometry fusion. Based on the fused DPV projected to\nthe target camera frustum, novel learning-based modules have been proposed\n(i.e., the attention-guided multi-scale residual fusion module, and the\ndisparity field guided deep re-regularization module) which comprehensively\nregularize noisy observations from heterogeneous captures for high-quality\nrendering of novel LFIs.

Using standard\ntraining on the base classes, without resorting to complex meta-learning and\nepisodic-training strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art\nfew-shot methods by significant margins, across various models, settings and\ndata sets. Surprisingly, we found that even standard clustering procedures\n(e.g., K-means), which correspond to particular, non-regularized cases of our\ngeneral model, already achieve competitive performances in comparison to the\nstate-of-the-art in few-shot learning. These surprising results point to the\nlimitations of the current few-shot benchmarks, and question the viability of a\nlarge body of convoluted few-shot learning techniques in the recent literature.",

For the panoptic\nunderstanding of dynamic scenes, we further extend this concept to every\nsegment.

To validate our proposals, we adopt a deep siamese model\nand train the model to learn the temporal correspondence on two different\nlevels (i.e., segment and pixel) along with the target task.

We show that our per-frame inference model can achieve new\nstate-of-the-art results on Cityscapes-VPS and VIPER datasets.

Fast and accurate segmentation\non the organ in these images is crucial to planning and fusion with other\nmodalities such as magnetic resonance images (MRIs) .

          "description": "Instance segmentation has witnessed a remarkable progress on class-balanced\nbenchmarks. However, they fail to perform as accurately in real-world\nscenarios, where the category distribution of objects naturally comes with a\nlong tail. Instances of head classes dominate a long-tailed dataset and they\nserve as negative samples of tail categories. The overwhelming gradients of\nnegative samples on tail classes lead to a biased learning process for\nclassifiers. Consequently, objects of tail categories are more likely to be\nmisclassified as backgrounds or head categories. To tackle this problem, we\npropose Seesaw Loss to dynamically re-balance gradients of positive and\nnegative samples for each category, with two complementary factors, i.e.,\nmitigation factor and compensation factor. The mitigation factor reduces\npunishments to tail categories w.r.t. the ratio of cumulative training\ninstances between different categories. Meanwhile, the compensation factor\nincreases the penalty of misclassified instances to avoid false positives of\ntail categories. We conduct extensive experiments on Seesaw Loss with\nmainstream frameworks and different data sampling strategies.

The dynamic range\nof well-exposed areas must be expanded and any missing information due to\nover/under-exposure must be recovered (hallucinated). The majority of methods\nfocus on the former and are relatively successful, while most attempts on the\nlatter are not of sufficient quality, even ones based on Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs).

This work\npresents a GAN-based method that hallucinates missing information from badly\nexposed areas in LDR images and compares its efficacy with alternative\nvariations. The proposed method is quantitatively competitive with\nstate-of-the-art inverse tone mapping methods, providing good dynamic range\nexpansion for well-exposed areas and plausible hallucinations for saturated and\nunder-exposed areas.

In this\npaper, we introduce a large-scale in-the-wild visual attribute prediction\ndataset consisting of over 927K attribute annotations for over 260K object\ninstances. Formally, object attribute prediction is a multi-label\nclassification problem where all attributes that apply to an object must be\npredicted. Our dataset poses significant challenges to existing methods due to\nlarge number of attributes, label sparsity, data imbalance, and object\nocclusion. To this end, we propose several techniques that systematically\ntackle these challenges, including a base model that utilizes both low- and\nhigh-level CNN features with multi-hop attention, reweighting and resampling\ntechniques, a novel negative label expansion scheme, and a novel supervised\nattribute-aware contrastive learning algorithm.

          "description": "Classical machine learning frameworks assume access to a possibly large\ndataset in order to train a predictive model. In many practical applications\nhowever, data does not arrive all at once, but in batches over time. This\ncreates a natural trade-off between accuracy of a model and time to obtain such\na model. A greedy predictor could produce non-trivial predictions by\nimmediately training on batches as soon as these become available but, it may\nalso make sub-optimal use of future data. On the other hand, a tardy predictor\ncould wait for a long time to aggregate several batches into a larger dataset,\nbut ultimately deliver a much better performance. In this work, we consider\nsuch a streaming learning setting, which we dub {\\em anytime learning at\nmacroscale} (ALMA). It is an instance of anytime learning applied not at the\nlevel of a single chunk of data, but at the level of the entire sequence of\nlarge batches. We first formalize this learning setting, we then introduce\nmetrics to assess how well learners perform on the given task for a given\nmemory and compute budget, and finally we test several baseline approaches on\nstandard benchmarks repurposed for anytime learning at macroscale. The general\nfinding is that bigger models always generalize better. In particular, it is\nimportant to grow model capacity over time if the initial model is relatively\nsmall.

          "description": "Adversarial training is the de facto most promising defense against\nadversarial examples. Yet, its passive nature inevitably prevents it from being\nimmune to unknown attackers. To achieve a proactive defense, we need a more\nfundamental understanding of adversarial examples, beyond the popular bounded\nthreat model. In this paper, we provide a causal viewpoint of adversarial\nvulnerability: the cause is the confounder ubiquitously existing in learning,\nwhere attackers are precisely exploiting the confounding effect. Therefore, a\nfundamental solution for adversarial robustness is causal intervention. As the\nconfounder is unobserved in general, we propose to use the instrumental\nvariable that achieves intervention without the need for confounder\nobservation. We term our robust training method as Causal intervention by\ninstrumental Variable (CiiV). It has a differentiable retinotopic sampling\nlayer and a consistency loss, which is stable and guaranteed not to suffer from\ngradient obfuscation.

          "description": "3D face reconstruction from a single image is challenging due to its\nill-posed nature. Model-based face autoencoders address this issue effectively\nby fitting a face model to the target image in a weakly supervised manner.\nHowever, in unconstrained environments occlusions distort the face\nreconstruction because the model often erroneously tries to adapt to occluded\nface regions. Supervised occlusion segmentation is a viable solution to avoid\nthe fitting of occluded face regions, but it requires a large amount of\nannotated training data. In this work, we enable model-based face autoencoders\nto segment occluders accurately without requiring any additional supervision\nduring training, and this separates regions where the model will be fitted from\nthose where it will not be fitted. To achieve this, we extend face autoencoders\nwith a segmentation network. The segmentation network decides which regions the\nmodel should adapt to by reaching balances in a trade-off between including\npixels and adapting the model to them, and excluding pixels so that the model\nfitting is not negatively affected and reaches higher overall reconstruction\naccuracy on pixels showing the face. This leads to a synergistic effect, in\nwhich the occlusion segmentation guides the training of the face autoencoder to\nconstrain the fitting in the non-occluded regions, while the improved fitting\nenables the segmentation model to better predict the occluded face regions.\nQualitative and quantitative experiments on the CelebA-HQ database and the AR\ndatabase verify the effectiveness of our model in improving 3D face\nreconstruction under occlusions and in enabling accurate occlusion segmentation\nfrom weak supervision only.

          "description": "Deep networks have been progressively adapted to new sensor modalities,\nnamely to 3D LiDAR, which led to unprecedented achievements in autonomous\nvehicle-related applications such as place recognition. One of the main\nchallenges of deep models in place recognition is to extract efficient and\ndescriptive feature representations that relate places based on their\nsimilarity. To address the problem of place recognition using LiDAR data, this\npaper proposes a novel 3D LiDAR-based deep learning network (named AttDLNet)\nthat comprises an encoder network and exploits an attention mechanism to\nselectively focus on long-range context and interfeature relationships. The\nproposed network is trained and validated on the KITTI dataset, using the\ncosine loss for training and a retrieval-based place recognition pipeline for\nvalidation. Additionally, an ablation study is presented to assess the best\nnetwork configuration. Results show that the encoder network features are\nalready very descriptive, but adding attention to the network further improves\nperformance. From the ablation study, results indicate that the middle encoder\nlayers have the highest mean performance, while deeper layers are more robust\nto orientation change.

          "description": "The joint use of multiple imaging modalities for medical image segmentation\nhas been widely studied in recent years. The fusion of information from\ndifferent modalities has demonstrated to improve the segmentation accuracy,\nwith respect to mono-modal segmentations, in several applications. However,\nacquiring multiple modalities is usually not possible in a clinical setting due\nto a limited number of physicians and scanners, and to limit costs and scan\ntime. Most of the time, only one modality is acquired. In this paper, we\npropose KD-Net, a framework to transfer knowledge from a trained multi-modal\nnetwork (teacher) to a mono-modal one (student). The proposed method is an\nadaptation of the generalized distillation framework where the student network\nis trained on a subset (1 modality) of the teacher's inputs (n modalities). We\nillustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in brain tumor\nsegmentation with the BraTS 2018 dataset. Using different architectures, we\nshow that the student network effectively learns from the teacher and always\noutperforms the baseline mono-modal network in terms of segmentation accuracy.",

          "description": "The task of unsupervised motion retargeting in videos has seen substantial\nadvancements through the use of deep neural networks. While early works\nconcentrated on specific object priors such as a human face or body, recent\nwork considered the unsupervised case. When the source and target videos,\nhowever, are of different shapes, current methods fail. To alleviate this\nproblem, we introduce JOKR - a JOint Keypoint Representation that captures the\nmotion common to both the source and target videos, without requiring any\nobject prior or data collection. By employing a domain confusion term, we\nenforce the unsupervised keypoint representations of both videos to be\nindistinguishable. This encourages disentanglement between the parts of the\nmotion that are common to the two domains, and their distinctive appearance and\nmotion, enabling the generation of videos that capture the motion of the one\nwhile depicting the style of the other. To enable cases where the objects are\nof different proportions or orientations, we apply a learned affine\ntransformation between the JOKRs. This augments the representation to be affine\ninvariant, and in practice broadens the variety of possible retargeting pairs.\nThis geometry-driven representation enables further intuitive control, such as\ntemporal coherence and manual editing. Through comprehensive experimentation,\nwe demonstrate the applicability of our method to different challenging\ncross-domain video pairs. We evaluate our method both qualitatively and\nquantitatively, and demonstrate that our method handles various cross-domain\nscenarios, such as different animals, different flowers, and humans. We also\ndemonstrate superior temporal coherency and visual quality compared to\nstate-of-the-art alternatives, through statistical metrics and a user study.\nSource code and videos can be found at https://rmokady.github.io/JOKR/ .",

This\nis achieved via modelling the effective class frequency based on the\nexponential forgetting observed in neural networks and encouraging the GAN to\nfocus on underrepresented classes. We demonstrate the utility of our\nregularizer in learning representations for long-tailed distributions via\nachieving better performance than existing approaches over multiple datasets.\nSpecifically, when applied to an unconditional GAN, it improves the FID from\n$13.03$ to $9.01$ on the long-tailed iNaturalist-$2019$ dataset.",

Many recently proposed approaches have demonstrated substantial\nprogress in improving DNN calibration. However, they hardly touch upon\nrefinement, which historically has been an essential aspect of calibration.\nRefinement indicates separability of a network's correct and incorrect\npredictions. This paper presents a theoretically and empirically supported\nexposition for reviewing a model's calibration and refinement. Firstly, we show\nthe breakdown of expected calibration error (ECE), into predicted confidence\nand refinement. Connecting with this result, we highlight that regularisation\nbased calibration only focuses on naively reducing a model's confidence. This\nlogically has a severe downside to a model's refinement. We support our claims\nthrough rigorous empirical evaluations of many state of the art calibration\napproaches on standard datasets. We find that many calibration approaches with\nthe likes of label smoothing, mixup etc. lower the utility of a DNN by\ndegrading its refinement. Even under natural data shift, this\ncalibration-refinement trade-off holds for the majority of calibration methods.\nThese findings call for an urgent retrospective into some popular pathways\ntaken for modern DNN calibration.",

          "description": "For a target task where labeled data is unavailable, domain adaptation can\ntransfer a learner from a different source domain. Previous deep domain\nadaptation methods mainly learn a global domain shift, i.e., align the global\nsource and target distributions without considering the relationships between\ntwo subdomains within the same category of different domains, leading to\nunsatisfying transfer learning performance without capturing the fine-grained\ninformation. Recently, more and more researchers pay attention to Subdomain\nAdaptation which focuses on accurately aligning the distributions of the\nrelevant subdomains. However, most of them are adversarial methods which\ncontain several loss functions and converge slowly. Based on this, we present\nDeep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) which learns a transfer network by\naligning the relevant subdomain distributions of domain-specific layer\nactivations across different domains based on a local maximum mean discrepancy\n(LMMD). Our DSAN is very simple but effective which does not need adversarial\ntraining and converges fast. The adaptation can be achieved easily with most\nfeed-forward network models by extending them with LMMD loss, which can be\ntrained efficiently via back-propagation. Experiments demonstrate that DSAN can\nachieve remarkable results on both object recognition tasks and digit\nclassification tasks.

          "description": "The susceptibility of deep learning models to adversarial perturbations has\nstirred renewed attention in adversarial examples resulting in a number of\nattacks. However, most of these attacks fail to encompass a large spectrum of\nadversarial perturbations that are imperceptible to humans. In this paper, we\npresent localized uncertainty attacks, a novel class of threat models against\ndeterministic and stochastic classifiers. Under this threat model, we create\nadversarial examples by perturbing only regions in the inputs where a\nclassifier is uncertain. To find such regions, we utilize the predictive\nuncertainty of the classifier when the classifier is stochastic or, we learn a\nsurrogate model to amortize the uncertainty when it is deterministic. Unlike\n$\\ell_p$ ball or functional attacks which perturb inputs indiscriminately, our\ntargeted changes can be less perceptible. When considered under our threat\nmodel, these attacks still produce strong adversarial examples; with the\nexamples retaining a greater degree of similarity with the inputs.",

          "description": "The success of deep learning heavily depends on the availability of large\nlabeled training sets. However, it is hard to get large labeled datasets in\nmedical image domain because of the strict privacy concern and costly labeling\nefforts. Contrastive learning, an unsupervised learning technique, has been\nproved powerful in learning image-level representations from unlabeled data.\nThe learned encoder can then be transferred or fine-tuned to improve the\nperformance of downstream tasks with limited labels. A critical step in\ncontrastive learning is the generation of contrastive data pairs, which is\nrelatively simple for natural image classification but quite challenging for\nmedical image segmentation due to the existence of the same tissue or organ\nacross the dataset. As a result, when applied to medical image segmentation,\nmost state-of-the-art contrastive learning frameworks inevitably introduce a\nlot of false-negative pairs and result in degraded segmentation quality. To\naddress this issue, we propose a novel positional contrastive learning (PCL)\nframework to generate contrastive data pairs by leveraging the position\ninformation in volumetric medical images. Experimental results on CT and MRI\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed PCL method can substantially improve the\nsegmentation performance compared to existing methods in both semi-supervised\nsetting and transfer learning setting.",

          "description": "Few-shot learning aims to learn a classifier using a few labelled instances\nfor each class. Metric-learning approaches for few-shot learning embed\ninstances into a high-dimensional space and conduct classification based on\ndistances among instance embeddings.

In this paper,\nwe propose a novel approach, namely \\emph{Episode Adaptive Embedding Network}\n(EAEN), to learn episode-specific embeddings of instances. By leveraging the\nprobability distributions of all instances in an episode at each channel-pixel\nembedding dimension, EAEN can not only alleviate the overfitting issue\nencountered in few-shot learning tasks, but also capture discriminative\nfeatures specific to an episode. To empirically verify the effectiveness and\nrobustness of EAEN, we have conducted extensive experiments on three widely\nused benchmark datasets, under various combinations of different generic\nembedding backbones and different classifiers.

This paper studies the operation of channel shuffle as a\nregularization technique in deep convolutional networks. We show that while\nrandom shuffling of channels during training drastically reduce their\nperformance, however, randomly shuffling small patches between channels\nsignificantly improves their performance. The patches to be shuffled are picked\nfrom the same spatial locations in the feature maps such that a patch, when\ntransferred from one channel to another, acts as structured noise for the later\nchannel. We call this method \"ShuffleBlock\". The proposed ShuffleBlock module\nis easy to implement and improves the performance of several baseline networks\non the task of image classification on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. It also\nachieves comparable and in many cases better performance than many other\nregularization methods.

In the\nfield of stereoscopic vision, the information is fairly distributed between the\nleft and right views as well as the binocular phenomenon. In this work, we\npropose to integrate these characteristics to estimate the quality of\nstereoscopic images without reference through a convolutional neural network.\nOur method is based on two main tasks: the first task predicts naturalness\nanalysis based features adapted to stereo images, while the second task\npredicts the quality of such images. The former, so-called auxiliary task, aims\nto find more robust and relevant features to improve the quality prediction. To\ndo this, we compute naturalness-based features using a Natural Scene Statistics\n(NSS) model in the complex wavelet domain. It allows to capture the statistical\ndependency between pairs of the stereoscopic images. Experiments are conducted\non the well known LIVE PHASE I and LIVE PHASE II databases. The results\nobtained show the relevance of our method when comparing with those of the\nstate-of-the-art.

To\nmitigate these problems, in this project, we present a framework that is\ncapable of controllable, confidence-based noise removal. The framework is based\non the fusion between two different denoised images, both derived from the same\nnoisy input. One of the two is denoised using generic algorithms (e.g.\nGaussian), which make few assumptions on the input images, therefore,\ngeneralize in all scenarios. The other is denoised using deep learning,\nperforming well on seen datasets. We introduce a set of techniques to fuse the\ntwo components smoothly in the frequency domain. Beyond that, we estimate the\nconfidence of a deep learning denoiser to allow users to interpret the output,\nand provide a fusion strategy that safeguards them against out-of-distribution\ninputs.

While modern devices exhibit a high level of parallelism,\nreal-time latency is still highly dependent on networks' depth. Although recent\nworks show that below a certain depth, the width of shallower networks must\ngrow exponentially, we presume that neural networks typically exceed this\nminimal depth to accelerate convergence and incrementally increase accuracy.\nThis motivates us to transform pre-trained deep networks that already exploit\nsuch advantages into shallower forms. We propose a method that learns whether\nnon-linear activations can be removed, allowing to fold consecutive linear\nlayers into one. We apply our method to networks pre-trained on CIFAR-10 and\nCIFAR-100 and find that they can all be transformed into shallower forms that\nshare a similar depth. Finally, we use our method to provide more efficient\nalternatives to MobileNetV2 and EfficientNet-Lite architectures on the ImageNet\nclassification task.",

          "description": "In Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, perception is both security and safety\ncritical. Despite various prior studies on its security issues, all of them\nonly consider attacks on camera- or LiDAR-based AD perception alone. However,\nproduction AD systems today predominantly adopt a Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF)\nbased design, which in principle can be more robust against these attacks under\nthe assumption that not all fusion sources are (or can be) attacked at the same\ntime. In this paper, we present the first study of security issues of MSF-based\nperception in AD systems. We directly challenge the basic MSF design assumption\nabove by exploring the possibility of attacking all fusion sources\nsimultaneously. This allows us for the first time to understand how much\nsecurity guarantee MSF can fundamentally provide as a general defense strategy\nfor AD perception.\n\nWe formulate the attack as an optimization problem to generate a\nphysically-realizable, adversarial 3D-printed object that misleads an AD system\nto fail in detecting it and thus crash into it. We propose a novel attack\npipeline that addresses two main design challenges: (1) non-differentiable\ntarget camera and LiDAR sensing systems, and (2) non-differentiable cell-level\naggregated features popularly used in LiDAR-based AD perception. We evaluate\nour attack on MSF included in representative open-source industry-grade AD\nsystems in real-world driving scenarios. Our results show that the attack\nachieves over 90% success rate across different object types and MSF. Our\nattack is also found stealthy, robust to victim positions, transferable across\nMSF algorithms, and physical-world realizable after being 3D-printed and\ncaptured by LiDAR and camera devices. To concretely assess the end-to-end\nsafety impact, we further perform simulation evaluation and show that it can\ncause a 100% vehicle collision rate for an industry-grade AD system.",

High-quality DVF\ntraining data is created by employing hyper-parameter optimization on the\nsubset of the training data with DICE coefficient and mutual information\nmetric. We validated our model on two radiotherapy datasets: a publicly\navailable head-and-neck dataset (28 patients with manually contoured pre-,\nmid-, and post-treatment CTs), and an internal non-small cell lung cancer\ndataset (63 patients with manually contoured planning CT and 6 weekly CBCTs).\nResults: The use of DVF representation and skip connections overcomes the\nblurring issue of ConvLSTM prediction with the traditional image\nrepresentation.

Unfortunately, these approaches still require centrally\ncollected unpaired records, potentially violating privacy and security issues.\nAlthough the recent federated learning (FL) allows a neural network to be\ntrained without data exchange, the basic assumption of the FL is that all\nclients have their own training data from a similar domain, which is different\nfrom our image-to-image translation scenario in which each client has images\nfrom its unique domain and the goal is to learn image translation between\ndifferent domains without accessing the target domain data. To address this,\nhere we propose a novel federated CycleGAN architecture that can learn image\ntranslation in an unsupervised manner while maintaining the data privacy.\nSpecifically, our approach arises from a novel observation that CycleGAN loss\ncan be decomposed into the sum of client specific local objectives that can be\nevaluated using only their data. This local objective decomposition allows\nmultiple clients to participate in federated CycleGAN training without\nsacrificing performance. Furthermore, our method employs novel switchable\ngenerator and discriminator architecture using Adaptive Instance Normalization\n(AdaIN) that significantly reduces the band-width requirement of the federated\nlearning.

This paper also shows that\nTobias has consistent improvements on training sets of different sizes, and is\nmore resilient to changes in image augmentations.

          "description": "Accurate segmentation of medical images into anatomically meaningful regions\nis critical for the extraction of quantitative indices or biomarkers. The\ncommon pipeline for segmentation comprises regions of interest detection stage\nand segmentation stage, which are independent of each other and typically\nperformed using separate deep learning networks. The performance of the\nsegmentation stage highly relies on the extracted set of spatial features and\nthe receptive fields. In this work, we propose an end-to-end network, called\nTrilateral Attention Network (TaNet), for real-time detection and segmentation\nin medical images. TaNet has a module for region localization, and three\nsegmentation pathways: 1) handcrafted pathway with hand-designed convolutional\nkernels, 2) detail pathway with regular convolutional kernels, and 3) a global\npathway to enlarge the receptive field. The first two pathways encode rich\nhandcrafted and low-level features extracted by hand-designed and regular\nkernels while the global pathway encodes high-level context information. By\njointly training the network for localization and segmentation using different\nsets of features, TaNet achieved superior performance, in terms of accuracy and\nspeed, when evaluated on an echocardiography dataset for cardiac segmentation.\nThe code and models will be made publicly available in TaNet Github page.",

          "description": "Enforcing orthogonality in neural networks is an antidote for gradient\nvanishing/exploding problems, sensitivity by adversarial perturbation, and\nbounding generalization errors. However, many previous approaches are\nheuristic, and the orthogonality of convolutional layers is not systematically\nstudied: some of these designs are not exactly orthogonal, while others only\nconsider standard convolutional layers and propose specific classes of their\nrealizations. To address this problem, we propose a theoretical framework for\northogonal convolutional layers, which establishes the equivalence between\nvarious orthogonal convolutional layers in the spatial domain and the\nparaunitary systems in the spectral domain. Since there exists a complete\nspectral factorization of paraunitary systems, any orthogonal convolution layer\ncan be parameterized as convolutions of spatial filters. Our framework endows\nhigh expressive power to various convolutional layers while maintaining their\nexact orthogonality. Furthermore, our layers are memory and computationally\nefficient for deep networks compared to previous designs. Our versatile\nframework, for the first time, enables the study of architecture designs for\ndeep orthogonal networks, such as choices of skip connection, initialization,\nstride, and dilation. Consequently, we scale up orthogonal networks to deep\narchitectures, including ResNet, WideResNet, and ShuffleNet, substantially\nincreasing the performance over the traditional shallow orthogonal networks.",

Existing unsupervised approaches to this task do not consider\nthe fact that a video typically shows a 3D environment, and that this should\nremain coherent from frame to frame even as the camera and objects move. We\naddress this by developing a model that first estimates the latent 3D structure\nof the scene, including the segmentation of any moving objects. It then\npredicts future frames by simulating the object and camera dynamics, and\nrendering the resulting views. Importantly, it is trained end-to-end using only\nthe unsupervised objective of predicting future frames, without any 3D\ninformation nor segmentation annotations.

          "description": "Video transformers have recently emerged as a competitive alternative to 3D\nCNNs for video understanding. However, due to their large number of parameters\nand reduced inductive biases, these models require supervised pretraining on\nlarge-scale image datasets to achieve top performance. In this paper, we\nempirically demonstrate that self-supervised pretraining of video transformers\non video-only datasets can lead to action recognition results that are on par\nor better than those obtained with supervised pretraining on large-scale image\ndatasets, even massive ones such as ImageNet-21K. Since transformer-based\nmodels are effective at capturing dependencies over extended temporal spans, we\npropose a simple learning procedure that forces the model to match a long-term\nview to a short-term view of the same video. Our approach, named Long-Short\nTemporal Contrastive Learning (LSTCL), enables video transformers to learn an\neffective clip-level representation by predicting temporal context captured\nfrom a longer temporal extent. To demonstrate the generality of our findings,\nwe implement and validate our approach under three different self-supervised\ncontrastive learning frameworks (MoCo v3, BYOL, SimSiam) using two distinct\nvideo-transformer architectures, including an improved variant of the Swin\nTransformer augmented with space-time attention. We conduct a thorough ablation\nstudy and show that LSTCL achieves competitive performance on multiple video\nbenchmarks and represents a convincing alternative to supervised image-based\npretraining.",

We propose an NSS method to directly search for efficient-aware\nnetwork spaces automatically, reducing the manual effort and immense cost in\ndiscovering satisfactory ones.

          "description": "Recovering 3D human pose from 2D joints is a highly unconstrained problem,\nespecially without any video or multi-view information. We present an\nunsupervised GAN-based model to recover 3D human pose from 2D joint locations\nextracted from a single image. Our model uses a GAN to learn the mapping of\ndistribution from 2D poses to 3D poses, not the simple 2D-3D correspondence.\nConsidering the reprojection constraint, our model can estimate the camera so\nthat we can reproject the estimated 3D pose to the original 2D pose. Based on\nthis reprojection method, we can rotate and reproject the generated pose to get\nour \"new\" 2D pose and then use a weight sharing generator to estimate the \"new\"\n3D pose and a \"new\" camera. Through the above estimation process, we can define\nthe single-view-multi-angle consistency loss during training to simulate\nmulti-view consistency, which means the 3D poses and cameras estimated from two\nangles of a single view should be able to be mixed to generate rich 2D\nreprojections, and the 2D reprojections reprojected from the same 3D pose\nshould be consistent. The experimental results on Human3.6M show that our\nmethod outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods, and results on\nMPI-INF-3DHP show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art by approximately\n15.0%.",

          "description": "Deep generative models such as GANs have driven impressive advances in\nconditional image synthesis in recent years. A persistent challenge has been to\ngenerate diverse versions of output images from the same input image, due to\nthe problem of mode collapse: because only one ground truth output image is\ngiven per input image, only one mode of the conditional distribution is\nmodelled. In this paper, we focus on this problem of multimodal conditional\nimage synthesis and build on the recently proposed technique of Implicit\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE). Prior IMLE-based methods required\ndifferent architectures for different tasks, which limit their applicability,\nand were lacking in fine details in the generated images. We propose CAM-Net, a\nunified architecture that can be applied to a broad range of tasks.\nAdditionally, it is capable of generating convincing high frequency details,\nachieving a reduction of the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by up to 45.3%\ncompared to the baseline.",

Our analyses and results show that the\noccurrence and values of facial AU1 and AU4, and Arousal are heightened when\nparticipants fail to use explanations effectively.

Morphed images have\nexposed face recognition systems' susceptibility to false acceptance, resulting\nin dire consequences, especially for national security applications. To detect\nmorphing attacks, we propose a method which is based on a discriminative 2D\nDiscrete Wavelet Transform (2D-DWT). A discriminative wavelet sub-band can\nhighlight inconsistencies between a real and a morphed image. We observe that\nthere is a salient discrepancy between the entropy of a given sub-band in a\nbona fide image, and the same sub-band's entropy in a morphed sample.\nConsidering this dissimilarity between these two entropy values, we find the\nKullback-Leibler divergence between the two distributions, namely the entropy\nof the bona fide and the corresponding morphed images. The most discriminative\nwavelet sub-bands are those with the highest corresponding KL-divergence\nvalues. Accordingly, 22 sub-bands are selected as the most discriminative ones\nin terms of morph detection. We show that a Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained\non the 22 discriminative sub-bands can detect morphed samples precisely. Most\nimportantly, the effectiveness of our algorithm is validated through\nexperiments on three datasets: VISAPP17, LMA, and MorGAN. We also performed an\nablation study on the sub-band selection.",

          "description": "Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to improve the generalization of several\nrelated tasks by learning them jointly. As a comparison, in addition to the\njoint training scheme, modern meta-learning allows unseen tasks with limited\nlabels during the test phase, in the hope of fast adaptation over them. Despite\nthe subtle difference between MTL and meta-learning in the problem formulation,\nboth learning paradigms share the same insight that the shared structure\nbetween existing training tasks could lead to better generalization and\nadaptation. In this paper, we take one important step further to understand the\nclose connection between these two learning paradigms, through both theoretical\nanalysis and empirical investigation. Theoretically, we first demonstrate that\nMTL shares the same optimization formulation with a class of gradient-based\nmeta-learning (GBML) algorithms. We then prove that for over-parameterized\nneural networks with sufficient depth, the learned predictive functions of MTL\nand GBML are close. In particular, this result implies that the predictions\ngiven by these two models are similar over the same unseen task. Empirically,\nwe corroborate our theoretical findings by showing that, with proper\nimplementation, MTL is competitive against state-of-the-art GBML algorithms on\na set of few-shot image classification benchmarks. Since existing GBML\nalgorithms often involve costly second-order bi-level optimization, our\nfirst-order MTL method is an order of magnitude faster on large-scale datasets\nsuch as mini-ImageNet.

          "description": "Although the adoption rate of deep neural networks (DNNs) has tremendously\nincreased in recent years, a solution for their vulnerability against\nadversarial examples has not yet been found. As a result, substantial research\nefforts are dedicated to fix this weakness, with many studies typically using a\nsubset of source images to generate adversarial examples, treating every image\nin this subset as equal. We demonstrate that, in fact, not every source image\nis equally suited for this kind of assessment. To do so, we devise a\nlarge-scale model-to-model transferability scenario for which we meticulously\nanalyze the properties of adversarial examples, generated from every suitable\nsource image in ImageNet by making use of two of the most frequently deployed\nattacks. In this transferability scenario, which involves seven distinct DNN\nmodels, including the recently proposed vision transformers, we reveal that it\nis possible to have a difference of up to $12.5\\%$ in model-to-model\ntransferability success, $1.01$ in average $L_2$ perturbation, and $0.03$\n($8/225$) in average $L_{\\infty}$ perturbation when $1,000$ source images are\nsampled randomly among all suitable candidates. We then take one of the first\nsteps in evaluating the robustness of images used to create adversarial\nexamples, proposing a number of simple but effective methods to identify\nunsuitable source images, thus making it possible to mitigate extreme cases in\nexperimentation and support high-quality benchmarking.",

          "description": "Image-to-Image (I2I) multi-domain translation models are usually evaluated\nalso using the quality of their semantic interpolation results. However,\nstate-of-the-art models frequently show abrupt changes in the image appearance\nduring interpolation, and usually perform poorly in interpolations across\ndomains. In this paper, we propose a new training protocol based on three\nspecific losses which help a translation network to learn a smooth and\ndisentangled latent style space in which: 1) Both intra- and inter-domain\ninterpolations correspond to gradual changes in the generated images and 2) The\ncontent of the source image is better preserved during the translation.\nMoreover, we propose a novel evaluation metric to properly measure the\nsmoothness of latent style space of I2I translation models. The proposed method\ncan be plugged into existing translation approaches, and our extensive\nexperiments on different datasets show that it can significantly boost the\nquality of the generated images and the graduality of the interpolations.",

The appearance representation we derive can\nthen be applied to new content, for one-shot transfer of the source style to\nnew content. We learn this disentanglement in a self-supervised manner. Our\nmethod processes entire word boxes, without requiring segmentation of text from\nbackground, per-character processing, or making assumptions on string lengths.\nWe show results in different text domains which were previously handled by\nspecialized methods, e.g., scene text, handwritten text. To these ends, we make\na number of technical contributions: (1) We disentangle the style and content\nof a textual image into a non-parametric, fixed-dimensional vector. (2) We\npropose a novel approach inspired by StyleGAN but conditioned over the example\nstyle at different resolution and content. (3) We present novel self-supervised\ntraining criteria which preserve both source style and target content using a\npre-trained font classifier and text recognizer. Finally, (4) we also introduce\nImgur5K, a new challenging dataset for handwritten word images. We offer\nnumerous qualitative photo-realistic results of our method.

          "description": "Recent works have shown that interval bound propagation (IBP) can be used to\ntrain verifiably robust neural networks. Reseachers observe an intriguing\nphenomenon on these IBP trained networks: CROWN, a bounding method based on\ntight linear relaxation, often gives very loose bounds on these networks. We\nalso observe that most neurons become dead during the IBP training process,\nwhich could hurt the representation capability of the network. In this paper,\nwe study the relationship between IBP and CROWN, and prove that CROWN is always\ntighter than IBP when choosing appropriate bounding lines. We further propose a\nrelaxed version of CROWN, linear bound propagation (LBP), that can be used to\nverify large networks to obtain lower verified errors than IBP. We also design\na new activation function, parameterized ramp function (ParamRamp), which has\nmore diversity of neuron status than ReLU. We conduct extensive experiments on\nMNIST, CIFAR-10 and Tiny-ImageNet with ParamRamp activation and achieve\nstate-of-the-art verified robustness.

          "description": "Purpose: In current clinical practice, noisy and artifact-ridden weekly\ncone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images are only used for patient setup\nduring radiotherapy. Treatment planning is done once at the beginning of the\ntreatment using high-quality planning CT (pCT) images and manual contours for\norgans-at-risk (OARs) structures. If the quality of the weekly CBCT images can\nbe improved while simultaneously segmenting OAR structures, this can provide\ncritical information for adapting radiotherapy mid-treatment as well as for\nderiving biomarkers for treatment response. Methods: Using a novel\nphysics-based data augmentation strategy, we synthesize a large dataset of\nperfectly/inherently registered planning CT and synthetic-CBCT pairs for\nlocally advanced lung cancer patient cohort, which are then used in a multitask\n3D deep learning framework to simultaneously segment and translate real weekly\nCBCT images to high-quality planning CT-like images. Results: We compared the\nsynthetic CT and OAR segmentations generated by the model to real planning CT\nand manual OAR segmentations and showed promising results. The real week 1\n(baseline) CBCT images which had an average MAE of 162.77 HU compared to pCT\nimages are translated to synthetic CT images that exhibit a drastically\nimproved average MAE of 29.31 HU and average structural similarity of 92% with\nthe pCT images. The average DICE scores of the 3D organs-at-risk segmentations\nare: lungs 0.96, heart 0.88, spinal cord 0.83 and esophagus 0.66. Conclusions:\nWe demonstrate an approach to translate artifact-ridden CBCT images to high\nquality synthetic CT images while simultaneously generating good quality\nsegmentation masks for different organs-at-risk. This approach could allow\nclinicians to adjust treatment plans using only the routine low-quality CBCT\nimages, potentially improving patient outcomes.",

          "description": "Explaining the decisions of models is becoming pervasive in the image\nprocessing domain, whether it is by using post-hoc methods or by creating\ninherently interpretable models. While the widespread use of surrogate\nexplainers is a welcome addition to inspect and understand black-box models,\nassessing the robustness and reliability of the explanations is key for their\nsuccess. Additionally, whilst existing work in the explainability field\nproposes various strategies to address this problem, the challenges of working\nwith data in the wild is often overlooked. For instance, in image\nclassification, distortions to images can not only affect the predictions\nassigned by the model, but also the explanation. Given a clean and a distorted\nversion of an image, even if the prediction probabilities are similar, the\nexplanation may still be different. In this paper we propose a methodology to\nevaluate the effect of distortions in explanations by embedding perceptual\ndistances that tailor the neighbourhoods used to training surrogate explainers.\nWe also show that by operating in this way, we can make the explanations more\nrobust to distortions. We generate explanations for images in the Imagenet-C\ndataset and demonstrate how using a perceptual distances in the surrogate\nexplainer creates more coherent explanations for the distorted and reference\nimages.",

          "description": "Previous studies have verified that the functionality of black-box models can\nbe stolen with full probability outputs. However, under the more practical\nhard-label setting, we observe that existing methods suffer from catastrophic\nperformance degradation. We argue this is due to the lack of rich information\nin the probability prediction and the overfitting caused by hard labels. To\nthis end, we propose a novel hard-label model stealing method termed\n\\emph{black-box dissector}, which consists of two erasing-based modules. One is\na CAM-driven erasing strategy that is designed to increase the information\ncapacity hidden in hard labels from the victim model.

          "description": "A driver's gaze is critical for determining their attention, state,\nsituational awareness, and readiness to take over control from partially\nautomated vehicles. Estimating the gaze direction is the most obvious way to\ngauge a driver's state under ideal conditions when limited to using\nnon-intrusive imaging sensors. Unfortunately, the vehicular environment\nintroduces a variety of challenges that are usually unaccounted for - harsh\nillumination, nighttime conditions, and reflective eyeglasses. Relying on head\npose alone under such conditions can prove to be unreliable and erroneous. In\nthis study, we offer solutions to address these problems encountered in the\nreal world. To solve issues with lighting, we demonstrate that using an\ninfrared camera with suitable equalization and normalization suffices. To\nhandle eyeglasses and their corresponding artifacts, we adopt image-to-image\ntranslation using generative adversarial networks to pre-process images prior\nto gaze estimation. Our proposed Gaze Preserving CycleGAN (GPCycleGAN) is\ntrained to preserve the driver's gaze while removing potential eyeglasses from\nface images. GPCycleGAN is based on the well-known CycleGAN approach - with the\naddition of a gaze classifier and a gaze consistency loss for additional\nsupervision. Our approach exhibits improved performance, interpretability,\nrobustness and superior qualitative results on challenging real-world datasets.",

          "description": "Face recognition is an important yet challenging problem in computer vision.\nA major challenge in practical face recognition applications lies in\nsignificant variations between profile and frontal faces. Traditional\ntechniques address this challenge either by synthesizing frontal faces or by\npose invariant learning. In this paper, we propose a novel method with Lie\nalgebra theory to explore how face rotation in the 3D space affects the deep\nfeature generation process of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We prove\nthat face rotation in the image space is equivalent to an additive residual\ncomponent in the feature space of CNNs, which is determined solely by the\nrotation. Based on this theoretical finding, we further design a Lie Algebraic\nResidual Network (LARNet) for tackling pose robust face recognition. Our LARNet\nconsists of a residual subnet for decoding rotation information from input face\nimages, and a gating subnet to learn rotation magnitude for controlling the\nstrength of the residual component contributing to the feature learning\nprocess. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on both frontal-profile face\ndatasets and general face recognition datasets convincingly demonstrate that\nour method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ones.",

          "description": "Recent studies reveal that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are typically\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose a threat to security-sensitive\napplications. Many adversarial defense methods improve robustness at the cost\nof accuracy, raising the contradiction between standard and adversarial\naccuracies. In this paper, we observe an interesting phenomenon that feature\nstatistics change monotonically and smoothly w.r.t the rising of attacking\nstrength. Based on this observation, we propose the adaptive feature alignment\n(AFA) to generate features of arbitrary attacking strengths. Our method is\ntrained to automatically align features of arbitrary attacking strength. This\nis done by predicting a fusing weight in a dual-BN architecture. Unlike\nprevious works that need to either retrain the model or manually tune a\nhyper-parameters for different attacking strengths, our method can deal with\narbitrary attacking strengths with a single model without introducing any\nhyper-parameter. Importantly, our method improves the model robustness against\nadversarial samples without incurring much loss in standard accuracy.\nExperiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and tiny-ImageNet datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod outperforms the state-of-the-art under a wide range of attacking\nstrengths.",

          "description": "The COVID-19 virus has caused a global pandemic since March 2020. The World\nHealth Organization (WHO) has provided guidelines on how to reduce the spread\nof the virus and one of the most important measures is social distancing.\nMaintaining a minimum of one meter distance from other people is strongly\nsuggested to reduce the risk of infection. This has created a strong interest\nin monitoring the social distances either as a safety measure or to study how\nthe measures have affected human behavior and country-wise differences in this.\nThe need for automatic social distance estimation algorithms is evident, but\nthere is no suitable test benchmark for such algorithms. Collecting images with\nmeasured ground-truth pair-wise distances between all the people using\ndifferent camera settings is cumbersome. Furthermore, performance evaluation\nfor social distance estimation algorithms is not straightforward and there is\nno widely accepted evaluation protocol. In this paper, we provide a dataset of\nvarying images with measured pair-wise social distances under different camera\npositionings and focal length values. We suggest a performance evaluation\nprotocol and provide a benchmark to easily evaluate social distance estimation\nalgorithms. We also propose a method for automatic social distance estimation.\nOur method takes advantage of object detection and human pose estimation. It\ncan be applied on any single image as long as focal length and sensor size\ninformation are known. The results on our benchmark are encouraging with 92%\nhuman detection rate and only 28.9% average error in distance estimation among\nthe detected people.",

A series of constraints are provided to guarantee the\nstability and discriminability of the fingerprint, which in turn helps\ncontent-irrelevant feature extraction. Further, we perform comprehensive\nanalysis on GAN fingerprint, providing some clues about the properties of GAN\nfingerprint and which factors dominate the fingerprint in GAN architecture.\nExperiments show that our GFD-Net achieves superior fake image attribution\nperformance in both closed-world and open-world testing.

Many deep learning based methods have been developed\nin the past few years. However, since there are no intended HR MS images as\nreferences for learning, almost all of the existing methods down-sample the MS\nand PAN images and regard the original MS images as targets to form a\nsupervised setting for training. These methods may perform well on the\ndown-scaled images, however, they generalize poorly to the full-resolution\nimages. To conquer this problem, we design an unsupervised framework that is\nable to learn directly from the full-resolution images without any\npreprocessing. The model is built based on a novel generative multi-adversarial\nnetwork. We use a two-stream generator to extract the modality-specific\nfeatures from the PAN and MS images, respectively, and develop a\ndual-discriminator to preserve the spectral and spatial information of the\ninputs when performing fusion. Furthermore, a novel loss function is introduced\nto facilitate training under the unsupervised setting.

          "description": "With the complexity of the network structure, uncertainty inference has\nbecome an important task to improve the classification accuracy for artificial\nintelligence systems. For image classification tasks, we propose a structured\nDropConnect (SDC) framework to model the output of a deep neural network by a\nDirichlet distribution. We introduce a DropConnect strategy on weights in the\nfully connected layers during training. In test, we split the network into\nseveral sub-networks, and then model the Dirichlet distribution by match its\nmoments with the mean and variance of the outputs of these sub-networks. The\nentropy of the estimated Dirichlet distribution is finally utilized for\nuncertainty inference. In this paper, this framework is implemented on LeNet$5$\nand VGG$16$ models for misclassification detection and out-of-distribution\ndetection on MNIST and CIFAR-$10$ datasets. Experimental results show that the\nperformance of the proposed SDC can be comparable to other uncertainty\ninference methods. Furthermore, the SDC is adapted well to different network\nstructures with certain generalization capabilities and research prospects.",

Nevertheless, due to\nvarious special challenges in UAV tracking, \\textit{e.g.}, severe occlusion,\nand fast motion, most existing Siamese-based trackers hardly combine superior\nperformance with high efficiency. To this concern, in this paper, a novel\nattentional Siamese tracker (SiamAPN++) is proposed for real-time UAV tracking.\nBy virtue of the attention mechanism, the attentional aggregation network (AAN)\nis conducted with self-AAN and cross-AAN, raising the expression ability of\nfeatures eventually. The former AAN aggregates and models the self-semantic\ninterdependencies of the single feature map via spatial and channel dimensions.\nThe latter aims to aggregate the cross-interdependencies of different semantic\nfeatures including the location information of anchors. In addition, the dual\nfeatures version of the anchor proposal network is proposed to raise the\nrobustness of proposing anchors, increasing the perception ability to objects\nwith various scales. Experiments on two well-known authoritative benchmarks are\nconducted, where SiamAPN++ outperforms its baseline SiamAPN and other SOTA\ntrackers. Besides, real-world tests onboard a typical embedded platform\ndemonstrate that SiamAPN++ achieves promising tracking results with real-time\nspeed.",

Over\nthe years, several deep learning approaches have been proposed to address this\ntask, however their performance has been subpar compared to handcrafted\ntechniques, especially while dealing with reverse loops. In this paper, we\nintroduce the novel LCDNet that effectively detects loop closures in LiDAR\npoint clouds by simultaneously identifying previously visited places and\nestimating the 6-DoF relative transformation between the current scan and the\nmap. LCDNet is composed of a shared encoder, a place recognition head that\nextracts global descriptors, and a relative pose head that estimates the\ntransformation between two point clouds. We introduce a novel relative pose\nhead based on the unbalanced optimal transport theory that we implement in a\ndifferentiable manner to allow for end-to-end training. Extensive evaluations\nof LCDNet on multiple real-world autonomous driving datasets show that our\napproach outperforms state-of-the-art loop closure detection and point cloud\nregistration techniques by a large margin, especially while dealing with\nreverse loops.

In this work, we further expand this space by\nconsidering visual questions that include a spatial point of reference.\nPointing is a nearly universal gesture among humans, and real-world VQA is\nlikely to involve a gesture towards the target region.\n\nConcretely, we (1) introduce and motivate point-input questions as an\nextension of VQA, (2) define three novel classes of questions within this\nspace, and (3) for each class, introduce both a benchmark dataset and a series\nof baseline models to handle its unique challenges.

          "description": "Unsupervised domain adaptation is useful in medical image segmentation.\nParticularly, when ground truths of the target images are not available, domain\nadaptation can train a target-specific model by utilizing the existing labeled\nimages from other modalities. Most of the reported works mapped images of both\nthe source and target domains into a common latent feature space, and then\nreduced their discrepancy either implicitly with adversarial training or\nexplicitly by directly minimizing a discrepancy metric. In this work, we\npropose a new framework, where the latent features of both domains are driven\ntowards a common and parameterized variational form, whose conditional\ndistribution given the image is Gaussian. This is achieved by two networks\nbased on variational auto-encoders (VAEs) and a regularization for this\nvariational approximation. Both of the VAEs, each for one domain, contain a\nsegmentation module, where the source segmentation is trained in a supervised\nmanner, while the target one is trained unsupervisedly. We validated the\nproposed domain adaptation method using two cardiac segmentation tasks, i.e.,\nthe cross-modality (CT and MR) whole heart segmentation and the cross-sequence\ncardiac MR segmentation. Results show that the proposed method achieved better\naccuracies compared to two state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrated good\npotential for cardiac segmentation. Furthermore, the proposed explicit\nregularization was shown to be effective and efficient in narrowing down the\ndistribution gap between domains, which is useful for unsupervised domain\nadaptation.

          "description": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated unprecedented\nsuccess in various image generation tasks. The encouraging results, however,\ncome at the price of a cumbersome training process, during which the generator\nand discriminator are alternately updated in two stages. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a general training scheme that enables training GANs efficiently in\nonly one stage. Based on the adversarial losses of the generator and\ndiscriminator, we categorize GANs into two classes, Symmetric GANs and\nAsymmetric GANs, and introduce a novel gradient decomposition method to unify\nthe two, allowing us to train both classes in one stage and hence alleviate the\ntraining effort. We also computationally analyze the efficiency of the proposed\nmethod, and empirically demonstrate that, the proposed method yields a solid\n$1.5\\times$ acceleration across various datasets and network architectures.\nFurthermore, we show that the proposed method is readily applicable to other\nadversarial-training scenarios, such as data-free knowledge distillation.

          "description": "The study of video prediction models is believed to be a fundamental approach\nto representation learning for videos. While a plethora of generative models\nfor predicting the future frame pixel values given the past few frames exist,\nthe quantitative evaluation of the predicted frames has been found to be\nextremely challenging. In this context, we introduce the problem of naturalness\nevaluation, which refers to how natural or realistic a predicted video looks.\nWe create the Indian Institute of Science VIdeo Naturalness Evaluation (IISc\nVINE) Database consisting of 300 videos, obtained by applying different\nprediction models on different datasets, and accompanying human opinion scores.\nWe collected subjective ratings of naturalness from 50 human participants for\nthese videos. Our subjective study reveals that human observers were highly\nconsistent in their judgments of naturalness. We benchmark several popularly\nused measures for evaluating video prediction and show that they do not\nadequately correlate with these subjective scores. We introduce two new\nfeatures to effectively capture naturalness, motion-compensated cosine\nsimilarities of deep features of predicted frames with past frames, and deep\nfeatures extracted from rescaled frame differences. We show that our feature\ndesign leads to state of the art naturalness prediction in accordance with\nhuman judgments on our IISc VINE Database.

          "description": "Modern feedforward convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can now solve some\ncomputer vision tasks at super-human levels. However, these networks only\nroughly mimic human visual perception. One difference from human vision is that\nthey do not appear to perceive illusory contours (e.g. Kanizsa squares) in the\nsame way humans do. Physiological evidence from visual cortex suggests that the\nperception of illusory contours could involve feedback connections. Would\nrecurrent feedback neural networks perceive illusory contours like humans? In\nthis work we equip a deep feedforward convolutional network with brain-inspired\nrecurrent dynamics. The network was first pretrained with an unsupervised\nreconstruction objective on a natural image dataset, to expose it to natural\nobject contour statistics. Then, a classification decision layer was added and\nthe model was finetuned on a form discrimination task: squares vs. randomly\noriented inducer shapes (no illusory contour). Finally, the model was tested\nwith the unfamiliar ''illusory contour'' configuration: inducer shapes oriented\nto form an illusory square. Compared with feedforward baselines, the iterative\n''predictive coding'' feedback resulted in more illusory contours being\nclassified as physical squares. The perception of the illusory contour was\nmeasurable in the luminance profile of the image reconstructions produced by\nthe model, demonstrating that the model really ''sees'' the illusion. Ablation\nstudies revealed that natural image pretraining and feedback error correction\nare both critical to the perception of the illusion. Finally we validated our\nconclusions in a deeper network (VGG): adding the same predictive coding\nfeedback dynamics again leads to the perception of illusory contours.",

Backdoor attackers tamper with training\ndata to embed a vulnerability in models that are trained on that data. This\nvulnerability is then activated at inference time by placing a \"trigger\" into\nthe model's input. Typical backdoor attacks insert the trigger directly into\nthe training data, although the presence of such an attack may be visible upon\ninspection. In contrast, the Hidden Trigger Backdoor Attack achieves poisoning\nwithout placing a trigger into the training data at all. However, this hidden\ntrigger attack is ineffective at poisoning neural networks trained from\nscratch. We develop a new hidden trigger attack, Sleeper Agent, which employs\ngradient matching, data selection, and target model re-training during the\ncrafting process.

Here, we propose to leverage\ncontinuous proxy metadata, in the contrastive learning framework, by\nintroducing a new loss called y-Aware InfoNCE loss. Specifically, we improve\nthe positive sampling during pre-training by adding more positive examples with\nsimilar proxy meta-data with the anchor, assuming they share similar\ndiscriminative semantic features.With our method, a 3D CNN model pre-trained on\n$10^4$ multi-site healthy brain MRI scans can extract relevant features for\nthree classification tasks: schizophrenia, bipolar diagnosis and Alzheimer's\ndetection. When fine-tuned, it also outperforms 3D CNN trained from scratch on\nthese tasks, as well as state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. Our code is\nmade publicly available here.",

          "description": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a wide class of connectionist models for\ngraph processing. They perform an iterative message passing operation on each\nnode and its neighbors, to solve classification/ clustering tasks --- on some\nnodes or on the whole graph --- collecting all such messages, regardless of\ntheir order. Despite the differences among the various models belonging to this\nclass, most of them adopt the same computation scheme, based on a local\naggregation mechanism and, intuitively, the local computation framework is\nmainly responsible for the expressive power of GNNs. In this paper, we prove\nthat the Weisfeiler--Lehman test induces an equivalence relationship on the\ngraph nodes that exactly corresponds to the unfolding equivalence, defined on\nthe original GNN model. Therefore, the results on the expressive power of the\noriginal GNNs can be extended to general GNNs which, under mild conditions, can\nbe proved capable of approximating, in probability and up to any precision, any\nfunction on graphs that respects the unfolding equivalence.",

Without access to data, conventional\ndata-driven model compression faces a higher risk of performance degradation.\nRecently, some works propose to generate images from a specific pretrained\nmodel to serve as training data.

As a consequence, it inevitably encounters the difficulties of\ngeneralizability and inexact inversion, which leads to unsatisfactory\nperformance. To address these problems, we propose MixMix based on two simple\nyet effective techniques: (1) Feature Mixing: utilizes various models to\nconstruct a universal feature space for generalized inversion; (2) Data Mixing:\nmixes the synthesized images and labels to generate exact label information. We\nprove the effectiveness of MixMix from both theoretical and empirical\nperspectives. Extensive experiments show that MixMix outperforms existing\nmethods on the mainstream compression tasks, including quantization, knowledge\ndistillation, and pruning.

          "description": "Convolutional neural networks for visual recognition require large amounts of\ntraining samples and usually benefit from data augmentation. This paper\nproposes PatchMix, a data augmentation method that creates new samples by\ncomposing patches from pairs of images in a grid-like pattern. These new\nsamples' ground truth labels are set as proportional to the number of patches\nfrom each image. We then add a set of additional losses at the patch-level to\nregularize and to encourage good representations at both the patch and image\nlevels. A ResNet-50 model trained on ImageNet using PatchMix exhibits superior\ntransfer learning capabilities across a wide array of benchmarks. Although\nPatchMix can rely on random pairings and random grid-like patterns for mixing,\nwe explore evolutionary search as a guiding strategy to discover optimal\ngrid-like patterns and image pairing jointly. For this purpose, we conceive a\nfitness function that bypasses the need to re-train a model to evaluate each\nchoice. In this way, PatchMix outperforms a base model on CIFAR-10 (+1.91),\nCIFAR-100 (+5.31), Tiny Imagenet (+3.52), and ImageNet (+1.16) by significant\nmargins, also outperforming previous state-of-the-art pairwise augmentation\nstrategies.",

          "description": "Adversarial training has been the topic of dozens of studies and a leading\nmethod for defending against adversarial attacks. Yet, it remains largely\nunknown (a) how adversarially-robust ImageNet classifiers (R classifiers)\ngeneralize to out-of-distribution examples; and (b) how their generalization\ncapability relates to their hidden representations. In this paper, we perform a\nthorough, systematic study to answer these two questions across AlexNet,\nGoogLeNet, and ResNet-50 architectures. We found that while standard ImageNet\nclassifiers have a strong texture bias, their R counterparts rely heavily on\nshapes. Remarkably, adversarial training induces three simplicity biases into\nhidden neurons in the process of 'robustifying' the network. That is, each\nconvolutional neuron in R networks often changes to detecting (1) pixel-wise\nsmoother patterns i.e. a mechanism that blocks high-frequency noise from\npassing through the network; (2) more lower-level features i.e. textures and\ncolors (instead of objects); and (3) fewer types of inputs. Our findings reveal\nthe interesting mechanisms that made networks more adversarially robust and\nalso explain some recent findings. Our findings reveal the interesting\nmechanisms that made networks more adversarially robust and also explain some\nrecent findings e.g. why R networks benefit from much larger capacity (Xie and\nYuille, 2020) and can act as a strong image prior in image synthesis (Santurkar\net al., 2019).",

In this work, we propose a simple two-step post-processing procedure,\nSplit and Expand, that directly improves the conversion of segmentation maps to\ninstances. In the splitting step, we generate fine-grained cell instances from\nthe segmentation map with the guidance of cell-center predictions. For the\nexpansion step, we utilize Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) explanation\nresults to add small cells that are not captured in the segmentation map.\nAlthough we additionally train an output head to predict cell-centers, the\npost-processing procedure itself is not explicitly trained and is executed at\ninference-time only. A feature re-weighting loss based on LRP is proposed to\nimprove our method even further. We test our procedure on the MoNuSeg and TNBC\ndatasets and show quantitatively and qualitatively that our proposed method\nimproves object-level metrics substantially.",

          "description": "Training sparse networks to converge to the same performance as dense neural\narchitectures has proven to be elusive. Recent work suggests that\ninitialization is the key. However, while this direction of research has had\nsome success, focusing on initialization alone appears to be inadequate. In\nthis paper, we take a broader view of training sparse networks and consider the\nrole of regularization, optimization, and architecture choices on sparse\nmodels. We propose a simple experimental framework, Same Capacity Sparse vs\nDense Comparison (SC-SDC), that allows for a fair comparison of sparse and\ndense networks. Furthermore, we propose a new measure of gradient flow,\nEffective Gradient Flow (EGF), that better correlates to performance in sparse\nnetworks. Using top-line metrics, SC-SDC and EGF, we show that default choices\nof optimizers, activation functions and regularizers used for dense networks\ncan disadvantage sparse networks. Based upon these findings, we show that\ngradient flow in sparse networks can be improved by reconsidering aspects of\nthe architecture design and the training regime. Our work suggests that\ninitialization is only one piece of the puzzle and taking a wider view of\ntailoring optimization to sparse networks yields promising results.",

          "description": "Using generative models to synthesize visual features from semantic\ndistribution is one of the most popular solutions to ZSL image classification\nin recent years. The triplet loss (TL) is popularly used to generate realistic\nvisual distributions from semantics by automatically searching discriminative\nrepresentations. However, the traditional TL cannot search reliable unseen\ndisentangled representations due to the unavailability of unseen classes in\nZSL. To alleviate this drawback, we propose in this work a multi-modal triplet\nloss (MMTL) which utilizes multimodal information to search a disentangled\nrepresentation space. As such, all classes can interplay which can benefit\nlearning disentangled class representations in the searched space. Furthermore,\nwe develop a novel model called Disentangling Class Representation Generative\nAdversarial Network (DCR-GAN) focusing on exploiting the disentangled\nrepresentations in training, feature synthesis, and final recognition stages.\nBenefiting from the disentangled representations, DCR-GAN could fit a more\nrealistic distribution over both seen and unseen features.

Firstly,\nthey are limited in scale. Secondly, training sets contain only video-level\nlabels indicating the existence of an abnormal event during the full video\nwhile lacking annotations of precise time durations. To tackle these problems,\nwe contribute a new Large-scale Anomaly Detection (LAD) database as the\nbenchmark for anomaly detection in video sequences, which is featured in two\naspects. 1) It contains 2000 video sequences including normal and abnormal\nvideo clips with 14 anomaly categories including crash, fire, violence, etc.\nwith large scene varieties, making it the largest anomaly analysis database to\ndate. 2) It provides the annotation data, including video-level labels\n(abnormal/normal video, anomaly type) and frame-level labels (abnormal/normal\nvideo frame) to facilitate anomaly detection. Leveraging the above benefits\nfrom the LAD database, we further formulate anomaly detection as a\nfully-supervised learning problem and propose a multi-task deep neural network\nto solve it. We first obtain the local spatiotemporal contextual feature by\nusing an Inflated 3D convolutional (I3D) network. Then we construct a recurrent\nconvolutional neural network fed the local spatiotemporal contextual feature to\nextract the spatiotemporal contextual feature.

Our image representation based on image patches naturally\nhandles the position and scale invariance property that is crucial to\nmulti-object discovery. The method has been proven surprisingly effective, and\nsuccessfully applied to finding multiple human faces and bodies from natural\nimages.",

          "description": "Video anomaly detection has gained significant attention due to the\nincreasing requirements of automatic monitoring for surveillance videos.\nEspecially, the prediction based approach is one of the most studied methods to\ndetect anomalies by predicting frames that include abnormal events in the test\nset after learning with the normal frames of the training set. However, a lot\nof prediction networks are computationally expensive owing to the use of\npre-trained optical flow networks, or fail to detect abnormal situations\nbecause of their strong generative ability to predict even the anomalies. To\naddress these shortcomings, we propose spatial rotation transformation (SRT)\nand temporal mixing transformation (TMT) to generate irregular patch cuboids\nwithin normal frame cuboids in order to enhance the learning of normal\nfeatures. Additionally, the proposed patch transformation is used only during\nthe training phase, allowing our model to detect abnormal frames at fast speed\nduring inference.

          "description": "Deep learning-based multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (MUDA) has\nbeen actively studied in recent years. Compared with single-source unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (SUDA), domain shift in MUDA exists not only between the\nsource and target domains but also among multiple source domains. Most existing\nMUDA algorithms focus on extracting domain-invariant representations among all\ndomains whereas the task-specific decision boundaries among classes are largely\nneglected. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end trainable network that\nexploits domain Consistency Regularization for unsupervised Multi-source domain\nAdaptive classification (CRMA). CRMA aligns not only the distributions of each\npair of source and target domains but also that of all domains. For each pair\nof source and target domains, we employ an intra-domain consistency to\nregularize a pair of domain-specific classifiers to achieve intra-domain\nalignment. In addition, we design an inter-domain consistency that targets\njoint inter-domain alignment among all domains. To address different\nsimilarities between multiple source domains and the target domain, we design\nan authorization strategy that assigns different authorities to domain-specific\nclassifiers adaptively for optimal pseudo label prediction and self-training.\nExtensive experiments show that CRMA tackles unsupervised domain adaptation\neffectively under a multi-source setup and achieves superior adaptation\nconsistently across multiple MUDA datasets.",

          "description": "Visual analytics have played an increasingly critical role in the Internet of\nThings, where massive visual signals have to be compressed and fed into\nmachines. But facing such big data and constrained bandwidth capacity, existing\nimage/video compression methods lead to very low-quality representations, while\nexisting feature compression techniques fail to support diversified visual\nanalytics applications/tasks with low-bit-rate representations. In this paper,\nwe raise and study the novel problem of supporting multiple machine vision\nanalytics tasks with the compressed visual representation, namely, the\ninformation compression problem in analytics taxonomy. By utilizing the\nintrinsic transferability among different tasks, our framework successfully\nconstructs compact and expressive representations at low bit-rates to support a\ndiversified set of machine vision tasks, including both high-level\nsemantic-related tasks and mid-level geometry analytic tasks. In order to\nimpose compactness in the representations, we propose a codebook-based\nhyperprior, which helps map the representation into a low-dimensional manifold.\nAs it well fits the signal structure of the deep visual feature, it facilitates\nmore accurate entropy estimation, and results in higher compression efficiency.\nWith the proposed framework and the codebook-based hyperprior, we further\ninvestigate the relationship of different task features owning different levels\nof abstraction granularity. Experimental results demonstrate that with the\nproposed scheme, a set of diversified tasks can be supported at a significantly\nlower bit-rate, compared with existing compression schemes.",

          "description": "The integrated positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging\n(PET/MRI) scanner facilitates the simultaneous acquisition of metabolic\ninformation via PET and morphological information with high soft-tissue\ncontrast using MRI. Although PET/MRI facilitates the capture of high-accuracy\nfusion images, its major drawback can be attributed to the difficulty\nencountered when performing attenuation correction, which is necessary for\nquantitative PET evaluation. The combined PET/MRI scanning requires the\ngeneration of attenuation-correction maps from MRI owing to no direct\nrelationship between the gamma-ray attenuation information and MRIs. While\nMRI-based bone-tissue segmentation can be readily performed for the head and\npelvis regions, the realization of accurate bone segmentation via chest CT\ngeneration remains a challenging task. This can be attributed to the\nrespiratory and cardiac motions occurring in the chest as well as its\nanatomically complicated structure and relatively thin bone cortex. This paper\npresents a means to minimise the anatomical structural changes without human\nannotation by adding structural constraints using a modality-independent\nneighbourhood descriptor (MIND) to a generative adversarial network (GAN) that\ncan transform unpaired images. The results obtained in this study revealed the\nproposed U-GAT-IT + MIND approach to outperform all other competing approaches.\nThe findings of this study hint towards possibility of synthesising clinically\nacceptable CT images from chest MRI without human annotation, thereby\nminimising the changes in the anatomical structure.",

          "description": "The abundance and ease of utilizing sound, along with the fact that auditory\nclues reveal so much about what happens in the scene, make the audio-visual\nspace a perfectly intuitive choice for self-supervised representation learning.\nHowever, the current literature suggests that training on \\textit{uncurated}\ndata yields considerably poorer representations compared to the\n\\textit{curated} alternatives collected in supervised manner, and the gap only\nnarrows when the volume of data significantly increases. Furthermore, the\nquality of learned representations is known to be heavily influenced by the\nsize and taxonomy of the curated datasets used for self-supervised training.\nThis begs the question of whether we are celebrating too early on catching up\nwith supervised learning when our self-supervised efforts still rely almost\nexclusively on curated data. In this paper, we study the efficacy of learning\nfrom Movies and TV Shows as forms of uncurated data for audio-visual\nself-supervised learning. We demonstrate that a simple model based on\ncontrastive learning, trained on a collection of movies and TV shows, not only\ndramatically outperforms more complex methods which are trained on orders of\nmagnitude larger uncurated datasets, but also performs very competitively with\nthe state-of-the-art that learns from large-scale curated data. We identify\nthat audiovisual patterns like the appearance of the main character or\nprominent scenes and mise-en-sc\\`ene which frequently occur through the whole\nduration of a movie, lead to an overabundance of easy negative instances in the\ncontrastive learning formulation. Capitalizing on such observation, we propose\na hierarchical sampling policy, which despite its simplicity, effectively\nimproves the performance, particularly when learning from TV shows which\nnaturally face less semantic diversity.",

          "description": "In this work, we seek new insights into the underlying challenges of the\nScene Graph Generation (SGG) task. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the\nVisual Genome dataset implies -- 1) Ambiguity: even if inter-object\nrelationship contains the same object (or predicate), they may not be visually\nor semantically similar, 2) Asymmetry: despite the nature of the relationship\nthat embodied the direction, it was not well addressed in previous studies, and\n3) Higher-order contexts: leveraging the identities of certain graph elements\ncan help to generate accurate scene graphs. Motivated by the analysis, we\ndesign a novel SGG framework, Local-to-Global Interaction Networks (LOGIN).\nLocally, interactions extract the essence between three instances - subject,\nobject, and background - while baking direction awareness into the network by\nconstraining the input order. Globally, interactions encode the contexts\nbetween every graph components -- nodes and edges. Also we introduce Attract &\nRepel loss which finely adjusts predicate embeddings. Our framework enables\npredicting the scene graph in a local-to-global manner by design, leveraging\nthe possible complementariness. To quantify how much LOGIN is aware of\nrelational direction, we propose a new diagnostic task called Bidirectional\nRelationship Classification (BRC). We see that LOGIN can successfully\ndistinguish relational direction than existing methods (in BRC task) while\nshowing state-of-the-art results on the Visual Genome benchmark (in SGG task).",

However, most existing methods ignore\nexploring the class-level knowledge that can be easily learned by humans from\njust a handful of samples. In this paper, we propose an Explicit Class\nKnowledge Propagation Network (ECKPN), which is composed of the comparison,\nsqueeze and calibration modules, to address this problem. Specifically, we\nfirst employ the comparison module to explore the pairwise sample relations to\nlearn rich sample representations in the instance-level graph. Then, we squeeze\nthe instance-level graph to generate the class-level graph, which can help\nobtain the class-level visual knowledge and facilitate modeling the relations\nof different classes. Next, the calibration module is adopted to characterize\nthe relations of the classes explicitly to obtain the more discriminative\nclass-level knowledge representations. Finally, we combine the class-level\nknowledge with the instance-level sample representations to guide the inference\nof the query samples. We conduct extensive experiments on four few-shot\nclassification benchmarks, and the experimental results show that the proposed\nECKPN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Predicting the future motion of multiple agents is necessary for planning in\ndynamic environments. This task is challenging for autonomous driving since\nagents (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians) and their associated behaviors may be\ndiverse and influence each other. Most prior work has focused on first\npredicting independent futures for each agent based on all past motion, and\nthen planning against these independent predictions. However, planning against\nfixed predictions can suffer from the inability to represent the future\ninteraction possibilities between different agents, leading to sub-optimal\nplanning. In this work, we formulate a model for predicting the behavior of all\nagents jointly in real-world driving environments in a unified manner. Inspired\nby recent language modeling approaches, we use a masking strategy as the query\nto our model, enabling one to invoke a single model to predict agent behavior\nin many ways, such as potentially conditioned on the goal or full future\ntrajectory of the autonomous vehicle or the behavior of other agents in the\nenvironment. Our model architecture fuses heterogeneous world state in a\nunified Transformer architecture by employing attention across road elements,\nagent interactions and time steps. We evaluate our approach on autonomous\ndriving datasets for behavior prediction, and achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance. Our work demonstrates that formulating the problem of behavior\nprediction in a unified architecture with a masking strategy may allow us to\nhave a single model that can perform multiple motion prediction and planning\nrelated tasks effectively.",

In this work, we proposed to learn a registration optimizer via a\nmulti-scale neural ODE model.

Furthermore, we proposed to learn a\nmodal-independent similarity metric to address image appearance variations\nacross different image contrasts.

          "description": "Contemporary grasp detection approaches employ deep learning to achieve\nrobustness to sensor and object model uncertainty. The two dominant approaches\ndesign either grasp-quality scoring or anchor-based grasp recognition networks.\nThis paper presents a different approach to grasp detection by treating it as\nkeypoint detection. The deep network detects each grasp candidate as a pair of\nkeypoints, convertible to the grasp representation g = {x, y, w, {\\theta}}^T,\nrather than a triplet or quartet of corner points. Decreasing the detection\ndifficulty by grouping keypoints into pairs boosts performance. To further\npromote dependencies between keypoints, the general non-local module is\nincorporated into the proposed learning framework. A final filtering strategy\nbased on discrete and continuous orientation prediction removes false\ncorrespondences and further improves grasp detection performance. GKNet, the\napproach presented here, achieves the best balance of accuracy and speed on the\nCornell and the abridged Jacquard dataset (96.9% and 98.39% at 41.67 and 23.26\nfps). Follow-up experiments on a manipulator evaluate GKNet using 4 types of\ngrasping experiments reflecting different nuisance sources: static grasping,\ndynamic grasping, grasping at varied camera angles, and bin picking. GKNet\noutperforms reference baselines in static and dynamic grasping experiments\nwhile showing robustness to varied camera viewpoints and bin picking\nexperiments. The results confirm the hypothesis that grasp keypoints are an\neffective output representation for deep grasp networks that provide robustness\nto expected nuisance factors.",

In order to rely on\nvirtual tests the employed sensor models have to be validated. For this reason,\nit is necessary to quantify the discrepancy between simulation and reality in\norder to determine whether a certain fidelity is sufficient for a desired\nintended use. There exists no sound method to measure this\nsimulation-to-reality gap of radar perception for autonomous driving. We\naddress this problem by introducing a multi-layered evaluation approach, which\nconsists of a combination of an explicit and an implicit sensor model\nevaluation. The former directly evaluates the realism of the synthetically\ngenerated sensor data, while the latter refers to an evaluation of a downstream\ntarget application. In order to demonstrate the method, we evaluated the\nfidelity of three typical radar model types (ideal, data-driven, ray\ntracing-based) and their applicability for virtually testing radar-based\nmulti-object tracking.

          "description": "Generation of stroke-based non-photorealistic imagery, is an important\nproblem in the computer vision community. As an endeavor in this direction,\nsubstantial recent research efforts have been focused on teaching machines \"how\nto paint\", in a manner similar to a human painter. However, the applicability\nof previous methods has been limited to datasets with little variation in\nposition, scale and saliency of the foreground object. As a consequence, we\nfind that these methods struggle to cover the granularity and diversity\npossessed by real world images. To this end, we propose a Semantic Guidance\npipeline with 1) a bi-level painting procedure for learning the distinction\nbetween foreground and background brush strokes at training time. 2) We also\nintroduce invariance to the position and scale of the foreground object through\na neural alignment model, which combines object localization and spatial\ntransformer networks in an end to end manner, to zoom into a particular\nsemantic instance. 3) The distinguishing features of the in-focus object are\nthen amplified by maximizing a novel guided backpropagation based focus reward.\nThe proposed agent does not require any supervision on human stroke-data and\nsuccessfully handles variations in foreground object attributes, thus,\nproducing much higher quality canvases for the CUB-200 Birds and Stanford\nCars-196 datasets. Finally, we demonstrate the further efficacy of our method\non complex datasets with multiple foreground object instances by evaluating an\nextension of our method on the challenging Virtual-KITTI dataset.

          "description": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a principal diagnostic approach used in\nthe field of radiology to create images of the anatomical and physiological\nstructure of patients. MRI is the prevalent medical imaging practice to find\nabnormalities in soft tissues. Traditionally they are analyzed by a radiologist\nto detect abnormalities in soft tissues, especially the brain. The process of\ninterpreting a massive volume of patient's MRI is laborious. Hence, the use of\nMachine Learning methodologies can aid in detecting abnormalities in soft\ntissues with considerable accuracy. In this research, we have curated a novel\ndataset and developed a framework that uses Deep Transfer Learning to perform a\nmulti-classification of tumors in the brain MRI images. In this paper, we\nadopted the Deep Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet50) architecture\nfor the experiments along with discriminative learning techniques to train the\nmodel. Using the novel dataset and two publicly available MRI brain datasets,\nthis proposed approach attained a classification accuracy of 86.40% on the\ncurated dataset, 93.80% on the Harvard Whole Brain Atlas dataset, and 97.05%\naccuracy on the School of Biomedical Engineering dataset. Results of our\nexperiments significantly demonstrate our proposed framework for transfer\nlearning is a potential and effective method for brain tumor\nmulti-classification tasks.",

          "description": "Despite the continued successes of computationally efficient deep neural\nnetwork architectures for video object detection, performance continually\narrives at the great trilemma of speed versus accuracy versus computational\nresources (pick two). Current attempts to exploit temporal information in video\ndata to overcome this trilemma are bottlenecked by the state-of-the-art in\nobject detection models. We present, a technique which performs video object\ndetection through the use of off-the-shelf object detectors alongside existing\noptical flow based motion estimation techniques in parallel. Through a set of\nexperiments on the benchmark MOT20 dataset, we demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly reduces the baseline latency of any given object detector without\nsacrificing any accuracy. Further latency reduction, up to 25x lower than the\noriginal latency, can be achieved with minimal accuracy loss. MOVEX enables low\nlatency video object detection on common CPU based systems, thus allowing for\nhigh performance video object detection beyond the domain of GPU computing.

          "description": "With the rise in edge-computing devices, there has been an increasing demand\nto deploy energy and resource-efficient models. A large body of research has\nbeen devoted to developing methods that can reduce the size of the model\nconsiderably without affecting the standard metrics such as top-1 accuracy.\nHowever, these pruning approaches tend to result in a significant mismatch in\nother metrics such as fairness across classes and explainability. To combat\nsuch misalignment, we propose a novel multi-part loss function inspired by the\nknowledge-distillation literature. Through extensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across different compression\nalgorithms, architectures, tasks as well as datasets. In particular, we obtain\nup to $4.1\\times$ reduction in the number of prediction mismatches between the\ncompressed and reference models, and up to $5.7\\times$ in cases where the\nreference model makes the correct prediction; all while making no changes to\nthe compression algorithm, and minor modifications to the loss function.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate how inducing simple alignment between the\npredictions of the models naturally improves the alignment on other metrics\nincluding fairness and attributions.

          "description": "For machine agents to successfully interact with humans in real-world\nsettings, they will need to develop an understanding of human mental life.\nIntuitive psychology, the ability to reason about hidden mental variables that\ndrive observable actions, comes naturally to people: even pre-verbal infants\ncan tell agents from objects, expecting agents to act efficiently to achieve\ngoals given constraints. Despite recent interest in machine agents that reason\nabout other agents, it is not clear if such agents learn or hold the core\npsychology principles that drive human reasoning. Inspired by cognitive\ndevelopment studies on intuitive psychology, we present a benchmark consisting\nof a large dataset of procedurally generated 3D animations, AGENT (Action,\nGoal, Efficiency, coNstraint, uTility), structured around four scenarios (goal\npreferences, action efficiency, unobserved constraints, and cost-reward\ntrade-offs) that probe key concepts of core intuitive psychology. We validate\nAGENT with human-ratings, propose an evaluation protocol emphasizing\ngeneralization, and compare two strong baselines built on Bayesian inverse\nplanning and a Theory of Mind neural network. Our results suggest that to pass\nthe designed tests of core intuitive psychology at human levels, a model must\nacquire or have built-in representations of how agents plan, combining utility\ncomputations and core knowledge of objects and physics.",

          "description": "Most neural network pruning methods, such as filter-level and layer-level\nprunings, prune the network model along one dimension (depth, width, or\nresolution) solely to meet a computational budget. However, such a pruning\npolicy often leads to excessive reduction of that dimension, thus inducing a\nhuge accuracy loss. To alleviate this issue, we argue that pruning should be\nconducted along three dimensions comprehensively. For this purpose, our pruning\nframework formulates pruning as an optimization problem. Specifically, it first\ncasts the relationships between a certain model's accuracy and\ndepth/width/resolution into a polynomial regression and then maximizes the\npolynomial to acquire the optimal values for the three dimensions. Finally, the\nmodel is pruned along the three optimal dimensions accordingly. In this\nframework, since collecting too much data for training the regression is very\ntime-costly, we propose two approaches to lower the cost: 1) specializing the\npolynomial to ensure an accurate regression even with less training data; 2)\nemploying iterative pruning and fine-tuning to collect the data faster.\nExtensive experiments show that our proposed algorithm surpasses\nstate-of-the-art pruning algorithms and even neural architecture search-based\nalgorithms.",

          "description": "Though network sparsity emerges as a promising direction to overcome the\ndrastically increasing size of neural networks, it remains an open problem to\nconcurrently maintain model accuracy as well as achieve significant speedups on\ngeneral CPUs. In this paper, we propose one novel concept of $1\\times N$ block\nsparsity pattern (block pruning) to break this limitation. In particular,\nconsecutive $N$ output kernels with the same input channel index are grouped\ninto one block, which serves as a basic pruning granularity of our pruning\npattern. Our $1 \\times N$ sparsity pattern prunes these blocks considered\nunimportant. We also provide a workflow of filter rearrangement that first\nrearranges the weight matrix in the output channel dimension to derive more\ninfluential blocks for accuracy improvements, and then applies similar\nrearrangement to the next-layer weights in the input channel dimension to\nensure correct convolutional operations. Moreover, the output computation after\nour $1 \\times N$ block sparsity can be realized via a parallelized block-wise\nvectorized operation, leading to significant speedups on general CPUs-based\nplatforms. The efficacy of our pruning pattern is proved with experiments on\nILSVRC-2012. For example, in the case of 50% sparsity and $N=4$, our pattern\nobtains about 3.0% improvements over filter pruning in the top-1 accuracy of\nMobileNet-V2. Meanwhile, it obtains 56.04ms inference savings on Cortex-A7 CPU\nover weight pruning. Code is available at https://github.com/lmbxmu/1xN.",

          "description": "In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on training deep neural\nnetworks capable of state-of-the-art performance without the need for the\nexpensive over-parameterization by proposing the concept of In-Time\nOver-Parameterization (ITOP) in sparse training. By starting from a random\nsparse network and continuously exploring sparse connectivities during\ntraining, we can perform an Over-Parameterization in the space-time manifold,\nclosing the gap in the expressibility between sparse training and dense\ntraining. We further use ITOP to understand the underlying mechanism of Dynamic\nSparse Training (DST) and indicate that the benefits of DST come from its\nability to consider across time all possible parameters when searching for the\noptimal sparse connectivity. As long as there are sufficient parameters that\nhave been reliably explored during training, DST can outperform the dense\nneural network by a large margin. We present a series of experiments to support\nour conjecture and achieve the state-of-the-art sparse training performance\nwith ResNet-50 on ImageNet. More impressively, our method achieves dominant\nperformance over the overparameterization-based sparse methods at extreme\nsparsity levels. When trained on CIFAR-100, our method can match the\nperformance of the dense model even at an extreme sparsity (98%).

          "description": "In the last few years, deep learning classifiers have shown promising results\nin image-based medical diagnosis. However, interpreting the outputs of these\nmodels remains a challenge. In cancer diagnosis, interpretability can be\nachieved by localizing the region of the input image responsible for the\noutput, i.e. the location of a lesion. Alternatively, segmentation or detection\nmodels can be trained with pixel-wise annotations indicating the locations of\nmalignant lesions. Unfortunately, acquiring such labels is labor-intensive and\nrequires medical expertise. To overcome this difficulty, weakly-supervised\nlocalization can be utilized. These methods allow neural network classifiers to\noutput saliency maps highlighting the regions of the input most relevant to the\nclassification task (e.g. malignant lesions in mammograms) using only\nimage-level labels (e.g. whether the patient has cancer or not) during\ntraining. When applied to high-resolution images, existing methods produce\nlow-resolution saliency maps. This is problematic in applications in which\nsuspicious lesions are small in relation to the image size. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel neural network architecture to perform weakly-supervised\nsegmentation of high-resolution images. The proposed model selects regions of\ninterest via coarse-level localization, and then performs fine-grained\nsegmentation of those regions. We apply this model to breast cancer diagnosis\nwith screening mammography, and validate it on a large clinically-realistic\ndataset. Measured by Dice similarity score, our approach outperforms existing\nmethods by a large margin in terms of localization performance of benign and\nmalignant lesions, relatively improving the performance by 39.6% and 20.0%,\nrespectively. Code and the weights of some of the models are available at\nhttps://github.com/nyukat/GLAM",

In this work,\na method is proposed to address this challenge by introducing a clustering\ntechnique based on a novel data-adaptive similarity measure, called Random\nForest Activation Pattern (RFAP) similarity. The RFAP similarity is generated\nusing a tree encoding scheme in a Random Forest algorithm. The clustering\nmethod proposed in this work takes into account that there are labelled\nscenarios available and the information from the labelled scenarios can help to\nguide the clustering of unlabelled scenarios. It consists of three steps.\nFirst, a self-supervised Convolutional Neural Network~(CNN) is trained on all\navailable traffic scenarios using a defined self-supervised objective. Second,\nthe CNN is fine-tuned for classification of the labelled scenarios. Third,\nusing the labelled and unlabelled scenarios an iterative optimisation procedure\nis performed for clustering. In the third step at each epoch of the iterative\noptimisation, the CNN is used as a feature generator for an unsupervised Random\nForest. The trained forest, in turn, provides the RFAP similarity to adapt\niteratively the feature generation process implemented by the CNN.

Our S2R-DepthNet (Synthetic to Real DepthNet) can be well\ngeneralized to unseen real-world data directly even though it is only trained\non synthetic data. S2R-DepthNet consists of: a) a Structure Extraction (STE)\nmodule which extracts a domaininvariant structural representation from an image\nby disentangling the image into domain-invariant structure and domain-specific\nstyle components, b) a Depth-specific Attention (DSA) module, which learns\ntask-specific knowledge to suppress depth-irrelevant structures for better\ndepth estimation and generalization, and c) a depth prediction module (DP) to\npredict depth from the depth-specific representation. Without access of any\nreal-world images, our method even outperforms the state-of-the-art\nunsupervised domain adaptation methods which use real-world images of the\ntarget domain for training.

          "description": "Digitalization offers a large number of promising tools for large internal\ncombustion engines such as condition monitoring or condition-based maintenance.\nThis includes the status evaluation of key engine components such as cylinder\nliners, whose inner surfaces are subject to constant wear due to their movement\nrelative to the pistons. Existing state-of-the-art methods for quantifying wear\nrequire disassembly and cutting of the examined liner followed by a\nhigh-resolution microscopic surface depth measurement that quantitatively\nevaluates wear based on bearing load curves (also known as Abbott-Firestone\ncurves). Such reference methods are destructive, time-consuming and costly. The\ngoal of the research presented here is to develop nondestructive yet reliable\nmethods for quantifying the surface condition. A deep-learning framework is\nproposed that allows computation of the bearing load curves from reflection RGB\nimages of the liner surface that can be collected with a wide variety of simple\nimaging devices, without the need to remove and destroy the investigated liner.\nFor this purpose, a convolutional neural network is trained to predict the\nbearing load curve of the corresponding depth profile from the collected RGB\nimages, which in turn can be used for further wear evaluation. Training of the\nnetwork is performed using a custom-built database containing depth profiles\nand reflection images of liner surfaces of large gas engines. The results of\nthe proposed method are visually examined and quantified considering several\nprobabilistic distance metrics and comparison of roughness indicators between\nground truth and model predictions.

Enhancing the\nadversarial robustness of DNNs has gained considerable interest in recent\nyears.

In this\npaper, we propose a new image transformation defense based on error diffusion\nhalftoning, and combine it with adversarial training to defend against\nadversarial examples. Error diffusion halftoning projects an image into a 1-bit\nspace and diffuses quantization error to neighboring pixels.

          "description": "To address the problem of data inconsistencies among different facial\nexpression recognition (FER) datasets, many cross-domain FER methods (CD-FERs)\nhave been extensively devised in recent years. Although each declares to\nachieve superior performance, fair comparisons are lacking due to the\ninconsistent choices of the source/target datasets and feature extractors. In\nthis work, we first analyze the performance effect caused by these inconsistent\nchoices, and then re-implement some well-performing CD-FER and recently\npublished domain adaptation algorithms. We ensure that all these algorithms\nadopt the same source datasets and feature extractors for fair CD-FER\nevaluations. We find that most of the current leading algorithms use\nadversarial learning to learn holistic domain-invariant features to mitigate\ndomain shifts. However, these algorithms ignore local features, which are more\ntransferable across different datasets and carry more detailed content for\nfine-grained adaptation. To address these issues, we integrate graph\nrepresentation propagation with adversarial learning for cross-domain\nholistic-local feature co-adaptation by developing a novel adversarial graph\nrepresentation adaptation (AGRA) framework. Specifically, it first builds two\ngraphs to correlate holistic and local regions within each domain and across\ndifferent domains, respectively. Then, it extracts holistic-local features from\nthe input image and uses learnable per-class statistical distributions to\ninitialize the corresponding graph nodes. Finally, two stacked graph\nconvolution networks (GCNs) are adopted to propagate holistic-local features\nwithin each domain to explore their interaction and across different domains\nfor holistic-local feature co-adaptation. We conduct extensive and fair\nevaluations on several popular benchmarks and show that the proposed AGRA\nframework outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Visual attention is one of the most significant characteristics for selecting\nand understanding the outside redundancy world. The nature of complex scenes\nincludes enormous redundancy. The human vision system can not process all\ninformation simultaneously because of visual information bottleneck. The human\nvisual system mainly focuses on dominant parts of the scenes to reduce the\ninput visual redundancy information. It is commonly known as visual attention\nprediction or visual saliency map. This paper proposes a new psychophysical\nsaliency prediction architecture, WECSF, inspired by human low-level visual\ncortex function. The model consists of opponent color channels, wavelet\ntransform, wavelet energy map, and contrast sensitivity function for extracting\nlow-level image features and maximum approximation to the human visual system.\nThe proposed model is evaluated several datasets, including MIT1003, MIT300,\nTORONTO, SID4VAM and UCF Sports dataset to explain its efficiency. We also\nquantitatively and qualitatively compared the performance of saliency\nprediction with other state-of-the-art models. Our model achieved very stable\nand good performance. Second, we also confirmed that Fourier and\nspectral-inspired saliency prediction models achieved outperformance compared\nto other start-of-the-art non-neural networks and even deep neural network\nmodels on psychophysical synthesis images. Finally, the proposed model also can\nbe applied to spatial-temporal saliency prediction and got better performance.",

          "description": "While neural networks have advanced the frontiers in many applications, they\noften come at a high computational cost. Reducing the power and latency of\nneural network inference is key if we want to integrate modern networks into\nedge devices with strict power and compute requirements. Neural network\nquantization is one of the most effective ways of achieving these savings but\nthe additional noise it induces can lead to accuracy degradation. In this white\npaper, we introduce state-of-the-art algorithms for mitigating the impact of\nquantization noise on the network's performance while maintaining low-bit\nweights and activations. We start with a hardware motivated introduction to\nquantization and then consider two main classes of algorithms: Post-Training\nQuantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware-Training (QAT). PTQ requires no\nre-training or labelled data and is thus a lightweight push-button approach to\nquantization. In most cases, PTQ is sufficient for achieving 8-bit quantization\nwith close to floating-point accuracy. QAT requires fine-tuning and access to\nlabeled training data but enables lower bit quantization with competitive\nresults. For both solutions, we provide tested pipelines based on existing\nliterature and extensive experimentation that lead to state-of-the-art\nperformance for common deep learning models and tasks.",

          "description": "How can neural networks be trained on large-volume temporal data efficiently?\nTo compute the gradients required to update parameters, backpropagation blocks\ncomputations until the forward and backward passes are completed. For temporal\nsignals, this introduces high latency and hinders real-time learning. It also\ncreates a coupling between consecutive layers, which limits model parallelism\nand increases memory consumption. In this paper, we build upon Sideways, which\navoids blocking by propagating approximate gradients forward in time, and we\npropose mechanisms for temporal integration of information based on different\nvariants of skip connections. We also show how to decouple computation and\ndelegate individual neural modules to different devices, allowing distributed\nand parallel training. The proposed Skip-Sideways achieves low latency\ntraining, model parallelism, and, importantly, is capable of extracting\ntemporal features, leading to more stable training and improved performance on\nreal-world action recognition video datasets such as HMDB51, UCF101, and the\nlarge-scale Kinetics-600.

          "description": "Legacy black-and-white photos are riddled with people's nostalgia and\nglorious memories of the past. To better relive the elapsed frozen moments, in\nthis paper, we present a deep exemplar-based image colorization approach named\nColor2Style to resurrect these grayscale image media by filling them with\nvibrant colors. Generally, for exemplar-based colorization, unsupervised and\nunpaired training are usually adopted, due to the difficulty of obtaining input\nand ground truth image pairs. To train an exemplar-based colorization model,\ncurrent algorithms usually strive to achieve two procedures: i) retrieving a\nlarge number of reference images with high similarity in advance, which is\ninevitably time-consuming and tedious; ii) designing complicated modules to\ntransfer the colors of the reference image to the grayscale image, by\ncalculating and leveraging the deep semantic correspondence between them (e.g.,\nnon-local operation). Contrary to the previous methods, we solve and simplify\nthe above two steps in one end-to-end learning procedure. First, we adopt a\nself-augmented self-reference training scheme, where the reference image is\ngenerated by graphical transformations from the original colorful one whereby\nthe training can be formulated in a paired manner. Second, instead of computing\ncomplex and inexplicable correspondence maps, our method exploits a simple yet\neffective deep feature modulation (DFM) module, which injects the color\nembeddings extracted from the reference image into the deep representations of\nthe input grayscale image. Such design is much more lightweight and\nintelligible, achieving appealing performance with real-time processing speed.\nMoreover, our model does not require multifarious loss functions and\nregularization terms like existing methods, but only two widely used loss\nfunctions.

          "description": "In recent years the ubiquitous deployment of AI has posed great concerns in\nregards to algorithmic bias, discrimination, and fairness. Compared to\ntraditional forms of bias or discrimination caused by humans, algorithmic bias\ngenerated by AI is more abstract and unintuitive therefore more difficult to\nexplain and mitigate. A clear gap exists in the current literature on\nevaluating and mitigating bias in pruned neural networks. In this work, we\nstrive to tackle the challenging issues of evaluating, mitigating, and\nexplaining induced bias in pruned neural networks. Our paper makes three\ncontributions. First, we propose two simple yet effective metrics, Combined\nError Variance (CEV) and Symmetric Distance Error (SDE), to quantitatively\nevaluate the induced bias prevention quality of pruned models. Second, we\ndemonstrate that knowledge distillation can mitigate induced bias in pruned\nneural networks, even with unbalanced datasets. Third, we reveal that model\nsimilarity has strong correlations with pruning induced bias, which provides a\npowerful method to explain why bias occurs in pruned neural networks.

Thus, identifying large salt bodies is notoriously tricky\nand is crucial for identifying hydrocarbon reservoirs and drill path planning.\nThis work proposes a Data Augmentation method based on training two generative\nmodels to augment the number of samples in a seismic image dataset for the\nsemantic segmentation of salt bodies. Our method uses deep learning models to\ngenerate pairs of seismic image patches and their respective salt masks for the\nData Augmentation. The first model is a Variational Autoencoder and is\nresponsible for generating patches of salt body masks. The second is a\nConditional Normalizing Flow model, which receives the generated masks as\ninputs and generates the associated seismic image patches. We evaluate the\nproposed method by comparing the performance of ten distinct state-of-the-art\nmodels for semantic segmentation, trained with and without the generated\naugmentations, in a dataset from two synthetic seismic images. The proposed\nmethodology yields an average improvement of 8.57% in the IoU metric across all\ncompared models. The best result is achieved by a DeeplabV3+ model variant,\nwhich presents an IoU score of 95.17% when trained with our augmentations.\nAdditionally, our proposal outperformed six selected data augmentation methods,\nand the most significant improvement in the comparison, of 9.77%, is achieved\nby composing our DA with augmentations from an elastic transformation.

By coherently\ncombining multiple self-attention mechanisms between feature levels for\nscale-awareness, among spatial locations for spatial-awareness, and within\noutput channels for task-awareness, the proposed approach significantly\nimproves the representation ability of object detection heads without any\ncomputational overhead. Further experiments demonstrate that the effectiveness\nand efficiency of the proposed dynamic head on the COCO benchmark. With a\nstandard ResNeXt-101-DCN backbone, we largely improve the performance over\npopular object detectors and achieve a new state-of-the-art at 54.0 AP.\nFurthermore, with latest transformer backbone and extra data, we can push\ncurrent best COCO result to a new record at 60.6 AP. The code will be released\nat https://github.com/microsoft/DynamicHead.",

          "description": "Compressing Deep Neural Network (DNN) models to alleviate the storage and\ncomputation requirements is essential for practical applications, especially\nfor resource limited devices. Although capable of reducing a reasonable amount\nof model parameters, previous unstructured or structured weight pruning methods\ncan hardly truly accelerate inference, either due to the poor hardware\ncompatibility of the unstructured sparsity or due to the low sparse rate of the\nstructurally pruned network. Aiming at reducing both storage and computation,\nas well as preserving the original task performance, we propose a generalized\nweight unification framework at a hardware compatible micro-structured level to\nachieve high amount of compression and acceleration. Weight coefficients of a\nselected micro-structured block are unified to reduce the storage and\ncomputation of the block without changing the neuron connections, which turns\nto a micro-structured pruning special case when all unified coefficients are\nset to zero, where neuron connections (hence storage and computation) are\ncompletely removed. In addition, we developed an effective training framework\nbased on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which converts\nour complex constrained optimization into separately solvable subproblems.\nThrough iteratively optimizing the subproblems, the desired micro-structure can\nbe ensured with high compression ratio and low performance degradation. We\nextensively evaluated our method using a variety of benchmark models and\ndatasets for different applications. Experimental results demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

Providing a method to generate thermal faces from visible\nimages would be highly valuable for the telemedicine community in order to show\nthis medical information. To the best of our knowledge, there are limited works\non visible-to-thermal (VT) face translation, and many current works go the\nopposite direction to generate visible faces from thermal surveillance images\n(TV) for law enforcement applications. As a result, we introduce favtGAN, a VT\nGAN which uses the pix2pix image translation model with an auxiliary sensor\nlabel prediction network for generating thermal faces from visible images.\nSince most TV methods are trained on only one data source drawn from one\nthermal sensor, we combine datasets from faces and cityscapes. These combined\ndata are captured from similar sensors in order to bootstrap the training and\ntransfer learning task, especially valuable because visible-thermal face\ndatasets are limited.

          "description": "Many meta-learning methods are proposed for few-shot detection. However,\nprevious most methods have two main problems, poor detection APs, and strong\nbias because of imbalance and insufficient datasets. Previous works mainly\nalleviate these issues by additional datasets, multi-relation attention\nmechanisms and sub-modules. However, they require more cost. In this work, for\nmeta-learning, we find that the main challenges focus on related or irrelevant\nsemantic features between categories. Therefore, based on semantic features, we\npropose a Top-C classification loss (i.e., TCL-C) for classification task and a\ncategory-based grouping mechanism for category-based meta-features obtained by\nthe meta-model. The TCL-C exploits the true-label prediction and the most\nlikely C-1 false classification predictions to improve detection performance on\nfew-shot classes. According to similar appearance (i.e., visual appearance,\nshape, and limbs etc.) and environment in which objects often appear, the\ncategory-based grouping mechanism splits categories into disjoint groups to\nmake similar semantic features more compact between categories within a group\nand obtain more significant difference between groups, alleviating the strong\nbias problem and further improving detection APs. The whole training consists\nof the base model and the fine-tuning phases. According to grouping mechanism,\nwe group the meta-features vectors obtained by meta-model, so that the\ndistribution difference between groups is obvious, and the one within each\ngroup is less. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC dataset demonstrate that\nours which combines the TCL-C with category-based grouping significantly\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for few-shot detection. Compared\nwith previous competitive baseline, ours improves detection APs by almost 4%\nfor few-shot detection.",

          "description": "Adversarial robustness of deep neural networks is an extensively studied\nproblem in the literature and various methods have been proposed to defend\nagainst adversarial images. However, only a handful of defense methods have\nbeen developed for defending against attacked videos. In this paper, we propose\na novel Over-and-Under complete restoration network for Defending against\nadversarial videos (OUDefend). Most restoration networks adopt an\nencoder-decoder architecture that first shrinks spatial dimension then expands\nit back. This approach learns undercomplete representations, which have large\nreceptive fields to collect global information but overlooks local details. On\nthe other hand, overcomplete representations have opposite properties. Hence,\nOUDefend is designed to balance local and global features by learning those two\nrepresentations. We attach OUDefend to target video recognition models as a\nfeature restoration block and train the entire network end-to-end. Experimental\nresults show that the defenses focusing on images may be ineffective to videos,\nwhile OUDefend enhances robustness against different types of adversarial\nvideos, ranging from additive attacks, multiplicative attacks to physically\nrealizable attacks.

          "description": "Traditional deep learning algorithms often fail to generalize when they are\ntested outside of the domain of training data. Because data distributions can\nchange dynamically in real-life applications once a learned model is deployed,\nin this paper we are interested in single-source domain generalization (SDG)\nwhich aims to develop deep learning algorithms able to generalize from a single\ntraining domain where no information about the test domain is available at\ntraining time. Firstly, we design two simple MNISTbased SDG benchmarks, namely\nMNIST Color SDG-MP and MNIST Color SDG-UP, which highlight the two different\nfundamental SDG issues of increasing difficulties: 1) a class-correlated\npattern in the training domain is missing (SDG-MP), or 2) uncorrelated with the\nclass (SDG-UP), in the testing data domain. This is in sharp contrast with the\ncurrent domain generalization (DG) benchmarks which mix up different\ncorrelation and variation factors and thereby make hard to disentangle success\nor failure factors when benchmarking DG algorithms.

          "description": "Recently, different researchers have found that the gallery composition of a\nface database can induce performance differentials to facial identification\nsystems in which a probe image is compared against up to all stored reference\nimages to reach a biometric decision. This negative effect is referred to as\n\"watchlist imbalance effect\". In this work, we present a method to\ntheoretically estimate said effect for a biometric identification system given\nits verification performance across demographic groups and the composition of\nthe used gallery. Further, we report results for identification experiments on\ndifferently composed demographic subsets, i.e. females and males, of the public\nacademic MORPH database using the open-source ArcFace face recognition system.\nIt is shown that the database composition has a huge impact on performance\ndifferentials in biometric identification systems, even if performance\ndifferentials are less pronounced in the verification scenario.

          "description": "Modern optical satellite sensors enable high-resolution stereo reconstruction\nfrom space. But the challenging imaging conditions when observing the Earth\nfrom space push stereo matching to its limits. In practice, the resulting\ndigital surface models (DSMs) are fairly noisy and often do not attain the\naccuracy needed for high-resolution applications such as 3D city modeling.\nArguably, stereo correspondence based on low-level image similarity is\ninsufficient and should be complemented with a-priori knowledge about the\nexpected surface geometry beyond basic local smoothness. To that end, we\nintroduce ResDepth, a convolutional neural network that learns such an\nexpressive geometric prior from example data. ResDepth refines an initial, raw\nstereo DSM while conditioning the refinement on the images. I.e., it acts as a\nsmart, learned post-processing filter and can seamlessly complement any stereo\nmatching pipeline. In a series of experiments, we find that the proposed method\nconsistently improves stereo DSMs both quantitatively and qualitatively. We\nshow that the prior encoded in the network weights captures meaningful\ngeometric characteristics of urban design, which also generalize across\ndifferent districts and even from one city to another. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthat, by training on a variety of stereo pairs, ResDepth can acquire a\nsufficient degree of invariance against variations in imaging conditions and\nacquisition geometry.",

The handwritten digits of three scripts including Latin, Arabic\nand Kannada are studied to show that multi-task models with reformulation of\nthe individual tasks have shown promising results. In this study a novel way of\nusing the individual tasks predictions was proposed to help classification\nperformance and regularize the different loss for the purpose of the main task.\nThis finding has outperformed the baseline and the conventional multi-task\nlearning models.

RBFF stacks features extracted from the batch\nnormalization layer of a few selected blocks of MobileNetV2, where the\ncandidate blocks are selected based on the characteristics of the ReLU\nactivation layers present in those blocks. The feature vector is then\ncompressed into a low-dimensional feature space using dimension reduction\nalgorithms on which we train a low-cost SVM classifier for the classification\nof the aerial images. We validate our choice of selected features based on the\nsignificance of the extracted features with respect to our classification\npipeline.

          "description": "The growing demand for head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations,\nalong with a global shortage of radiologists, has led to an increase in the\ntime taken to report head MRI scans around the world. For many neurological\nconditions, this delay can result in increased morbidity and mortality. An\nautomated triaging tool could reduce reporting times for abnormal examinations\nby identifying abnormalities at the time of imaging and prioritizing the\nreporting of these scans. In this work, we present a convolutional neural\nnetwork for detecting clinically-relevant abnormalities in\n$\\text{T}_2$-weighted head MRI scans. Using a validated neuroradiology report\nclassifier, we generated a labelled dataset of 43,754 scans from two large UK\nhospitals for model training, and demonstrate accurate classification (area\nunder the receiver operating curve (AUC) = 0.943) on a test set of 800 scans\nlabelled by a team of neuroradiologists. Importantly, when trained on scans\nfrom only a single hospital the model generalized to scans from the other\nhospital ($\\Delta$AUC $\\leq$ 0.02). A simulation study demonstrated that our\nmodel would reduce the mean reporting time for abnormal examinations from 28\ndays to 14 days and from 9 days to 5 days at the two hospitals, demonstrating\nfeasibility for use in a clinical triage environment.",

          "description": "Although much progress has been made recently in 3D face reconstruction, most\nprevious work has been devoted to predicting accurate and fine-grained 3D\nshapes. In contrast, relatively little work has focused on generating\nhigh-fidelity face textures. Compared with the prosperity of photo-realistic 2D\nface image generation, high-fidelity 3D face texture generation has yet to be\nstudied. In this paper, we proposed a novel UV map generation model that\npredicts the UV map from a single face image. The model consists of a UV\nsampler and a UV generator. By selectively sampling the input face image's\npixels and adjusting their relative locations, the UV sampler generates an\nincomplete UV map that could faithfully reconstruct the original face. Missing\ntextures in the incomplete UV map are further full-filled by the UV generator.\nThe training is based on pseudo ground truth blended by the 3DMM texture and\nthe input face texture, thus weakly supervised. To deal with the artifacts in\nthe imperfect pseudo UV map, multiple partial UV map discriminators are\nleveraged.",

          "description": "Timely, accurate and reliable assessment of fetal brain development is\nessential to reduce short and long-term risks to fetus and mother. Fetal MRI is\nincreasingly used for fetal brain assessment. Three key biometric linear\nmeasurements important for fetal brain evaluation are Cerebral Biparietal\nDiameter (CBD), Bone Biparietal Diameter (BBD), and Trans-Cerebellum Diameter\n(TCD), obtained manually by expert radiologists on reference slices, which is\ntime consuming and prone to human error. The aim of this study was to develop a\nfully automatic method computing the CBD, BBD and TCD measurements from fetal\nbrain MRI. The input is fetal brain MRI volumes which may include the fetal\nbody and the mother's abdomen. The outputs are the measurement values and\nreference slices on which the measurements were computed. The method, which\nfollows the manual measurements principle, consists of five stages: 1)\ncomputation of a Region Of Interest that includes the fetal brain with an\nanisotropic 3D U-Net classifier; 2) reference slice selection with a\nConvolutional Neural Network; 3) slice-wise fetal brain structures segmentation\nwith a multiclass U-Net classifier; 4) computation of the fetal brain\nmidsagittal line and fetal brain orientation, and; 5) computation of the\nmeasurements. Experimental results on 214 volumes for CBD, BBD and TCD\nmeasurements yielded a mean $L_1$ difference of 1.55mm, 1.45mm and 1.23mm\nrespectively, and a Bland-Altman 95% confidence interval ($CI_{95}$) of 3.92mm,\n3.98mm and 2.25mm respectively. These results are similar to the manual\ninter-observer variability. The proposed automatic method for computing\nbiometric linear measurements of the fetal brain from MR imaging achieves human\nlevel performance. It has the potential of being a useful method for the\nassessment of fetal brain biometry in normal and pathological cases, and of\nimproving routine clinical practice.",

          "description": "We present a novel direction-aware feature-level frequency decomposition\nnetwork for single image deraining. Compared with existing solutions, the\nproposed network has three compelling characteristics. First, unlike previous\nalgorithms, we propose to perform frequency decomposition at feature-level\ninstead of image-level, allowing both low-frequency maps containing structures\nand high-frequency maps containing details to be continuously refined during\nthe training procedure. Second, we further establish communication channels\nbetween low-frequency maps and high-frequency maps to interactively capture\nstructures from high-frequency maps and add them back to low-frequency maps\nand, simultaneously, extract details from low-frequency maps and send them back\nto high-frequency maps, thereby removing rain streaks while preserving more\ndelicate features in the input image. Third, different from existing algorithms\nusing convolutional filters consistent in all directions, we propose a\ndirection-aware filter to capture the direction of rain streaks in order to\nmore effectively and thoroughly purge the input images of rain streaks. We\nextensively evaluate the proposed approach in three representative datasets and\nexperimental results corroborate our approach consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art deraining algorithms.",

          "description": "Underwater images, in general, suffer from low contrast and high color\ndistortions due to the non-uniform attenuation of the light as it propagates\nthrough the water. In addition, the degree of attenuation varies with the\nwavelength resulting in the asymmetric traversing of colors. Despite the\nprolific works for underwater image restoration (UIR) using deep learning, the\nabove asymmetricity has not been addressed in the respective network\nengineering. As the first novelty, this paper shows that attributing the right\nreceptive field size (context) based on the traversing range of the color\nchannel may lead to a substantial performance gain for the task of UIR.\nFurther, it is important to suppress the irrelevant multi-contextual features\nand increase the representational power of the model. Therefore, as a second\nnovelty, we have incorporated an attentive skip mechanism to adaptively refine\nthe learned multi-contextual features. The proposed framework, called Deep\nWaveNet, is optimized using the traditional pixel-wise and feature-based cost\nfunctions. An extensive set of experiments have been carried out to show the\nefficacy of the proposed scheme over existing best-published literature on\nbenchmark datasets. More importantly, we have demonstrated a comprehensive\nvalidation of enhanced images across various high-level vision tasks, e.g.,\nunderwater image semantic segmentation, and diver's 2D pose estimation.

          "description": "Geometric alignment appears in a variety of applications, ranging from domain\nadaptation, optimal transport, and normalizing flows in machine learning;\noptical flow and learned augmentation in computer vision and deformable\nregistration within biomedical imaging. A recurring challenge is the alignment\nof domains whose topology is not the same; a problem that is routinely ignored,\npotentially introducing bias in downstream analysis. As a first step towards\nsolving such alignment problems, we propose an unsupervised topological\ndifference detection algorithm. The model is based on a conditional variational\nauto-encoder and detects topological anomalies with regards to a reference\nalongside the registration step. We consider both a) topological changes in the\nimage under spatial variation and b) unexpected transformations.

These approaches are\nusually trained to minimise pixel-based losses such as Mean-Squared Error\n(MSE), despite the fact that this type of loss metric does not correlate well\nwith subjective opinions. In this paper, a perceptually-inspired\nsuper-resolution approach (M-SRGAN) is proposed for spatial up-sampling of\ncompressed video using a modified CNN model, which has been trained using a\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) on compressed content with perceptual loss\nfunctions.

More specifically, we demonstrate that one face verification model's\nembeddings (i.e. last--layer activations) can be compared directly to another\nmodel's embeddings after only a rotation or linear transformation, with little\nperformance penalty. This finding is demonstrated using IJB-C 1:1 verification\nacross the combinations of ten modern off-the-shelf CNN-based face verification\nmodels which vary in training dataset, CNN architecture, way of using angular\nloss, or some combination of the 3, and achieve a mean true accept rate of 0.96\nat a false accept rate of 0.01.

Restricting these linear maps to only perform rotation\nproduces a mean true accept rate of 0.91.

          "description": "Most existing works in few-shot learning rely on meta-learning the network on\na large base dataset which is typically from the same domain as the target\ndataset. We tackle the problem of cross-domain few-shot learning where there is\na large shift between the base and target domain. The problem of cross-domain\nfew-shot recognition with unlabeled target data is largely unaddressed in the\nliterature. STARTUP was the first method that tackles this problem using\nself-training. However, it uses a fixed teacher pretrained on a labeled base\ndataset to create soft labels for the unlabeled target samples. As the base\ndataset and unlabeled dataset are from different domains, projecting the target\nimages in the class-domain of the base dataset with a fixed pretrained model\nmight be sub-optimal. We propose a simple dynamic distillation-based approach\nto facilitate unlabeled images from the novel/base dataset. We impose\nconsistency regularization by calculating predictions from the weakly-augmented\nversions of the unlabeled images from a teacher network and matching it with\nthe strongly augmented versions of the same images from a student network. The\nparameters of the teacher network are updated as exponential moving average of\nthe parameters of the student network. We show that the proposed network learns\nrepresentation that can be easily adapted to the target domain even though it\nhas not been trained with target-specific classes during the pretraining phase.\nOur model outperforms the current state-of-the art method by 4.4% for 1-shot\nand 3.6% for 5-shot classification in the BSCD-FSL benchmark, and also shows\ncompetitive performance on traditional in-domain few-shot learning task.

Meanwhile,\nappearance mutations caused by occlusion or similar objects usually lead to the\ninevitable learning of wrong information. To cope with appearance mutations,\nthis paper proposes a novel DCF-based method to enhance the sensitivity and\nresistance to mutations with an adaptive hybrid label, i.e., MSCF. The ideal\nlabel is optimized jointly with the correlation filter and remains temporal\nconsistency. Besides, a novel measurement of mutations called mutation threat\nfactor (MTF) is applied to correct the label dynamically. Considerable\nexperiments are conducted on widely used UAV benchmarks. The results indicate\nthat the performance of MSCF tracker surpasses other 26 state-of-the-art\nDCF-based and deep-based trackers. With a real-time speed of _38 frames/s, the\nproposed approach is sufficient for UAV tracking commissions.",

Current approaches\nfor automated diagnosis of melanoma either use pattern recognition or\nanalytical recognition like ABCDE (asymmetry, border, color, diameter and\nevolving) criterion. In practice however, a differential approach wherein\noutliers (ugly duckling) are detected and used to evaluate nevi/lesions.\nIncorporation of differential recognition in Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD)\nsystems has not been explored but can be beneficial as it can provide a\nclinical justification for the derived decision.

          "description": "Plant species identification is time consuming, costly, and requires lots of\nefforts, and expertise knowledge. In recent, many researchers use deep learning\nmethods to classify plants directly using plant images. While deep learning\nmodels have achieved a great success, the lack of interpretability limit their\nwidespread application. To overcome this, we explore the use of interpretable,\nmeasurable and computer-aided features extracted from plant leaf images. Image\nprocessing is one of the most challenging, and crucial steps in\nfeature-extraction. The purpose of image processing is to improve the leaf\nimage by removing undesired distortion. The main image processing steps of our\nalgorithm involves: i) Convert original image to RGB (Red-Green-Blue) image,\nii) Gray scaling, iii) Gaussian smoothing, iv) Binary thresholding, v) Remove\nstalk, vi) Closing holes, and vii) Resize image. The next step after image\nprocessing is to extract features from plant leaf images. We introduced 52\ncomputationally efficient features to classify plant species. These features\nare mainly classified into four groups as: i) shape-based features, ii)\ncolor-based features, iii) texture-based features, and iv) scagnostic features.\nLength, width, area, texture correlation, monotonicity and scagnostics are to\nname few of them. We explore the ability of features to discriminate the\nclasses of interest under supervised learning and unsupervised learning\nsettings. For that, supervised dimensionality reduction technique, Linear\nDiscriminant Analysis (LDA), and unsupervised dimensionality reduction\ntechnique, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are used to convert and visualize\nthe images from digital-image space to feature space. The results show that the\nfeatures are sufficient to discriminate the classes of interest under both\nsupervised and unsupervised learning settings.",

          "description": "Benefit from large-scale training data, recent advances in Siamese-based\nobject tracking have achieved compelling results on the normal sequences.\nWhilst Siamese-based trackers assume training and test data follow an identical\ndistribution. Suppose there is a set of foggy or rainy test sequences, it\ncannot be guaranteed that the trackers trained on the normal images perform\nwell on the data belonging to other domains. The problem of domain shift among\ntraining and test data has already been discussed in object detection and\nsemantic segmentation areas, which, however, has not been investigated for\nvisual tracking. To this end, based on SiamRPN++, we introduce a Domain\nAdaptive SiamRPN++, namely DASiamRPN++, to improve the cross-domain\ntransferability and robustness of a tracker. Inspired by A-distance theory, we\npresent two domain adaptive modules, Pixel Domain Adaptation (PDA) and Semantic\nDomain Adaptation (SDA). The PDA module aligns the feature maps of template and\nsearch region images to eliminate the pixel-level domain shift caused by\nweather, illumination, etc. The SDA module aligns the feature representations\nof the tracking target's appearance to eliminate the semantic-level domain\nshift. PDA and SDA modules reduce the domain disparity by learning domain\nclassifiers in an adversarial training manner. The domain classifiers enforce\nthe network to learn domain-invariant feature representations. Extensive\nexperiments are performed on the standard datasets of two different domains,\nincluding synthetic foggy and TIR sequences, which demonstrate the\ntransferability and domain adaptability of the proposed tracker.",

          "description": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of adult death in the\nUnited States and worldwide, and for which the coronary angiography procedure\nis the primary gateway for diagnosis and clinical management decisions. The\nstandard-of-care for interpretation of coronary angiograms depends upon ad-hoc\nvisual assessment by the physician operator. However, ad-hoc visual\ninterpretation of angiograms is poorly reproducible, highly variable and bias\nprone. Here we show for the first time that fully-automated angiogram\ninterpretation to estimate coronary artery stenosis is possible using a\nsequence of deep neural network algorithms. The algorithmic pipeline we\ndeveloped--called CathAI--achieves state-of-the art performance across the\nsequence of tasks required to accomplish automated interpretation of\nunselected, real-world angiograms. CathAI (Algorithms 1-2) demonstrated\npositive predictive value, sensitivity and F1 score of >=90% to identify the\nprojection angle overall and >=93% for left or right coronary artery angiogram\ndetection, the primary anatomic structures of interest. To predict obstructive\ncoronary artery stenosis (>=70% stenosis), CathAI (Algorithm 4) exhibited an\narea under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.862 (95% CI:\n0.843-0.880). When externally validated in a healthcare system in another\ncountry, CathAI AUC was 0.869 (95% CI: 0.830-0.907) to predict obstructive\ncoronary artery stenosis. Our results demonstrate that multiple purpose-built\nneural networks can function in sequence to accomplish the complex series of\ntasks required for automated analysis of real-world angiograms. Deployment of\nCathAI may serve to increase standardization and reproducibility in coronary\nstenosis assessment, while providing a robust foundation to accomplish future\ntasks for algorithmic angiographic interpretation.",

          "description": "RGB-Infrared (IR) person re-identification aims to retrieve\nperson-of-interest between heterogeneous modalities, suffering from large\nmodality discrepancy caused by different sensory devices. Existing methods\nmainly focus on global-level modality alignment, whereas neglect sample-level\nmodality divergence to some extent, leading to performance degradation. This\npaper attempts to find RGB-IR ReID solutions from tackling sample-level\nmodality difference, and presents a Geometry-Guided Dual-Alignment learning\nframework (G$^2$DA), which jointly enhances modality-invariance and reinforces\ndiscriminability with human topological structure in features to boost the\noverall matching performance. Specifically, G$^2$DA extracts accurate body part\nfeatures with a pose estimator, serving as a semantic bridge complementing the\nmissing local details in global descriptor. Based on extracted local and global\nfeatures, a novel distribution constraint derived from optimal transport is\nintroduced to mitigate the modality gap in a fine-grained sample-level manner.\nBeyond pair-wise relations across two modalities, it additionally measures the\nstructural similarity of different parts, thus both multi-level features and\ntheir relations are kept consistent in the common feature space. Considering\nthe inherent human-topology information, we further advance a geometry-guided\ngraph learning module to refine each part features, where relevant regions can\nbe emphasized while meaningless ones are suppressed, effectively facilitating\nrobust feature learning.

This article constructs a complete SAR image classifier based on\nunsupervised and supervised learning of SNN by using spike sequences with\ncomplex spatio-temporal information. We firstly expound the spiking neuron\nmodel, the receptive field of SNN, and the construction of spike sequence. Then\nwe put forward an unsupervised learning algorithm based on STDP and a\nsupervised learning algorithm based on gradient descent. The average\nclassification accuracy of single layer and bilayer unsupervised learning SNN\nin three categories images on MSTAR dataset is 80.8\\% and 85.1\\%, respectively.\nFurthermore, the convergent output spike sequences of unsupervised learning can\nbe used as teaching signals. Based on the TensorFlow framework, a single layer\nsupervised learning SNN is built from the bottom, and the classification\naccuracy reaches 90.05\\%. By comparing noise resistance and model parameters\nbetween SNNs and CNNs, the effectiveness and outstanding advantages of SNN are\nverified.

Yet, they suffer intrinsically from poor angular\nresolution, that is an order-of-magnitude worse than camera systems, and are\ntherefore not a capable 3-D imaging solution in isolation. We propose\nMetamoran, a system that combines the complimentary strengths of radar and\ncamera systems to obtain depth images at high azimuthal resolutions at\ndistances of several tens of meters with high accuracy, all from a single fixed\nvantage point. Metamoran enables rich long-range depth imaging outdoors with\napplications to roadside safety infrastructure, surveillance and wide-area\nmapping. Our key insight is to use the high azimuth resolution from cameras\nusing computer vision techniques, including image segmentation and monocular\ndepth estimation, to obtain object shapes and use these as priors for our novel\nspecular beamforming algorithm. We also design this algorithm to work in\ncluttered environments with weak reflections and in partially occluded\nscenarios. We perform a detailed evaluation of Metamoran's depth imaging and\nsensing capabilities in 200 diverse scenes at a major U.S. city. Our evaluation\nshows that Metamoran estimates the depth of an object up to 60~m away with a\nmedian error of 28~cm, an improvement of 13$\\times$ compared to a naive\nradar+camera baseline and 23$\\times$ compared to monocular depth estimation.",

Existing efforts leverage a\nlong training video from each target person to train a subject-specific motion\ntransfer model. However, the scalability of such methods is limited, as each\nmodel can only generate videos for the given target subject, and such training\nvideos are labor-intensive to acquire and process. Few-shot motion transfer\ntechniques, which only require one or a few images from a target, have recently\ndrawn considerable attention. Methods addressing this task generally use either\n2D or explicit 3D representations to transfer motion, and in doing so,\nsacrifice either accurate geometric modeling or the flexibility of an\nend-to-end learned representation. Inspired by the Transformable Bottleneck\nNetwork, which renders novel views and manipulations of rigid objects, we\npropose an approach based on an implicit volumetric representation of the image\ncontent, which can then be spatially manipulated using volumetric flow fields.\nWe address the challenging question of how to aggregate information across\ndifferent body poses, learning flow fields that allow for combining content\nfrom the appropriate regions of input images of highly non-rigid human subjects\nperforming complex motions into a single implicit volumetric representation.\nThis allows us to learn our 3D representation solely from videos of moving\npeople.

          "description": "Machine learning is revolutionizing image-based diagnostics in pathology and\nradiology. ML models have shown promising results in research settings, but\ntheir lack of interoperability has been a major barrier for clinical\nintegration and evaluation. The DICOM a standard specifies Information Object\nDefinitions and Services for the representation and communication of digital\nimages and related information, including image-derived annotations and\nanalysis results. However, the complexity of the standard represents an\nobstacle for its adoption in the ML community and creates a need for software\nlibraries and tools that simplify working with data sets in DICOM format. Here\nwe present the highdicom library, which provides a high-level application\nprogramming interface for the Python programming language that abstracts\nlow-level details of the standard and enables encoding and decoding of\nimage-derived information in DICOM format in a few lines of Python code. The\nhighdicom library ties into the extensive Python ecosystem for image processing\nand machine learning. Simultaneously, by simplifying creation and parsing of\nDICOM-compliant files, highdicom achieves interoperability with the medical\nimaging systems that hold the data used to train and run ML models, and\nultimately communicate and store model outputs for clinical use. We demonstrate\nthrough experiments with slide microscopy and computed tomography imaging,\nthat, by bridging these two ecosystems, highdicom enables developers to train\nand evaluate state-of-the-art ML models in pathology and radiology while\nremaining compliant with the DICOM standard and interoperable with clinical\nsystems at all stages. To promote standardization of ML research and streamline\nthe ML model development and deployment process, we made the library available\nfree and open-source.",

          "description": "Cross-resolution image alignment is a key problem in multiscale gigapixel\nphotography, which requires to estimate homography matrix using images with\nlarge resolution gap. Existing deep homography methods concatenate the input\nimages or features, neglecting the explicit formulation of correspondences\nbetween them, which leads to degraded accuracy in cross-resolution challenges.\nIn this paper, we consider the cross-resolution homography estimation as a\nmultimodal problem, and propose a local transformer network embedded within a\nmultiscale structure to explicitly learn correspondences between the multimodal\ninputs, namely, input images with different resolutions. The proposed local\ntransformer adopts a local attention map specifically for each position in the\nfeature. By combining the local transformer with the multiscale structure, the\nnetwork is able to capture long-short range correspondences efficiently and\naccurately. Experiments on both the MS-COCO dataset and the real-captured\ncross-resolution dataset show that the proposed network outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art feature-based and deep-learning-based homography estimation\nmethods, and is able to accurately align images under $10\\times$ resolution\ngap.",

          "description": "Working memory (WM) is a basic part of human cognition, which plays an\nimportant role in the study of human cognitive load. Among various brain\nimaging techniques, electroencephalography has shown its advantage on easy\naccess and reliability. However, one of the critical challenges is that\nindividual difference may cause the ineffective results, especially when the\nestablished model meets an unfamiliar subject. In this work, we propose a\ncross-subject deep adaptation model with spatial attention (CS-DASA) to\ngeneralize the workload classifications across subjects. First, we transform\ntime-series EEG data into multi-frame EEG images incorporating more\nspatio-temporal information. First, the subject-shared module in CS-DASA\nreceives multi-frame EEG image data from both source and target subjects and\nlearns the common feature representations. Then, in subject-specific module,\nthe maximum mean discrepancy is implemented to measure the domain distribution\ndivergence in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which can add an effective\npenalty loss for domain adaptation. Additionally, the subject-to-subject\nspatial attention mechanism is employed to focus on the most discriminative\nspatial feature in EEG image data. Experiments conducted on a public WM EEG\ndataset containing 13 subjects show that the proposed model is capable of\nachieve better performance than existing state-of-the art methods.",

          "description": "We consider a best arm identification (BAI) problem for stochastic bandits\nwith adversarial corruptions in the fixed-budget setting of T steps. We design\na novel randomized algorithm, Probabilistic Sequential Shrinking($u$)\n(PSS($u$)), which is agnostic to the amount of corruptions. When the amount of\ncorruptions per step (CPS) is below a threshold, PSS($u$) identifies the best\narm or item with probability tending to $1$ as $T\\rightarrow \\infty$.\nOtherwise, the optimality gap of the identified item degrades gracefully with\nthe CPS.We argue that such a bifurcation is necessary. In PSS($u$), the\nparameter $u$ serves to balance between the optimality gap and success\nprobability. The injection of randomization is shown to be essential to\nmitigate the impact of corruptions. To demonstrate this, we design two attack\nstrategies that are applicable to any algorithm. We apply one of them to a\ndeterministic analogue of PSS($u$) known as Successive Halving (SH) by Karnin\net al. (2013). The attack strategy results in a high failure probability for\nSH, but PSS($u$) remains robust. In the absence of corruptions, PSS($2$)'s\nperformance guarantee matches SH's. We show that when the CPS is sufficiently\nlarge, no algorithm can achieve a BAI probability tending to $1$ as\n$T\\rightarrow \\infty$. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical\nfindings.",

          "description": "Probabilistic software analysis aims at quantifying the probability of a\ntarget event occurring during the execution of a program processing uncertain\nincoming data or written itself using probabilistic programming constructs.\nRecent techniques combine symbolic execution with model counting or solution\nspace quantification methods to obtain accurate estimates of the occurrence\nprobability of rare target events, such as failures in a mission-critical\nsystem.

          "description": "The adoption of machine learning in materials science has rapidly transformed\nmaterials property prediction. Hurdles limiting full capitalization of recent\nadvancements in machine learning include the limited development of methods to\nlearn the underlying interactions of multiple elements, as well as the\nrelationships among multiple properties, to facilitate property prediction in\nnew composition spaces. To address these issues, we introduce the Hierarchical\nCorrelation Learning for Multi-property Prediction (H-CLMP) framework that\nseamlessly integrates (i) prediction using only a material's composition, (ii)\nlearning and exploitation of correlations among target properties in\nmulti-target regression, and (iii) leveraging training data from tangential\ndomains via generative transfer learning. The model is demonstrated for\nprediction of spectral optical absorption of complex metal oxides spanning 69\n3-cation metal oxide composition spaces. H-CLMP accurately predicts non-linear\ncomposition-property relationships in composition spaces for which no training\ndata is available, which broadens the purview of machine learning to the\ndiscovery of materials with exceptional properties. This achievement results\nfrom the principled integration of latent embedding learning, property\ncorrelation learning, generative transfer learning, and attention models. The\nbest performance is obtained using H-CLMP with Transfer learning (H-CLMP(T))\nwherein a generative adversarial network is trained on computational density of\nstates data and deployed in the target domain to augment prediction of optical\nabsorption from composition. H-CLMP(T) aggregates multiple knowledge sources\nwith a framework that is well-suited for multi-target regression across the\nphysical sciences.",

          "description": "A common assumption in machine learning is that samples are independently and\nidentically distributed (i.i.d). However, the contributions of different\nsamples are not identical in training. Some samples are difficult to learn and\nsome samples are noisy. The unequal contributions of samples has a considerable\neffect on training performances. Studies focusing on unequal sample\ncontributions (e.g., easy, hard, noisy) in learning usually refer to these\ncontributions as robust machine learning (RML). Weighing and regularization are\ntwo common techniques in RML. Numerous learning algorithms have been proposed\nbut the strategies for dealing with easy/hard/noisy samples differ or even\ncontradict with different learning algorithms. For example, some strategies\ntake the hard samples first, whereas some strategies take easy first.\nConducting a clear comparison for existing RML algorithms in dealing with\ndifferent samples is difficult due to lack of a unified theoretical framework\nfor RML. This study attempts to construct a mathematical foundation for RML\nbased on the bias-variance trade-off theory. A series of definitions and\nproperties are presented and proved. Several classical learning algorithms are\nalso explained and compared. Improvements of existing methods are obtained\nbased on the comparison.

          "description": "We propose a new method in which a generative adversarial network (GAN) is\nused to quantify the uncertainty of forward simulations in the presence of\nobserved data. Previously, a method has been developed which enables GANs to\nmake time series predictions and data assimilation by training a GAN with\nunconditional simulations of a high-fidelity numerical model. After training,\nthe GAN can be used to predict the evolution of the spatial distribution of the\nsimulation states and observed data is assimilated. In this paper, we describe\nthe process required in order to quantify uncertainty, during which no\nadditional simulations of the high-fidelity numerical model are required. These\nmethods take advantage of the adjoint-like capabilities of generative models\nand the ability to simulate forwards and backwards in time. Set within a\nreduced-order model framework for efficiency, we apply these methods to a\ncompartmental model in epidemiology to predict the spread of COVID-19 in an\nidealised town. The results show that the proposed method can efficiently\nquantify uncertainty in the presence of measurements using only unconditional\nsimulations of the high-fidelity numerical model.",

We then develop nested CSMC, an\nefficient proposal distribution for CSMC and prove that nested CSMC is an exact\napproximation to the (intractable) locally optimal proposal. We use nested CSMC\nto define a second objective, VNCSMC which yields tighter lower bounds than\nVCSMC. We show that VCSMC and VNCSMC are computationally efficient and explore\nhigher probability spaces than existing methods on a range of tasks.",

Although these models\noffer streamlined solutions to large problems, they may contain biases and\ntreat groups or individuals unfairly based on protected attributes such as\ngender. In this paper, we introduce several examples of machine learning gender\nbias in practice followed by formalizations of fairness. We provide a survey of\nfairness research by detailing influential pre-processing, in-processing, and\npost-processing bias mitigation algorithms. We then propose an\n\\textup{end-to-end bias mitigation} framework, which employs a fusion of pre-,\nin-, and post-processing methods to leverage the strengths of each individual\ntechnique. We test this method, along with the standard techniques we review,\non a deep neural network to analyze bias mitigation in a deep learning setting.\nWe find that our end-to-end bias mitigation framework outperforms the baselines\nwith respect to several fairness metrics, suggesting its promise as a method\nfor improving fairness. As society increasingly relies on artificial\nintelligence to help in decision-making, addressing gender biases present in\ndeep learning models is imperative.

          "description": "Graph-based Anomaly Detection (GAD) is becoming prevalent due to the powerful\nrepresentation abilities of graphs as well as recent advances in graph mining\ntechniques. These GAD tools, however, expose a new attacking surface,\nironically due to their unique advantage of being able to exploit the relations\namong data. That is, attackers now can manipulate those relations (i.e., the\nstructure of the graph) to allow some target nodes to evade detection. In this\npaper, we exploit this vulnerability by designing a new type of targeted\nstructural poisoning attacks to a representative regression-based GAD system\ntermed OddBall. Specially, we formulate the attack against OddBall as a\nbi-level optimization problem, where the key technical challenge is to\nefficiently solve the problem in a discrete domain. We propose a novel attack\nmethod termed BinarizedAttack based on gradient descent. Comparing to prior\narts, BinarizedAttack can better use the gradient information, making it\nparticularly suitable for solving combinatorial optimization problems.\nFurthermore, we investigate the attack transferability of BinarizedAttack by\nemploying it to attack other representation-learning-based GAD systems. Our\ncomprehensive experiments demonstrate that BinarizedAttack is very effective in\nenabling target nodes to evade graph-based anomaly detection tools with limited\nattackers' budget, and in the black-box transfer attack setting,\nBinarizedAttack is also tested effective and in particular, can significantly\nchange the node embeddings learned by the GAD systems.

In\nthis paper, we show that the Max-Margin loss can only be consistent to the\nclassification task under highly restrictive assumptions on the discrete loss\nmeasuring the error between outputs. These conditions are satisfied by\ndistances defined in tree graphs, for which we prove consistency, thus being\nthe first losses shown to be consistent for Max-Margin beyond the binary\nsetting. We finally address these limitations by correcting the concept of\nMax-Margin and introducing the Restricted-Max-Margin, where the maximization of\nthe loss-augmented scores is maintained, but performed over a subset of the\noriginal domain. The resulting loss is also a generalization of the binary\nsupport vector machine and it is consistent under milder conditions on the\ndiscrete loss.",

          "description": "In adversarial training (AT), the main focus has been the objective and\noptimizer while the model has been less studied, so that the models being used\nare still those classic ones in standard training (ST). Classic network\narchitectures (NAs) are generally worse than searched NAs in ST, which should\nbe the same in AT. In this paper, we argue that NA and AT cannot be handled\nindependently, since given a dataset, the optimal NA in ST would be no longer\noptimal in AT. That being said, AT is time-consuming itself; if we directly\nsearch NAs in AT over large search spaces, the computation will be practically\ninfeasible. Thus, we propose a diverse-structured network (DS-Net), to\nsignificantly reduce the size of the search space: instead of low-level\noperations, we only consider predefined atomic blocks, where an atomic block is\na time-tested building block like the residual block. There are only a few\natomic blocks and thus we can weight all atomic blocks rather than find the\nbest one in a searched block of DS-Net, which is an essential trade-off between\nexploring diverse structures and exploiting the best structures. Empirical\nresults demonstrate the advantages of DS-Net, i.e., weighting the atomic\nblocks.",

We tackle this challenge by introducing a novel\nvariational structured approximation inspired by the Bayesian interpretation of\nDropout regularization. Concretely, we focus on the inflexibility of the\nfactorized structure in Dropout posterior and then propose an improved method\ncalled Variational Structured Dropout (VSD). VSD employs an orthogonal\ntransformation to learn a structured representation on the variational noise\nand consequently induces statistical dependencies in the approximate posterior.\nTheoretically, VSD successfully addresses the pathologies of previous\nVariational Dropout methods and thus offers a standard Bayesian justification.\nWe further show that VSD induces an adaptive regularization term with several\ndesirable properties which contribute to better generalization. Finally, we\nconduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of VSD over state-of-the-art variational methods on predictive\naccuracy, uncertainty estimation, and out-of-distribution detection.",

Our solution relies on\ndesigning a partitioner that breaks the space into smaller regions, each having\na simpler distribution, and training a different generator for each partition.\nThis is done in an unsupervised manner without requiring any labels.\n\nWe formulate two desired criteria for the space partitioner that aid the\ntraining of our mixture of generators: 1) to produce connected partitions and\n2) provide a proxy of distance between partitions and data samples, along with\na direction for reducing that distance. These criteria are developed to avoid\nproducing samples from places with non-existent data density, and also\nfacilitate training by providing additional direction to the generators. We\ndevelop theoretical constraints for a space partitioner to satisfy the above\ncriteria.

          "description": "Despite its best performance in image denoising, the supervised deep\ndenoising methods require paired noise-clean data, which are often unavailable.\nTo address this challenge, Noise2Noise was designed based on the fact that\npaired noise-clean images can be replaced by paired noise-noise images that are\neasier to collect. However, in many scenarios the collection of paired\nnoise-noise images is still impractical. To bypass labeled images, Noise2Void\nmethods predict masked pixels from their surroundings with single noisy images\nonly and give improved denoising results that still need improvements. An\nobservation on classic denoising methods is that non-local mean (NLM) outcomes\nare typically superior to locally denoised results. In contrast, Noise2Void and\nits variants do not utilize self-similarities in an image as the NLM-based\nmethods do. Here we propose Noise2Sim, an NLM-inspired self-learning method for\nimage denoising. Specifically, Noise2Sim leverages the self-similarity of image\npixels to train the denoising network, requiring single noisy images only. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that Noise2Sim tends to be equivalent to Noise2Noise\nunder mild conditions. To efficiently manage the computational burden for\nglobally searching similar pixels, we design a two-step procedure to provide\ndata for Noise2Sim training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority\nof Noise2Sim on common benchmark datasets.",

          "description": "Representation learning on user-item graph for recommendation has evolved\nfrom using single ID or interaction history to exploiting higher-order\nneighbors. This leads to the success of graph convolution networks (GCNs) for\nrecommendation such as PinSage and LightGCN. Despite effectiveness, we argue\nthat they suffer from two limitations: (1) high-degree nodes exert larger\nimpact on the representation learning, deteriorating the recommendations of\nlow-degree (long-tail) items; and (2) representations are vulnerable to noisy\ninteractions, as the neighborhood aggregation scheme further enlarges the\nimpact of observed edges.\n\nIn this work, we explore self-supervised learning on user-item graph, so as\nto improve the accuracy and robustness of GCNs for recommendation. The idea is\nto supplement the classical supervised task of recommendation with an auxiliary\nself-supervised task, which reinforces node representation learning via\nself-discrimination. Specifically, we generate multiple views of a node,\nmaximizing the agreement between different views of the same node compared to\nthat of other nodes. We devise three operators to generate the views -- node\ndropout, edge dropout, and random walk -- that change the graph structure in\ndifferent manners. We term this new learning paradigm as\n\\textit{Self-supervised Graph Learning} (SGL), implementing it on the\nstate-of-the-art model LightGCN. Through theoretical analyses, we find that SGL\nhas the ability of automatically mining hard negatives. Empirical studies on\nthree benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SGL, which improves\nthe recommendation accuracy, especially on long-tail items, and the robustness\nagainst interaction noises. Our implementations are available at\n\\url{https://github.com/wujcan/SGL}.",

          "description": "Sleep disorder diagnosis relies on the analysis of polysomnography (PSG)\nrecords. As a preliminary step of this examination, sleep stages are\nsystematically determined. In practice, sleep stage classification relies on\nthe visual inspection of 30-second epochs of polysomnography signals. Numerous\nautomatic approaches have been developed to replace this tedious and expensive\ntask. Although these methods demonstrated better performance than human sleep\nexperts on specific datasets, they remain largely unused in sleep clinics. The\nmain reason is that each sleep clinic uses a specific PSG montage that most\nautomatic approaches cannot handle out-of-the-box. Moreover, even when the PSG\nmontage is compatible, publications have shown that automatic approaches\nperform poorly on unseen data with different demographics. To address these\nissues, we introduce RobustSleepNet, a deep learning model for automatic sleep\nstage classification able to handle arbitrary PSG montages. We trained and\nevaluated this model in a leave-one-out-dataset fashion on a large corpus of 8\nheterogeneous sleep staging datasets to make it robust to demographic changes.\nWhen evaluated on an unseen dataset, RobustSleepNet reaches 97% of the F1 of a\nmodel explicitly trained on this dataset. Hence, RobustSleepNet unlocks the\npossibility to perform high-quality out-of-the-box automatic sleep staging with\nany clinical setup. We further show that finetuning RobustSleepNet, using a\npart of the unseen dataset, increases the F1 by 2% when compared to a model\ntrained specifically for this dataset. Therefore, finetuning might be used to\nreach a state-of-the-art level of performance on a specific population.",

Next, we show that the solution to the PDE converges in the\ntraining time to a zero-loss solution.

An\nongoing challenge in the environmental sciences is transferring knowledge from\nmonitored sites to unmonitored sites. Here, we demonstrate a novel transfer\nlearning framework that accurately predicts depth-specific temperature in\nunmonitored lakes (targets) by borrowing models from well-monitored lakes\n(sources). This method, Meta Transfer Learning (MTL), builds a meta-learning\nmodel to predict transfer performance from candidate source models to targets\nusing lake attributes and candidates' past performance. We constructed source\nmodels at 145 well-monitored lakes using calibrated process-based modeling (PB)\nand a recently developed approach called process-guided deep learning (PGDL).\nWe applied MTL to either PB or PGDL source models (PB-MTL or PGDL-MTL,\nrespectively) to predict temperatures in 305 target lakes treated as\nunmonitored in the Upper Midwestern United States. We show significantly\nimproved performance relative to the uncalibrated process-based General Lake\nModel, where the median RMSE for the target lakes is $2.52^{\\circ}C$. PB-MTL\nyielded a median RMSE of $2.43^{\\circ}C$; PGDL-MTL yielded $2.16^{\\circ}C$; and\na PGDL-MTL ensemble of nine sources per target yielded $1.88^{\\circ}C$. For\nsparsely monitored target lakes, PGDL-MTL often outperformed PGDL models\ntrained on the target lakes themselves. Differences in maximum depth between\nthe source and target were consistently the most important predictors.

First, most RL methods require intensive data from the exploration\nof the environment to achieve satisfactory performance. Second, the use of\nneural networks in RL renders it hard to interpret the internals of the system\nin a way that humans can understand. To address these two challenges, we\npropose a framework that enables an RL agent to reason over its exploration\nprocess and distill high-level knowledge for effectively guiding its future\nexplorations. Specifically, we propose a novel RL algorithm that learns\nhigh-level knowledge in the form of a finite reward automaton by using the L*\nlearning algorithm. We prove that in episodic RL, a finite reward automaton can\nexpress any non-Markovian bounded reward functions with finitely many reward\nvalues and approximate any non-Markovian bounded reward function (with\ninfinitely many reward values) with arbitrary precision. We also provide a\nlower bound for the episode length such that the proposed RL approach almost\nsurely converges to an optimal policy in the limit. We test this approach on\ntwo RL environments with non-Markovian reward functions, choosing a variety of\ntasks with increasing complexity for each environment. We compare our algorithm\nwith the state-of-the-art RL algorithms for non-Markovian reward functions,\nsuch as Joint Inference of Reward machines and Policies for RL (JIRP), Learning\nReward Machine (LRM), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO2).

          "description": "Despite the great progress made by deep neural networks in the semantic\nsegmentation task, traditional neural-networkbased methods typically suffer\nfrom a shortage of large amounts of pixel-level annotations. Recent progress in\nfewshot semantic segmentation tackles the issue by only a few pixel-level\nannotated examples. However, these few-shot approaches cannot easily be applied\nto multi-way or weak annotation settings. In this paper, we advance the\nfew-shot segmentation paradigm towards a scenario where image-level annotations\nare available to help the training process of a few pixel-level annotations.\nOur key idea is to learn a better prototype representation of the class by\nfusing the knowledge from the image-level labeled data. Specifically, we\npropose a new framework, called PAIA, to learn the class prototype\nrepresentation in a metric space by integrating image-level annotations.\nFurthermore, by considering the uncertainty of pseudo-masks, a distilled soft\nmasked average pooling strategy is designed to handle distractions in\nimage-level annotations. Extensive empirical results on two datasets show\nsuperior performance of PAIA.",

Existing methods for agent\nmodelling commonly assume knowledge of the local observations and chosen\nactions of the modelled agents during execution. To eliminate this assumption,\nwe extract representations from the local information of the controlled agent\nusing encoder-decoder architectures. Using the observations and actions of the\nmodelled agents during training, our models learn to extract representations\nabout the modelled agents conditioned only on the local observations of the\ncontrolled agent. The representations are used to augment the controlled\nagent's decision policy which is trained via deep reinforcement learning; thus,\nduring execution, the policy does not require access to other agents'\ninformation. We provide a comprehensive evaluation and ablations studies in\ncooperative, competitive and mixed multi-agent environments, showing that our\nmethod achieves significantly higher returns than baseline methods which do not\nuse the learned representations.",

          "description": "Neural networks are increasingly used in environmental science applications.\nFurthermore, neural network models are trained by minimizing a loss function,\nand it is crucial to choose the loss function very carefully for environmental\nscience applications, as it determines what exactly is being optimized.\nStandard loss functions do not cover all the needs of the environmental\nsciences, which makes it important for scientists to be able to develop their\nown custom loss functions so that they can implement many of the classic\nperformance measures already developed in environmental science, including\nmeasures developed for spatial model verification. However, there are very few\nresources available that cover the basics of custom loss function development\ncomprehensively, and to the best of our knowledge none that focus on the needs\nof environmental scientists. This document seeks to fill this gap by providing\na guide on how to write custom loss functions targeted toward environmental\nscience applications. Topics include the basics of writing custom loss\nfunctions, common pitfalls, functions to use in loss functions, examples such\nas fractions skill score as loss function, how to incorporate physical\nconstraints, discrete and soft discretization, and concepts such as focal,\nrobust, and adaptive loss. While examples are currently provided in this guide\nfor Python with Keras and the TensorFlow backend, the basic concepts also apply\nto other environments, such as Python with PyTorch. Similarly, while the sample\nloss functions provided here are from meteorology, these are just examples of\nhow to create custom loss functions. Other fields in the environmental sciences\nhave very similar needs for custom loss functions, e.g., for evaluating spatial\nforecasts effectively, and the concepts discussed here can be applied there as\nwell.

Each\ncomposition may introduce an additional expectation. The series of expectations\nmay be nested. Stochastic compositional optimization is gaining popularity in\napplications such as reinforcement learning and meta learning. This paper\npresents a new Stochastically Corrected Stochastic Compositional gradient\nmethod (SCSC). SCSC runs in a single-time scale with a single loop, uses a\nfixed batch size, and guarantees to converge at the same rate as the stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD) method for non-compositional stochastic optimization.\nThis is achieved by making a careful improvement to a popular stochastic\ncompositional gradient method. It is easy to apply SGD-improvement techniques\nto accelerate SCSC. This helps SCSC achieve state-of-the-art performance for\nstochastic compositional optimization. In particular, we apply Adam to SCSC,\nand the exhibited rate of convergence matches that of the original Adam on\nnon-compositional stochastic optimization.

We further require the probability of the \\emph{estimation error} to\ndecay either exponentially or sub-exponentially fast (corresponding\nrespectively to the large and moderate deviations regimes in information theory\nparlance). Based on the training sequences as well as the test sequence\nconsisting of a single change-point, we design a change-point estimator and\nfurther show that this estimator is optimal by establishing matching (strong)\nconverses.

We evaluate Grammformers on code completion for C# and Python and\nshow that it generates 10-50% more accurate sketches compared to traditional\ngenerative models and 37-50% longer sketches compared to sketch-generating\nbaselines trained with similar techniques.",

          "description": "Noise contrastive learning is a popular technique for unsupervised\nrepresentation learning. In this approach, a representation is obtained via\nreduction to supervised learning, where given a notion of semantic similarity,\nthe learner tries to distinguish a similar (positive) example from a collection\nof random (negative) examples. The success of modern contrastive learning\npipelines relies on many parameters such as the choice of data augmentation,\nthe number of negative examples, and the batch size; however, there is limited\nunderstanding as to how these parameters interact and affect downstream\nperformance. We focus on disambiguating the role of one of these parameters:\nthe number of negative examples. Theoretically, we show the existence of a\ncollision-coverage trade-off suggesting that the optimal number of negative\nexamples should scale with the number of underlying concepts in the data.\nEmpirically, we scrutinize the role of the number of negatives in both NLP and\nvision tasks. In the NLP task, we find that the results broadly agree with our\ntheory, while our vision experiments are murkier with performance sometimes\neven being insensitive to the number of negatives. We discuss plausible\nexplanations for this behavior and suggest future directions to better align\ntheory and practice.",

          "description": "Despite the significant advances in deep learning over the past decade, a\nmajor challenge that limits the wide-spread adoption of deep learning has been\ntheir fragility to adversarial attacks. This sensitivity to making erroneous\npredictions in the presence of adversarially perturbed data makes deep neural\nnetworks difficult to adopt for certain real-world, mission-critical\napplications. While much of the research focus has revolved around adversarial\nexample creation and adversarial hardening, the area of performance measures\nfor assessing adversarial robustness is not well explored. Motivated by this,\nthis study presents the concept of residual error, a new performance measure\nfor not only assessing the adversarial robustness of a deep neural network at\nthe individual sample level, but also can be used to differentiate between\nadversarial and non-adversarial examples to facilitate for adversarial example\ndetection. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid model for approximating the\nresidual error in a tractable manner. Experimental results using the case of\nimage classification demonstrates the effectiveness and efficacy of the\nproposed residual error metric for assessing several well-known deep neural\nnetwork architectures. These results thus illustrate that the proposed measure\ncould be a useful tool for not only assessing the robustness of deep neural\nnetworks used in mission-critical scenarios, but also in the design of\nadversarially robust models.",

          "description": "The inverse Potts problem to infer a Boltzmann distribution for homologous\nprotein sequences from their single-site and pairwise amino acid frequencies\nrecently attracts a great deal of attention in the studies of protein structure\nand evolution. We study regularization and learning methods and how to tune\nregularization parameters to correctly infer interactions in Boltzmann machine\nlearning. Using $L_2$ regularization for fields, group $L_1$ for couplings is\nshown to be very effective for sparse couplings in comparison with $L_2$ and\n$L_1$. Two regularization parameters are tuned to yield equal values for both\nthe sample and ensemble averages of evolutionary energy. Both averages smoothly\nchange and converge, but their learning profiles are very different between\nlearning methods. The Adam method is modified to make stepsize proportional to\nthe gradient for sparse couplings and to use a soft-thresholding function for\ngroup $L_1$. It is shown by first inferring interactions from protein sequences\nand then from Monte Carlo samples that the fields and couplings can be well\nrecovered, but that recovering the pairwise correlations in the resolution of a\ntotal energy is harder for the natural proteins than for the protein-like\nsequences. Selective temperature for folding/structural constrains in protein\nevolution is also estimated.",

In this paper, we present an approach to on-device based ASR\npersonalization with very small amounts of speaker-specific data.

We infer these 3D visual scene feature maps from RGB\nimages of the scene via view prediction: when the generated 3D scene feature\nmap is neurally projected from a camera viewpoint, it should match the\ncorresponding RGB image. We present generative models that condition on the\ndependency tree of an utterance and generate a corresponding visual 3D feature\nmap as well as reason about its plausibility, and detector models that\ncondition on both the dependency tree of an utterance and a related image and\nlocalize the object referents in the 3D feature map inferred from the image.\nOur model outperforms models of language and vision that associate language\nwith 2D CNN activations or 2D images by a large margin in a variety of tasks,\nsuch as, classifying plausibility of utterances, detecting referential\nexpressions, and supplying rewards for trajectory optimization of object\nplacement policies from language instructions. We perform numerous ablations\nand show the improved performance of our detectors is due to its better\ngeneralization across camera viewpoints and lack of object interferences in the\ninferred 3D feature space, and the improved performance of our generators is\ndue to their ability to spatially reason about objects and their configurations\nin 3D when mapping from language to scenes.",

Local explainer models have recently been introduced to\nexplain the predictions of complex machine learning models at the instance\nlevel. In this paper, we propose Local Rule-based Model Interpretability with\nk-optimal Associations (LoRMIkA), a novel model-agnostic approach that obtains\nk-optimal association rules from a neighbourhood of the instance to be\nexplained. Compared with other rule-based approaches in the literature, we\nargue that the most predictive rules are not necessarily the rules that provide\nthe best explanations. Consequently, the LoRMIkA framework provides a flexible\nway to obtain predictive and interesting rules. It uses an efficient search\nalgorithm guaranteed to find the k-optimal rules with respect to objectives\nsuch as confidence, lift, leverage, coverage, and support. It also provides\nmultiple rules which explain the decision and counterfactual rules, which give\nindications for potential changes to obtain different outputs for given\ninstances.

Although we have seen considerable progress over the years in\nlearning rule-based theories, all state-of-the-art learners still learn\ndescriptions that directly relate the input features to the target concept. In\nthe simplest case, concept learning, this is a disjunctive normal form (DNF)\ndescription of the positive class. While it is clear that this is sufficient\nfrom a logical point of view because every logical expression can be reduced to\nan equivalent DNF expression, it could nevertheless be the case that more\nstructured representations, which form deep theories by forming intermediate\nconcepts, could be easier to learn, in very much the same way as deep neural\nnetworks are able to outperform shallow networks, even though the latter are\nalso universal function approximators. In this paper, we empirically compare\ndeep and shallow rule learning with a uniform general algorithm, which relies\non greedy mini-batch based optimization.

          "description": "Inspired by its success in natural language processing and computer vision,\npre-training has attracted substantial attention in cheminformatics and\nbioinformatics, especially for molecule based tasks. A molecule can be\nrepresented by either a graph (where atoms are connected by bonds) or a SMILES\nsequence (where depth-first-search is applied to the molecular graph with\nspecific rules). Existing works on molecule pre-training use either graph\nrepresentations only or SMILES representations only. In this work, we propose\nto leverage both the representations and design a new pre-training algorithm,\ndual-view molecule pre-training (briefly, DMP), that can effectively combine\nthe strengths of both types of molecule representations. The model of DMP\nconsists of two branches: a Transformer branch that takes the SMILES sequence\nof a molecule as input, and a GNN branch that takes a molecular graph as input.\nThe training of DMP contains three tasks: (1) predicting masked tokens in a\nSMILES sequence by the Transformer branch, (2) predicting masked atoms in a\nmolecular graph by the GNN branch, and (3) maximizing the consistency between\nthe two high-level representations output by the Transformer and GNN branches\nseparately. After pre-training, we can use either the Transformer branch (this\none is recommended according to empirical results), the GNN branch, or both for\ndownstream tasks. DMP is tested on nine molecular property prediction tasks and\nachieves state-of-the-art performances on seven of them. Furthermore, we test\nDMP on three retrosynthesis tasks and achieve state-of-the-result on the\nUSPTO-full dataset. Our code will be released soon.",

Recent works empirically demonstrate that adversarial\ntraining in the source data can improve the ability of models to transfer to\nnew domains. However, why this happens is not known. In this paper, we provide\na theoretical model to rigorously analyze how adversarial training helps\ntransfer learning. We show that adversarial training in the source data\ngenerates provably better representations, so fine-tuning on top of this\nrepresentation leads to a more accurate predictor of the target data. We\nfurther demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that semi-supervised\nlearning in the source data can also improve transfer learning by similarly\nimproving the representation. Moreover, performing adversarial training on top\nof semi-supervised learning can further improve transferability, suggesting\nthat the two approaches have complementary benefits on representations.

          "description": "In online reinforcement learning (RL), efficient exploration remains\nparticularly challenging in high-dimensional environments with sparse rewards.\nIn low-dimensional environments, where tabular parameterization is possible,\ncount-based upper confidence bound (UCB) exploration methods achieve minimax\nnear-optimal rates. However, it remains unclear how to efficiently implement\nUCB in realistic RL tasks that involve non-linear function approximation. To\naddress this, we propose a new exploration approach via \\textit{maximizing} the\ndeviation of the occupancy of the next policy from the explored regions. We add\nthis term as an adaptive regularizer to the standard RL objective to balance\nexploration vs. exploitation. We pair the new objective with a provably\nconvergent algorithm, giving rise to a new intrinsic reward that adjusts\nexisting bonuses. The proposed intrinsic reward is easy to implement and\ncombine with other existing RL algorithms to conduct exploration. As a proof of\nconcept, we evaluate the new intrinsic reward on tabular examples across a\nvariety of model-based and model-free algorithms, showing improvements over\ncount-only exploration strategies.

Here in this paper, to address the two challenges, we propose a\nSelf-supervised Incremental deep Graph learning model (SIEGE), for the phishing\nscam detection problem on Ethereum. In our model, two pretext tasks designed\nfrom spatial and temporal perspectives help us effectively learn useful node\nembedding from the huge amount of unlabelled transaction data.

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are effective in solving many real-world\nproblems. Larger DNN models usually exhibit better quality (e.g., accuracy) but\ntheir excessive computation results in long training and inference time. Model\nsparsification can reduce the computation and memory cost while maintaining\nmodel quality. Most existing sparsification algorithms unidirectionally remove\nweights, while others randomly or greedily explore a small subset of weights in\neach layer. The inefficiency of the algorithms reduces the achievable sparsity\nlevel. In addition, many algorithms still require pre-trained dense models and\nthus suffer from large memory footprint and long training time. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel scheduled grow-and-prune (GaP) methodology without\npre-training the dense models. It addresses the shortcomings of the previous\nworks by repeatedly growing a subset of layers to dense and then pruning back\nto sparse after some training. Experiments have shown that such models can\nmatch or beat the quality of highly optimized dense models at 80% sparsity on a\nvariety of tasks, such as image classification, objective detection, 3D object\npart segmentation, and translation. They also outperform other state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) pruning methods, including pruning from pre-trained dense models.

          "description": "This paper addresses the problem of policy selection in domains with abundant\nlogged data, but with a very restricted interaction budget. Solving this\nproblem would enable safe evaluation and deployment of offline reinforcement\nlearning policies in industry, robotics, and healthcare domain among others.\nSeveral off-policy evaluation (OPE) techniques have been proposed to assess the\nvalue of policies using only logged data. However, there is still a big gap\nbetween the evaluation by OPE and the full online evaluation in the real\nenvironment. To reduce this gap, we introduce a novel \\emph{active offline\npolicy selection} problem formulation, which combined logged data and limited\nonline interactions to identify the best policy. We rely on the advances in OPE\nto warm start the evaluation. We build upon Bayesian optimization to\niteratively decide which policies to evaluate in order to utilize the limited\nenvironment interactions wisely. Many candidate policies could be proposed,\nthus, we focus on making our approach scalable and introduce a kernel function\nto model similarity between policies. We use several benchmark environments to\nshow that the proposed approach improves upon state-of-the-art OPE estimates\nand fully online policy evaluation with limited budget. Additionally, we show\nthat each component of the proposed method is important, it works well with\nvarious number and quality of OPE estimates and even with a large number of\ncandidate policies.",

          "description": "This book develops an effective theory approach to understanding deep neural\nnetworks of practical relevance. Beginning from a first-principles\ncomponent-level picture of networks, we explain how to determine an accurate\ndescription of the output of trained networks by solving layer-to-layer\niteration equations and nonlinear learning dynamics. A main result is that the\npredictions of networks are described by nearly-Gaussian distributions, with\nthe depth-to-width aspect ratio of the network controlling the deviations from\nthe infinite-width Gaussian description. We explain how these effectively-deep\nnetworks learn nontrivial representations from training and more broadly\nanalyze the mechanism of representation learning for nonlinear models. From a\nnearly-kernel-methods perspective, we find that the dependence of such models'\npredictions on the underlying learning algorithm can be expressed in a simple\nand universal way. To obtain these results, we develop the notion of\nrepresentation group flow (RG flow) to characterize the propagation of signals\nthrough the network. By tuning networks to criticality, we give a practical\nsolution to the exploding and vanishing gradient problem. We further explain\nhow RG flow leads to near-universal behavior and lets us categorize networks\nbuilt from different activation functions into universality classes.\nAltogether, we show that the depth-to-width ratio governs the effective model\ncomplexity of the ensemble of trained networks. By using information-theoretic\ntechniques, we estimate the optimal aspect ratio at which we expect the network\nto be practically most useful and show how residual connections can be used to\npush this scale to arbitrary depths. With these tools, we can learn in detail\nabout the inductive bias of architectures, hyperparameters, and optimizers.",

A popular data-driven method to detect incipient failures and\nanomalies is the training of normal behaviour models by applying a machine\nlearning technique like feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) or extreme learning\nmachines (ELM). However, the performance of any of these modelling techniques\ncan be deteriorated by the unexpected rise of non-stationarities in the dynamic\nenvironment in which industrial assets operate. This unpredictable statistical\nchange in the measured variable is known as concept drift. In this article a\nwind turbine maintenance case is presented, where non-stationarities of various\nkinds can happen unexpectedly. Such concept drift events are desired to be\ndetected by means of statistical detectors and window-based approaches.\nHowever, in real complex systems, concept drifts are not as clear and evident\nas in artificially generated datasets. In order to evaluate the effectiveness\nof current drift detectors and also to design an appropriate novel technique\nfor this specific industrial application, it is essential to dispose beforehand\nof a characterization of the existent drifts. Under the lack of information in\nthis regard, a methodology for labelling concept drift events in the lifetime\nof wind turbines is proposed. This methodology will facilitate the creation of\na drift database that will serve both as a training ground for concept drift\ndetectors and as a valuable information to enhance the knowledge about\nmaintenance of complex systems.",

First,\nmost existing vertical federated learning methods have a strong assumption that\nat least one party holds the complete set of labels of all data samples, while\nthis assumption is not satisfied in many practical scenarios, where labels are\nhorizontally partitioned and the parties only hold partial labels. Existing\nvertical federated learning methods can only utilize partial labels, which may\nlead to inadequate model update in end-to-end backpropagation. Second,\ncomputational and communication resources vary in parties. Some parties with\nlimited computational and communication resources will become the stragglers\nand slow down the convergence of training. Such straggler problem will be\nexaggerated in the scenarios of horizontally partitioned labels in vertical\nfederated learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel vertical\nfederated learning framework named Cascade Vertical Federated Learning (CVFL)\nto fully utilize all horizontally partitioned labels to train neural networks\nwith privacy-preservation. To mitigate the straggler problem, we design a novel\noptimization objective which can increase straggler's contribution to the\ntrained models. We conduct a series of qualitative experiments to rigorously\nverify the effectiveness of CVFL. It is demonstrated that CVFL can achieve\ncomparable performance (e.g., accuracy for classification tasks) with\ncentralized training. The new optimization objective can further mitigate the\nstraggler problem comparing with only using the asynchronous aggregation\nmechanism during training.",

          "description": "Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm in which many\nclients with heterogeneous, unbalanced, and often sensitive local data,\ncollaborate to learn a model. Local Differential Privacy (LDP) provides a\nstrong guarantee that each client's data cannot be leaked during and after\ntraining, without relying on a trusted third party. While LDP is often believed\nto be too stringent to allow for satisfactory utility, our paper challenges\nthis belief. We consider a general setup with unbalanced, heterogeneous data,\ndisparate privacy needs across clients, and unreliable communication, where a\nrandom number/subset of clients is available each round. We propose three LDP\nalgorithms for smooth (strongly) convex FL; each are noisy variations of\ndistributed minibatch SGD. One is accelerated and one involves novel\ntime-varying noise, which we use to obtain the first non-trivial LDP excess\nrisk bound for the fully general non-i.i.d. FL problem. Specializing to i.i.d.\nclients, our risk bounds interpolate between the best known and/or optimal\nbounds in the centralized setting and the cross-device setting, where each\nclient represents just one person's data. Furthermore, we show that in certain\nregimes, our convergence rate (nearly) matches the corresponding non-private\nlower bound or outperforms state of the art non-private algorithms (``privacy\nfor free''). Finally, we validate our theoretical results and illustrate the\npractical utility of our algorithm with numerical experiments.",

          "description": "Recent work in equivariant deep learning bears strong similarities to\nphysics. Fields over a base space are fundamental entities in both subjects, as\nare equivariant maps between these fields. In deep learning, however, these\nmaps are usually defined by convolutions with a kernel, whereas they are\npartial differential operators (PDOs) in physics. Developing the theory of\nequivariant PDOs in the context of deep learning could bring these subjects\neven closer together and lead to a stronger flow of ideas. In this work, we\nderive a $G$-steerability constraint that completely characterizes when a PDO\nbetween feature vector fields is equivariant, for arbitrary symmetry groups\n$G$. We then fully solve this constraint for several important groups. We use\nour solutions as equivariant drop-in replacements for convolutional layers and\nbenchmark them in that role. Finally, we develop a framework for equivariant\nmaps based on Schwartz distributions that unifies classical convolutions and\ndifferential operators and gives insight about the relation between the two.",

          "description": "Many statistical models are given in the form of non-normalized densities\nwith an intractable normalization constant. Since maximum likelihood estimation\nis computationally intensive for these models, several estimation methods have\nbeen developed which do not require explicit computation of the normalization\nconstant, such as noise contrastive estimation (NCE) and score matching.\nHowever, model selection methods for general non-normalized models have not\nbeen proposed so far. In this study, we develop information criteria for\nnon-normalized models estimated by NCE or score matching. They are\napproximately unbiased estimators of discrepancy measures for non-normalized\nmodels. Simulation results and applications to real data demonstrate that the\nproposed criteria enable selection of the appropriate non-normalized model in a\ndata-driven manner.",

          "description": "The breakthrough of contrastive learning (CL) has fueled the recent success\nof self-supervised learning (SSL) in high-level vision tasks on RGB images.\nHowever, CL is still ill-defined for low-level vision tasks, such as joint\ndemosaicking and denoising (JDD), in the RAW domain. To bridge this\nmethodological gap, we present a novel CL approach on RAW images, residual\ncontrastive learning (RCL), which aims to learn meaningful representations for\nJDD. Our work is built on the assumption that noise contained in each RAW image\nis signal-dependent, thus two crops from the same RAW image should have more\nsimilar noise distribution than two crops from different RAW images. We use\nresiduals as a discriminative feature and the earth mover's distance to measure\nthe distribution divergence for the contrastive loss. To evaluate the proposed\nCL strategy, we simulate a series of unsupervised JDD experiments with\nlarge-scale data corrupted by synthetic signal-dependent noise, where we set a\nnew benchmark for unsupervised JDD tasks with unknown (random) noise variance.\nOur empirical study not only validates that CL can be applied on distributions\n(c.f. features), but also exposes the lack of robustness of previous non-ML and\nSSL JDD methods when the statistics of the noise are unknown, thus providing\nsome further insight into signal-dependent noise problems.",

          "description": "Decentralized training of deep learning models enables on-device learning\nover networks, as well as efficient scaling to large compute clusters.\nExperiments in earlier works reveal that, even in a data-center setup,\ndecentralized training often suffers from the degradation in the quality of the\nmodel: the training and test performance of models trained in a decentralized\nfashion is in general worse than that of models trained in a centralized\nfashion, and this performance drop is impacted by parameters such as network\nsize, communication topology and data partitioning. We identify the changing\nconsensus distance between devices as a key parameter to explain the gap\nbetween centralized and decentralized training.\n\nWe show in theory that when the training consensus distance is lower than a\ncritical quantity, decentralized training converges as fast as the centralized\ncounterpart. We empirically validate that the relation between generalization\nperformance and consensus distance is consistent with this theoretical\nobservation. Our empirical insights allow the principled design of better\ndecentralized training schemes that mitigate the performance drop. To this end,\nwe provide practical training guidelines and exemplify its effectiveness on the\ndata-center setup as the important first step.",

Deep learning\nmethods provide both optimization techniques and architectures for\napproximating nonlinear functions from noisy, high-dimensional observations.\nHowever, prevailing optimization techniques are not designed for\nstrictly-incremental online updates. Nor are standard architectures designed\nfor observations with an a priori unknown structure: for example, light sensors\nrandomly dispersed in space. This paper proposes an online RL prediction\nalgorithm with an adaptive architecture that efficiently finds useful nonlinear\nfeatures. The algorithm is evaluated in a spatial domain with high-dimensional,\nstochastic observations. The algorithm outperforms non-adaptive baseline\narchitectures and approaches the performance of an architecture given\nside-channel information.

It\ndecomposes multi-channel signals on graphs into subspaces and handles\nparticular information in each subspace with an adapted filter. The filters of\nall subspaces have different frequency responses and together form a filter\nbank. Furthermore, each filter in the spectral domain corresponds to a message\npassing scheme, and diverse schemes are implemented via the filter bank.\nImportantly, the filter bank and the signal decomposition are jointly learned\nto adapt to the spectral characteristics of data and to target applications.\nFurthermore, this is implemented almost without extra parameters in comparison\nwith most existing MPGCNs.

          "description": "Interpretability has become a necessary feature for machine learning models\ndeployed in critical scenarios, e.g. legal systems, healthcare. In these\nsituations, algorithmic decisions may have (potentially negative) long-lasting\neffects on the end-user affected by the decision. In many cases, the\nrepresentational power of deep learning models is not needed, therefore simple\nand interpretable models (e.g. linear models) should be preferred. However, in\nhigh-dimensional and/or complex domains (e.g. computer vision), the universal\napproximation capabilities of neural networks is required. Inspired by linear\nmodels and the Kolmogorov-Arnol representation theorem, we propose a novel\nclass of structurally-constrained neural networks, which we call FLANs\n(Feature-wise Latent Additive Networks). Crucially, FLANs process each input\nfeature separately, computing for each of them a representation in a common\nlatent space. These feature-wise latent representations are then simply summed,\nand the aggregated representation is used for prediction. These constraints\n(which are at the core of the interpretability of linear models) allow an user\nto estimate the effect of each individual feature independently from the\nothers, enhancing interpretability.

          "description": "Vision Transformers (ViT) have been shown to attain highly competitive\nperformance for a wide range of vision applications, such as image\nclassification, object detection and semantic image segmentation. In comparison\nto convolutional neural networks, the Vision Transformer's weaker inductive\nbias is generally found to cause an increased reliance on model regularization\nor data augmentation (``AugReg'' for short) when training on smaller training\ndatasets. We conduct a systematic empirical study in order to better understand\nthe interplay between the amount of training data, AugReg, model size and\ncompute budget. As one result of this study we find that the combination of\nincreased compute and AugReg can yield models with the same performance as\nmodels trained on an order of magnitude more training data: we train ViT models\nof various sizes on the public ImageNet-21k dataset which either match or\noutperform their counterparts trained on the larger, but not publicly available\nJFT-300M dataset.",

          "description": "Several years of research have shown that machine-learning systems are\nvulnerable to adversarial examples, both in theory and in practice. Until now,\nsuch attacks have primarily targeted visual models, exploiting the gap between\nhuman and machine perception. Although text-based models have also been\nattacked with adversarial examples, such attacks struggled to preserve semantic\nmeaning and indistinguishability. In this paper, we explore a large class of\nadversarial examples that can be used to attack text-based models in a\nblack-box setting without making any human-perceptible visual modification to\ninputs. We use encoding-specific perturbations that are imperceptible to the\nhuman eye to manipulate the outputs of a wide range of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) systems from neural machine-translation pipelines to web\nsearch engines. We find that with a single imperceptible encoding injection --\nrepresenting one invisible character, homoglyph, reordering, or deletion -- an\nattacker can significantly reduce the performance of vulnerable models, and\nwith three injections most models can be functionally broken. Our attacks work\nagainst currently-deployed commercial systems, including those produced by\nMicrosoft and Google, in addition to open source models published by Facebook\nand IBM. This novel series of attacks presents a significant threat to many\nlanguage processing systems: an attacker can affect systems in a targeted\nmanner without any assumptions about the underlying model. We conclude that\ntext-based NLP systems require careful input sanitization, just like\nconventional applications, and that given such systems are now being deployed\nrapidly at scale, the urgent attention of architects and operators is required.",

To this end, we propose a unified zero-shot framework to handle\nthese aforementioned challenges during federated learning.

In\ncontrast, practical systems are more usually trained/fine-tuned on sequentially\ncaptured real-time data, in which case poisoning adversaries could dynamically\npoison each data batch according to the current model state. In this paper, we\nfocus on the real-time settings and propose a new attacking strategy, which\naffiliates an accumulative phase with poisoning attacks to secretly (i.e.,\nwithout affecting accuracy) magnify the destructive effect of a (poisoned)\ntrigger batch. By mimicking online learning and federated learning on CIFAR-10,\nwe show that the model accuracy will significantly drop by a single update step\non the trigger batch after the accumulative phase.

          "description": "In today's ML, data can be twisted (changed) in various ways, either for bad\nor good intent. Such twisted data challenges the founding theory of properness\nfor supervised losses which form the basis for many popular losses for class\nprobability estimation. Unfortunately, at its core, properness ensures that the\noptimal models also learn the twist. In this paper, we analyse such class\nprobability-based losses when they are stripped off the mandatory properness;\nwe define twist-proper losses as losses formally able to retrieve the optimum\n(untwisted) estimate off the twists, and show that a natural extension of a\nhalf-century old loss introduced by S. Arimoto is twist proper. We then turn to\na theory that has provided some of the best off-the-shelf algorithms for proper\nlosses, boosting. Boosting can require access to the derivative of the convex\nconjugate of a loss to compute examples weights. Such a function can be hard to\nget, for computational or mathematical reasons; this turns out to be the case\nfor Arimoto's loss. We bypass this difficulty by inverting the problem as\nfollows: suppose a blueprint boosting algorithm is implemented with a general\nweight update function. What are the losses for which boosting-compliant\nminimisation happens? Our answer comes as a general boosting algorithm which\nmeets the optimal boosting dependence on the number of calls to the weak\nlearner; when applied to Arimoto's loss, it leads to a simple optimisation\nalgorithm whose performances are showcased on several domains and twists.",

          "description": "To evaluate clustering results is a significant part of cluster analysis.\nSince there are no true class labels for clustering in typical unsupervised\nlearning, many internal cluster validity indices (CVIs), which use predicted\nlabels and data, have been created. Without true labels, to design an effective\nCVI is as difficult as to create a clustering method. And it is crucial to have\nmore CVIs because there are no universal CVIs that can be used to measure all\ndatasets and no specific methods of selecting a proper CVI for clusters without\ntrue labels. Therefore, to apply a variety of CVIs to evaluate clustering\nresults is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel internal CVI -- the\nDistance-based Separability Index (DSI), based on a data separability measure.\nWe compared the DSI with eight internal CVIs including studies from early Dunn\n(1974) to most recent CVDD (2019) and an external CVI as ground truth, by using\nclustering results of five clustering algorithms on 12 real and 97 synthetic\ndatasets. Results show DSI is an effective, unique, and competitive CVI to\nother compared CVIs. We also summarized the general process to evaluate CVIs\nand created the rank-difference metric for comparison of CVIs' results.",

          "description": "This paper investigates two techniques for developing efficient\nself-supervised vision transformers (EsViT) for visual representation learning.\nFirst, we show through a comprehensive empirical study that multi-stage\narchitectures with sparse self-attentions can significantly reduce modeling\ncomplexity but with a cost of losing the ability to capture fine-grained\ncorrespondences between image regions. Second, we propose a new pre-training\ntask of region matching which allows the model to capture fine-grained region\ndependencies and as a result significantly improves the quality of the learned\nvision representations. Our results show that combining the two techniques,\nEsViT achieves 81.3% top-1 on the ImageNet linear probe evaluation,\noutperforming prior arts with around an order magnitude of higher throughput.\nWhen transferring to downstream linear classification tasks, EsViT outperforms\nits supervised counterpart on 17 out of 18 datasets.

Despite the conceptual appeal\nof IRM, the effectiveness of the originally proposed invariance penalty has\nrecently been brought into question. In particular, there exists\ncounterexamples for which that invariance penalty can be arbitrarily small for\nnon-invariant data representations.

To define the artificial labels, we exploit the\nassumption that neural network generators can be trained more easily to map\nnearby latent vectors to data with semantic similarities, than across separate\ncategories. We use generated data samples and their corresponding artificial\nconditioning labels to train a classifier. The classifier is then used to\nself-label real data. To boost the accuracy of the self-labeling, we also use\nthe exponential moving average of the classifier.

          "description": "Accurate prediction of machining cycle times is important in the\nmanufacturing industry. Usually, Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software\nestimates the machining times using the commanded feedrate from the toolpath\nfile using basic kinematic settings. Typically, the methods do not account for\ntoolpath geometry or toolpath tolerance and therefore under estimate the\nmachining cycle times considerably. Removing the need for machine specific\nknowledge, this paper presents a data-driven feedrate and machining cycle time\nprediction method by building a neural network model for each machine tool\naxis. In this study, datasets composed of the commanded feedrate, nominal\nacceleration, toolpath geometry and the measured feedrate were used to train a\nneural network model. Validation trials using a representative industrial thin\nwall structure component on a commercial machining centre showed that this\nmethod estimated the machining time with more than 90% accuracy. This method\nshowed that neural network models have the capability to learn the behavior of\na complex machine tool system and predict cycle times. Further integration of\nthe methods will be critical in the implantation of digital twins in Industry\n4.0.",

          "description": "An important challenge facing modern machine learning is how to rigorously\nquantify the uncertainty of model predictions. Conveying uncertainty is\nespecially important when there are changes to the underlying data distribution\nthat might invalidate the predictive model. Yet, most existing uncertainty\nquantification algorithms break down in the presence of such shifts. We propose\na novel approach that addresses this challenge by constructing \\emph{probably\napproximately correct (PAC)} prediction sets in the presence of covariate\nshift. Our approach focuses on the setting where there is a covariate shift\nfrom the source distribution (where we have labeled training examples) to the\ntarget distribution (for which we want to quantify uncertainty). Our algorithm\nassumes given importance weights that encode how the probabilities of the\ntraining examples change under the covariate shift. In practice, importance\nweights typically need to be estimated; thus, we extend our algorithm to the\nsetting where we are given confidence intervals for the importance weights\nrather than their true value. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach\non various covariate shifts designed based on the DomainNet and ImageNet\ndatasets.",

The method is\ngradient-free, model-informed, and data-driven with reservoir computing based\non echo state networks. First, we analyse the predictive capabilities of echo\nstate networks both in the short- and long-time prediction of the dynamics. We\nfind that both fully data-driven and model-informed architectures learn the\nchaotic acoustic dynamics, both time-accurately and statistically. Informing\nthe training with a physical reduced-order model with one acoustic mode\nmarkedly improves the accuracy and robustness of the echo state networks,\nwhilst keeping the computational cost low. Echo state networks offer accurate\npredictions of the long-time dynamics, which would be otherwise expensive by\nintegrating the governing equations to evaluate the time-averaged quantity to\noptimize. Second, we couple echo state networks with a Bayesian technique to\nexplore the design thermoacoustic parameter space. The computational method is\nminimally intrusive. Third, we find the set of flame parameters that minimize\nthe time-averaged acoustic energy of chaotic oscillations, which are caused by\nthe positive feedback with a heat source, such as a flame in gas turbines or\nrocket motors. These oscillations are known as thermoacoustic oscillations. The\noptimal set of flame parameters is found with the same accuracy as brute-force\ngrid search, but with a convergence rate that is more than one order of\nmagnitude faster. This work opens up new possibilities for non-intrusive\n(``hands-off'') optimization of chaotic systems, in which the cost of\ngenerating data, for example from high-fidelity simulations and experiments, is\nhigh.",

Recently, NOTEARS [Zheng et al., 2018] formulates\nthe causal structure learning problem as a continuous optimization problem\nusing least-square loss with an acyclicity constraint. Though the least-square\nloss function is well justified under the standard Gaussian noise assumption,\nit is limited if the assumption does not hold. In this work, we theoretically\nshow that the violation of the Gaussian noise assumption will hinder the causal\ndirection identification, making the causal orientation fully determined by the\ncausal strength as well as the variances of noises in the linear case and the\nnoises of strong non-Gaussianity in the nonlinear case. Consequently, we\npropose a more general entropy-based loss that is theoretically consistent with\nthe likelihood score under any noise distribution. We run extensive empirical\nevaluations on both synthetic data and real-world data to validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method and show that our method achieves the best\nin Structure Hamming Distance, False Discovery Rate, and True Positive Rate\nmatrices.",

MLRATE is robust to poor\npredictions from the machine learning step: if the predictions are uncorrelated\nwith the outcomes, the estimator performs asymptotically no worse than the\nstandard difference-in-means estimator, while if predictions are highly\ncorrelated with outcomes, the efficiency gains are large. In A/A tests, for a\nset of 48 outcome metrics commonly monitored in Facebook experiments the\nestimator has over 70% lower variance than the simple difference-in-means\nestimator, and about 19% lower variance than the common univariate procedure\nwhich adjusts only for pre-experiment values of the outcome.",

          "description": "Multiple views of data, both naturally acquired (e.g., image and audio) and\nartificially produced (e.g., via adding different noise to data samples), have\nproven useful in enhancing representation learning. Natural views are often\nhandled by multiview analysis tools, e.g., (deep) canonical correlation\nanalysis [(D)CCA], while the artificial ones are frequently used in\nself-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms, e.g., SimCLR and Barlow Twins. Both\ntypes of approaches often involve learning neural feature extractors such that\nthe embeddings of data exhibit high cross-view correlations. Although\nintuitive, the effectiveness of correlation-based neural embedding is only\nempirically validated. This work puts forth a theory-backed framework for\nunsupervised multiview learning. Our development starts with proposing a\nmultiview model, where each view is a nonlinear mixture of shared and private\ncomponents. Consequently, the learning problem boils down to shared/private\ncomponent identification and disentanglement. Under this model, latent\ncorrelation maximization is shown to guarantee the extraction of the shared\ncomponents across views (up to certain ambiguities). In addition, the private\ninformation in each view can be provably disentangled from the shared using\nproper regularization design. The method is tested on a series of tasks, e.g.,\ndownstream clustering, which all show promising performance.

Pure Machine Learning (ML) approaches often\nfail in the small sample regime and cannot provide actionable insights beyond\npredictions. A promising modification has been to incorporate expert domain\nknowledge into ML models. The application we consider is predicting the\nprogression of disease under medications, where a plethora of domain knowledge\nis available from pharmacology. Pharmacological models describe the dynamics of\ncarefully-chosen medically meaningful variables in terms of systems of Ordinary\nDifferential Equations (ODEs). However, these models only describe a limited\ncollection of variables, and these variables are often not observable in\nclinical environments. To close this gap, we propose the latent hybridisation\nmodel (LHM) that integrates a system of expert-designed ODEs with\nmachine-learned Neural ODEs to fully describe the dynamics of the system and to\nlink the expert and latent variables to observable quantities. We evaluated LHM\non synthetic data as well as real-world intensive care data of COVID-19\npatients.

          "description": "Despite the popularisation of machine learning models, more often than not,\nthey still operate as black boxes with no insight into what is happening inside\nthe model. There exist a few methods that allow to visualise and explain why a\nmodel has made a certain prediction. Those methods, however, allow\nvisualisation of the link between the input and output of the model without\npresenting how the model learns to represent the data used to train the model\nas whole. In this paper, a method that addresses that issue is proposed, with a\nfocus on visualising multi-dimensional time-series data. Experiments on a\nhigh-frequency stock market dataset show that the method provides fast and\ndiscernible visualisations. Large datasets can be visualised quickly and on one\nplot, which makes it easy for a user to compare the learned representations of\nthe data. The developed method successfully combines known techniques to\nprovide an insight into the inner workings of time-series classification\nmodels.",

          "description": "State abstraction has been an essential tool for dramatically improving the\nsample efficiency of reinforcement-learning algorithms. Indeed, by exposing and\naccentuating various types of latent structure within the environment,\ndifferent classes of state abstraction have enabled improved theoretical\nguarantees and empirical performance. When dealing with state abstractions that\ncapture structure in the value function, however, a standard assumption is that\nthe true abstraction has been supplied or unrealistically computed a priori,\nleaving open the question of how to efficiently uncover such latent structure\nwhile jointly seeking out optimal behavior. Taking inspiration from the bandit\nliterature, we propose that an agent seeking out latent task structure must\nexplicitly represent and maintain its uncertainty over that structure as part\nof its overall uncertainty about the environment. We introduce a practical\nalgorithm for doing this using two posterior distributions over state\nabstractions and abstract-state values. In empirically validating our approach,\nwe find that substantial performance gains lie in the multi-task setting where\ntasks share a common, low-dimensional representation.",

In the successful network\narchitectures, shortcut connections are well established to take the outputs of\nearlier layers as additional inputs to later layers, which have produced\nexcellent results. Despite the extraordinary effectiveness of shortcuts, there\nremain important questions on the underlying mechanism and associated\nfunctionalities. For example, why are shortcuts powerful? Why shortcuts\ngeneralize well? To address these questions, we investigate the representation\nand generalization ability of a sparse shortcut topology. Specifically, we\nfirst demonstrate that this topology can empower a one-neuron-wide deep network\nto approximate any univariate continuous function. Then, we present a novel\nwidth-bounded universal approximator in contrast to depth-bounded universal\napproximators, and also extend the approximation result to a family of networks\nsuch that in the view of approximation ability, these networks are equally\ncompetent. Furthermore, we use the generalization bound theory to show that the\ninvestigated shortcut topology enjoys an excellent generalizability. Finally,\nwe corroborate our theoretical analyses with experiments on some well-known\nbenchmarks.",

          "description": "Federated learning (FL) has been proposed to allow collaborative training of\nmachine learning (ML) models among multiple parties where each party can keep\nits data private. In this paradigm, only model updates, such as model weights\nor gradients, are shared. Many existing approaches have focused on horizontal\nFL, where each party has the entire feature set and labels in the training data\nset. However, many real scenarios follow a vertically-partitioned FL setup,\nwhere a complete feature set is formed only when all the datasets from the\nparties are combined, and the labels are only available to a single party.\nPrivacy-preserving vertical FL is challenging because complete sets of labels\nand features are not owned by one entity. Existing approaches for vertical FL\nrequire multiple peer-to-peer communications among parties, leading to lengthy\ntraining times, and are restricted to (approximated) linear models and just two\nparties. To close this gap, we propose FedV, a framework for secure gradient\ncomputation in vertical settings for several widely used ML models such as\nlinear models, logistic regression, and support vector machines. FedV removes\nthe need for peer-to-peer communication among parties by using functional\nencryption schemes; this allows FedV to achieve faster training times. It also\nworks for larger and changing sets of parties. We empirically demonstrate the\napplicability for multiple types of ML models and show a reduction of 10%-70%\nof training time and 80% to 90% in data transfer with respect to the\nstate-of-the-art approaches.",

          "description": "ResNets constrained to be bi-Lipschitz, that is, approximately distance\npreserving, have been a crucial component of recently proposed techniques for\ndeterministic uncertainty quantification in neural models. We show that\ntheoretical justifications for recent regularisation schemes trying to enforce\nsuch a constraint suffer from a crucial flaw -- the theoretical link between\nthe regularisation scheme used and bi-Lipschitzness is only valid under\nconditions which do not hold in practice, rendering existing theory of limited\nuse, despite the strong empirical performance of these models. We provide a\ntheoretical explanation for the effectiveness of these regularisation schemes\nusing a frequency analysis perspective, showing that under mild conditions\nthese schemes will enforce a lower Lipschitz bound on the low-frequency\nprojection of images. We then provide empirical evidence supporting our\ntheoretical claims, and perform further experiments which demonstrate that our\nbroader conclusions appear to hold when some of the mathematical assumptions of\nour proof are relaxed, corresponding to the setup used in prior work. In\naddition, we present a simple constructive algorithm to search for counter\nexamples to the distance preservation condition, and discuss possible\nimplications of our theory for future model design.",

Yet, it has not\nachieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level\nprediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery\nhow Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this\npaper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the\nstandard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a\nbroad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent\nOGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the\ngraph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a\ngraph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective\nstructural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured\ndata. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of\nGraphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural\ninformation of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the\nspecial cases of Graphormer.",

          "description": "Robust multi-agent trajectory prediction is essential for the safe control of\nrobots and vehicles that interact with humans. Many existing methods treat\nsocial and temporal information separately and therefore fall short of\nmodelling the joint future trajectories of all agents in a socially consistent\nway. To address this, we propose a new class of Latent Variable Sequential Set\nTransformers which autoregressively model multi-agent trajectories. We refer to\nthese architectures as \"AutoBots\". AutoBots model the contents of sets (e.g.\nrepresenting the properties of agents in a scene) over time and employ\nmulti-head self-attention blocks over these sequences of sets to encode the\nsociotemporal relationships between the different actors of a scene. This\nproduces either the trajectory of one ego-agent or a distribution over the\nfuture trajectories for all agents under consideration. Our approach works for\ngeneral sequences of sets and we provide illustrative experiments modelling the\nsequential structure of the multiple strokes that make up symbols in the\nOmniglot data. For the single-agent prediction case, we validate our model on\nthe NuScenes motion prediction task and achieve competitive results on the\nglobal leaderboard. In the multi-agent forecasting setting, we validate our\nmodel on TrajNet. We find that our method outperforms physical extrapolation\nand recurrent network baselines and generates scene-consistent trajectories.",

Besides, we prove the\nstatistical rate for the eigenspace of the underlying matrix, which is\ncomparable to the rate under the independently missing assumption.

          "description": "Domain adaptation on time series data is an important but challenging task.\nMost of the existing works in this area are based on the learning of the\ndomain-invariant representation of the data with the help of restrictions like\nMMD. However, such extraction of the domain-invariant representation is a\nnon-trivial task for time series data, due to the complex dependence among the\ntimestamps. In detail, in the fully dependent time series, a small change of\nthe time lags or the offsets may lead to difficulty in the domain invariant\nextraction. Fortunately, the stability of the causality inspired us to explore\nthe domain invariant structure of the data. To reduce the difficulty in the\ndiscovery of causal structure, we relax it to the sparse associative structure\nand propose a novel sparse associative structure alignment model for domain\nadaptation. First, we generate the segment set to exclude the obstacle of\noffsets. Second, the intra-variables and inter-variables sparse attention\nmechanisms are devised to extract associative structure time-series data with\nconsidering time lags. Finally, the associative structure alignment is used to\nguide the transfer of knowledge from the source domain to the target one.\nExperimental studies not only verify the good performance of our methods on\nthree real-world datasets but also provide some insightful discoveries on the\ntransferred knowledge.",

Finally,\nas an example of our framework's flexibility, we introduce the first nonlinear\nICA model for time-series that combines the following very useful properties:\nit accounts for both nonstationarity and autocorrelation in a fully\nunsupervised setting; performs dimensionality reduction; models hidden states;\nand enables principled estimation and inference by variational\nmaximum-likelihood.",

In fact, all\nexisting algorithms demand function-approximation assumptions stronger than\nrealizability, and the mounting negative evidence has led to a conjecture that\nsample-efficient learning is impossible in this setting (Chen and Jiang, 2019).\nOur algorithm, BVFT, breaks the hardness conjecture (albeit under a stronger\nnotion of exploratory data) via a tournament procedure that reduces the\nlearning problem to pairwise comparison, and solves the latter with the help of\na state-action partition constructed from the compared functions. We also\ndiscuss how BVFT can be applied to model selection among other extensions and\nopen problems.",

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer an excellent solution\nfor face recognition and classification of correct mask wearing and\npositioning. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, such algorithms\ncan be used at entrances to corporate buildings, airports, shopping areas, and\nother indoor locations, to mitigate the spread of the virus. These application\nscenarios impose major challenges to the underlying compute platform. The\ninference hardware must be cheap, small and energy efficient, while providing\nsufficient memory and compute power to execute accurate CNNs at a reasonably\nlow latency. To maintain data privacy of the public, all processing must remain\non the edge-device, without any communication with cloud servers. To address\nthese challenges, we present a low-power binary neural network classifier for\ncorrect facial-mask wear and positioning. The classification task is\nimplemented on an embedded FPGA, performing high-throughput binary operations.\nClassification can take place at up to ~6400 frames-per-second, easily enabling\nmulti-camera, speed-gate settings or statistics collection in crowd settings.\nWhen deployed on a single entrance or gate, the idle power consumption is\nreduced to 1.6W, improving the battery-life of the device. We achieve an\naccuracy of up to 98% for four wearing positions of the MaskedFace-Net dataset.\nTo maintain equivalent classification accuracy for all face structures,\nskin-tones, hair types, and mask types, the algorithms are tested for their\nability to generalize the relevant features over all subjects using the\nGrad-CAM approach.",

          "description": "Predicting all applicable labels for a given image is known as multi-label\nclassification. Compared to the standard multi-class case (where each image has\nonly one label), it is considerably more challenging to annotate training data\nfor multi-label classification. When the number of potential labels is large,\nhuman annotators find it difficult to mention all applicable labels for each\ntraining image. Furthermore, in some settings detection is intrinsically\ndifficult e.g. finding small object instances in high resolution images. As a\nresult, multi-label training data is often plagued by false negatives. We\nconsider the hardest version of this problem, where annotators provide only one\nrelevant label for each image. As a result, training sets will have only one\npositive label per image and no confirmed negatives. We explore this special\ncase of learning from missing labels across four different multi-label image\nclassification datasets for both linear classifiers and end-to-end fine-tuned\ndeep networks. We extend existing multi-label losses to this setting and\npropose novel variants that constrain the number of expected positive labels\nduring training.

          "description": "Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of graph convolutional\nnetworks (GCNs) to edge-perturbing attacks, such as maliciously inserting or\ndeleting graph edges. However, a theoretical proof of such vulnerability\nremains a big challenge, and effective defense schemes are still open issues.\nIn this paper, we first generalize the formulation of edge-perturbing attacks\nand strictly prove the vulnerability of GCNs to such attacks in node\nclassification tasks. Following this, an anonymous graph convolutional network,\nnamed AN-GCN, is proposed to counter against edge-perturbing attacks.\nSpecifically, we present a node localization theorem to demonstrate how the GCN\nlocates nodes during its training phase. In addition, we design a staggered\nGaussian noise based node position generator, and devise a spectral graph\nconvolution based discriminator in detecting the generated node positions.\nFurther, we give the optimization of the above generator and discriminator.\nAN-GCN can classify nodes without taking their position as input. It is\ndemonstrated that the AN-GCN is secure against edge-perturbing attacks in node\nclassification tasks, as AN-GCN classifies nodes without the edge information\nand thus makes it impossible for attackers to perturb edges anymore. Extensive\nevaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of the general edge-perturbing\nattack model in manipulating the classification results of the target nodes.\nMore importantly, the proposed AN-GCN can achieve 82.7% in node classification\naccuracy without the edge-reading permission, which outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art GCN.",

This paper is about KD and\nS-T learning, which are being actively studied in recent years. First, we aim\nto provide explanations of what KD is and how/why it works.

          "description": "The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial attack, which\nis an attack that can mislead state-of-the-art classifiers into making an\nincorrect classification with high confidence by deliberately perturbing the\noriginal inputs, raises concerns about the robustness of DNNs to such attacks.\nAdversarial training, which is the main heuristic method for improving\nadversarial robustness and the first line of defense against adversarial\nattacks, requires many sample-by-sample calculations to increase training size\nand is usually insufficiently strong for an entire network. This paper provides\na new perspective on the issue of adversarial robustness, one that shifts the\nfocus from the network as a whole to the critical part of the region close to\nthe decision boundary corresponding to a given class. From this perspective, we\npropose a method to generate a single but image-agnostic adversarial\nperturbation that carries the semantic information implying the directions to\nthe fragile parts on the decision boundary and causes inputs to be\nmisclassified as a specified target. We call the adversarial training based on\nsuch perturbations \"region adversarial training\" (RAT), which resembles\nclassical adversarial training but is distinguished in that it reinforces the\nsemantic information missing in the relevant regions. Experimental results on\nthe MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that this approach greatly improves\nadversarial robustness even using a very small dataset from the training data;\nmoreover, it can defend against FGSM adversarial attacks that have a completely\ndifferent pattern from the model seen during retraining.",

          "description": "Recent works in self-supervised learning have advanced the state-of-the-art\nby relying on the contrastive learning paradigm, which learns representations\nby pushing positive pairs, or similar examples from the same class, closer\ntogether while keeping negative pairs far apart. Despite the empirical\nsuccesses, theoretical foundations are limited -- prior analyses assume\nconditional independence of the positive pairs given the same class label, but\nrecent empirical applications use heavily correlated positive pairs (i.e., data\naugmentations of the same image). Our work analyzes contrastive learning\nwithout assuming conditional independence of positive pairs using a novel\nconcept of the augmentation graph on data. Edges in this graph connect\naugmentations of the same data, and ground-truth classes naturally form\nconnected sub-graphs. We propose a loss that performs spectral decomposition on\nthe population augmentation graph and can be succinctly written as a\ncontrastive learning objective on neural net representations. Minimizing this\nobjective leads to features with provable accuracy guarantees under linear\nprobe evaluation. By standard generalization bounds, these accuracy guarantees\nalso hold when minimizing the training contrastive loss. Empirically, the\nfeatures learned by our objective can match or outperform several strong\nbaselines on benchmark vision datasets.

Training such an adaptive scorer efficiently is a challenging\nproblem; in order to precisely quantify the effect of a data instance at a\ngiven time during the training, it is typically necessary to first complete the\nentire training process. To efficiently optimize data usage, we propose a\nreinforcement learning approach called Differentiable Data Selection (DDS). In\nDDS, we formulate a scorer network as a learnable function of the training\ndata, which can be efficiently updated along with the main model being trained.\nSpecifically, DDS updates the scorer with an intuitive reward signal: it should\nup-weigh the data that has a similar gradient with a dev set upon which we\nwould finally like to perform well.

However, they\ndecrease the convergence speed of training algorithms. Adaptive regularization\nschemes can solve overfitting more intelligently. They usually do not affect\nthe entire network weights. This paper detects a subset of the weighting layers\nthat cause overfitting. The overfitting recognizes by matrix and tensor\ncondition numbers. An adaptive regularization scheme entitled Adaptive Low-Rank\n(ALR) is proposed that converges a subset of the weighting layers to their\nLow-Rank Factorization (LRF). It happens by minimizing a new Tikhonov-based\nloss function. ALR also encourages lazy weights to contribute to the\nregularization when epochs grow up. It uses a damping sequence to increment\nlayer selection likelihood in the last generations. Thus before falling the\ntraining accuracy, ALR reduces the lazy weights and regularizes the network\nsubstantially. The experimental results show that ALR regularizes the deep\nnetworks well with high training speed and low resource usage.",

          "description": "Understanding the semantics of human movement -- the what, how and why of the\nmovement -- is an important problem that requires datasets of human actions\nwith semantic labels. Existing datasets take one of two approaches. Large-scale\nvideo datasets contain many action labels but do not contain ground-truth 3D\nhuman motion. Alternatively, motion-capture (mocap) datasets have precise body\nmotions but are limited to a small number of actions. To address this, we\npresent BABEL, a large dataset with language labels describing the actions\nbeing performed in mocap sequences. BABEL consists of action labels for about\n43 hours of mocap sequences from AMASS. Action labels are at two levels of\nabstraction -- sequence labels describe the overall action in the sequence, and\nframe labels describe all actions in every frame of the sequence. Each frame\nlabel is precisely aligned with the duration of the corresponding action in the\nmocap sequence, and multiple actions can overlap. There are over 28k sequence\nlabels, and 63k frame labels in BABEL, which belong to over 250 unique action\ncategories. Labels from BABEL can be leveraged for tasks like action\nrecognition, temporal action localization, motion synthesis, etc. To\ndemonstrate the value of BABEL as a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of\nmodels on 3D action recognition. We demonstrate that BABEL poses interesting\nlearning challenges that are applicable to real-world scenarios, and can serve\nas a useful benchmark of progress in 3D action recognition. The dataset,\nbaseline method, and evaluation code is made available, and supported for\nacademic research purposes at https://babel.is.tue.mpg.de/.",

In this work, we address the question of how to determine whether a\nparametric model, such as a stochastic block model or latent space model, fits\na dataset well and will extrapolate to similar data. We use recent results in\nrandom matrix theory to derive a general goodness-of-fit test for dyadic data.\nWe show that our method, when applied to a specific model of interest, provides\nan straightforward, computationally fast way of selecting parameters in a\nnumber of commonly used network models. For example, we show how to select the\ndimension of the latent space in latent space models. Unlike other network\ngoodness-of-fit methods, our general approach does not require simulating from\na candidate parametric model, which can be cumbersome with large graphs, and\neliminates the need to choose a particular set of statistics on the graph for\ncomparison. It also allows us to perform goodness-of-fit tests on partial\nnetwork data, such as Aggregated Relational Data. We show with simulations that\nour method performs well in many situations of interest.

          "description": "Sensory input from multiple sources is crucial for robust and coherent human\nperception. Different sources contribute complementary explanatory factors.\nSimilarly, research studies often collect multimodal imaging data, each of\nwhich can provide shared and unique information. This observation motivated the\ndesign of powerful multimodal self-supervised representation-learning\nalgorithms. In this paper, we unify recent work on multimodal self-supervised\nlearning under a single framework. Observing that most self-supervised methods\noptimize similarity metrics between a set of model components, we propose a\ntaxonomy of all reasonable ways to organize this process. We first evaluate\nmodels on toy multimodal MNIST datasets and then apply them to a multimodal\nneuroimaging dataset with Alzheimer's disease patients. We find that (1)\nmultimodal contrastive learning has significant benefits over its unimodal\ncounterpart, (2) the specific composition of multiple contrastive objectives is\ncritical to performance on a downstream task, (3) maximization of the\nsimilarity between representations has a regularizing effect on a neural\nnetwork, which can sometimes lead to reduced downstream performance but still\nreveal multimodal relations. Results show that the proposed approach\noutperforms previous self-supervised encoder-decoder methods based on canonical\ncorrelation analysis (CCA) or the mixture-of-experts multimodal variational\nautoEncoder (MMVAE) on various datasets with a linear evaluation protocol.\nImportantly, we find a promising solution to uncover connections between\nmodalities through a jointly shared subspace that can help advance work in our\nsearch for neuroimaging biomarkers.",

          "description": "Learning with noisy labels has attracted a lot of attention in recent years,\nwhere the mainstream approaches are in pointwise manners. Meanwhile, pairwise\nmanners have shown great potential in supervised metric learning and\nunsupervised contrastive learning. Thus, a natural question is raised: does\nlearning in a pairwise manner mitigate label noise? To give an affirmative\nanswer, in this paper, we propose a framework called Class2Simi: it transforms\ndata points with noisy class labels to data pairs with noisy similarity labels,\nwhere a similarity label denotes whether a pair shares the class label or not.\nThrough this transformation, the reduction of the noise rate is theoretically\nguaranteed, and hence it is in principle easier to handle noisy similarity\nlabels. Amazingly, DNNs that predict the clean class labels can be trained from\nnoisy data pairs if they are first pretrained from noisy data points.\nClass2Simi is computationally efficient because not only this transformation is\non-the-fly in mini-batches, but also it just changes loss computation on top of\nmodel prediction into a pairwise manner. Its effectiveness is verified by\nextensive experiments.",

          "description": "Dynamic Contrast Enhanced-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) is widely used\nto complement ultrasound examinations and x-ray mammography during the early\ndetection and diagnosis of breast cancer. However, images generated by various\nMRI scanners (e.g. GE Healthcare vs Siemens) differ both in intensity and noise\ndistribution, preventing algorithms trained on MRIs from one scanner to\ngeneralize to data from other scanners successfully. We propose a method for\nimage normalization to solve this problem. MRI normalization is challenging\nbecause it requires both normalizing intensity values and mapping between the\nnoise distributions of different scanners. We utilize a cycle-consistent\ngenerative adversarial network to learn a bidirectional mapping between MRIs\nproduced by GE Healthcare and Siemens scanners. This allows us learning the\nmapping between two different scanner types without matched data, which is not\ncommonly available. To ensure the preservation of breast shape and structures\nwithin the breast, we propose two technical innovations. First, we incorporate\na mutual information loss with the CycleGAN architecture to ensure that the\nstructure of the breast is maintained. Second, we propose a modified\ndiscriminator architecture which utilizes a smaller field-of-view to ensure the\npreservation of finer details in the breast tissue. Quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations show that the second proposed method was able to\nconsistently preserve a high level of detail in the breast structure while also\nperforming the proper intensity normalization and noise mapping. Our results\ndemonstrate that the proposed model can successfully learn a bidirectional\nmapping between MRIs produced by different vendors, potentially enabling\nimproved accuracy of downstream computational algorithms for diagnosis and\ndetection of breast cancer.

In this work, we\nstudy scientific LMs for KG completion, exploring whether we can tap into their\nlatent knowledge to enhance biomedical link prediction. We evaluate several\ndomain-specific LMs, fine-tuning them on datasets centered on drugs and\ndiseases that we represent as KGs and enrich with textual entity descriptions.\nWe integrate the LM-based models with KG embedding models, using a router\nmethod that learns to assign each input example to either type of model and\nprovides a substantial boost in performance. Finally, we demonstrate the\nadvantage of LM models in the inductive setting with novel scientific entities.\nOur datasets and code are made publicly available.",

          "description": "Following their success in natural language processing, transformers have\nrecently shown much promise for computer vision. The self-attention operation\nunderlying transformers yields global interactions between all tokens ,i.e.\nwords or image patches, and enables flexible modelling of image data beyond the\nlocal interactions of convolutions. This flexibility, however, comes with a\nquadratic complexity in time and memory, hindering application to long\nsequences and high-resolution images. We propose a \"transposed\" version of\nself-attention that operates across feature channels rather than tokens, where\nthe interactions are based on the cross-covariance matrix between keys and\nqueries. The resulting cross-covariance attention (XCA) has linear complexity\nin the number of tokens, and allows efficient processing of high-resolution\nimages. Our cross-covariance image transformer (XCiT) is built upon XCA. It\ncombines the accuracy of conventional transformers with the scalability of\nconvolutional architectures. We validate the effectiveness and generality of\nXCiT by reporting excellent results on multiple vision benchmarks, including\nimage classification and self-supervised feature learning on ImageNet-1k,\nobject detection and instance segmentation on COCO, and semantic segmentation\non ADE20k.",

In this work, we\nadopt a perspective based on the role of individual examples.

Our extensive investigation reveals\nsurprising yet simple relationships between the prediction depth of a given\ninput and the model's uncertainty, confidence, accuracy and speed of learning\nfor that data point. We further categorize difficult examples into three\ninterpretable groups, demonstrate how these groups are processed differently\ninside deep models and showcase how this understanding allows us to improve\nprediction accuracy. Insights from our study lead to a coherent view of a\nnumber of separately reported phenomena in the literature: early layers\ngeneralize while later layers memorize; early layers converge faster and\nnetworks learn easy data and simple functions first.",

However, we pay a price for the savings: lower precision\nmay yield larger round-off error and hence larger prediction error. As\napplications proliferate, users must choose which precision to use to train a\nnew model, and chip manufacturers must decide which precisions to manufacture.\nWe view these precision choices as a hyperparameter tuning problem, and borrow\nideas from meta-learning to learn the tradeoff between memory and error.

We use matrix factorization to find non-dominated configurations (the\nPareto frontier) with a limited number of network evaluations.

          "description": "The dominant paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale\npre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or\ndomains. As we pre-train larger models, conventional fine-tuning, which\nretrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an\nexample, deploying many independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with\n175B parameters, is extremely expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or\nLoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank\ndecomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly\nreducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. For GPT-3,\nLoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the\ncomputation hardware requirement by 3 times compared to full fine-tuning. LoRA\nperforms on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on both GPT-3 and\nGPT-2, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput,\nand no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation\ninto rank-deficiency in language model adaptations, which sheds light on the\nefficacy of LoRA.

Yet, its passive nature inevitably prevents it from being\nimmune to unknown attackers. To achieve a proactive defense, we need a more\nfundamental understanding of adversarial examples, beyond the popular bounded\nthreat model. In this paper, we provide a causal viewpoint of adversarial\nvulnerability: the cause is the confounder ubiquitously existing in learning,\nwhere attackers are precisely exploiting the confounding effect. Therefore, a\nfundamental solution for adversarial robustness is causal intervention. As the\nconfounder is unobserved in general, we propose to use the instrumental\nvariable that achieves intervention without the need for confounder\nobservation. We term our robust training method as Causal intervention by\ninstrumental Variable (CiiV). It has a differentiable retinotopic sampling\nlayer and a consistency loss, which is stable and guaranteed not to suffer from\ngradient obfuscation.

          "description": "Reasoning about the behaviour of physical objects is a key capability of\nagents operating in physical worlds. Humans are very experienced in physical\nreasoning while it remains a major challenge for AI. To facilitate research\naddressing this problem, several benchmarks have been proposed recently.\nHowever, these benchmarks do not enable us to measure an agent's granular\nphysical reasoning capabilities when solving a complex reasoning task. In this\npaper, we propose a new benchmark for physical reasoning that allows us to test\nindividual physical reasoning capabilities. Inspired by how humans acquire\nthese capabilities, we propose a general hierarchy of physical reasoning\ncapabilities with increasing complexity. Our benchmark tests capabilities\naccording to this hierarchy through generated physical reasoning tasks in the\nvideo game Angry Birds. This benchmark enables us to conduct a comprehensive\nagent evaluation by measuring the agent's granular physical reasoning\ncapabilities. We conduct an evaluation with human players, learning agents, and\nheuristic agents and determine their capabilities. Our evaluation shows that\nlearning agents, with good local generalization ability, still struggle to\nlearn the underlying physical reasoning capabilities and perform worse than\ncurrent state-of-the-art heuristic agents and humans.

          "description": "World models improve a learning agent's ability to efficiently operate in\ninteractive and situated environments. This work focuses on the task of\nbuilding world models of text-based game environments. Text-based games, or\ninteractive narratives, are reinforcement learning environments in which agents\nperceive and interact with the world using textual natural language. These\nenvironments contain long, multi-step puzzles or quests woven through a world\nthat is filled with hundreds of characters, locations, and objects. Our world\nmodel learns to simultaneously: (1) predict changes in the world caused by an\nagent's actions when representing the world as a knowledge graph; and (2)\ngenerate the set of contextually relevant natural language actions required to\noperate in the world. We frame this task as a Set of Sequences generation\nproblem by exploiting the inherent structure of knowledge graphs and actions\nand introduce both a transformer-based multi-task architecture and a loss\nfunction to train it. A zero-shot ablation study on never-before-seen textual\nworlds shows that our methodology significantly outperforms existing textual\nworld modeling techniques as well as the importance of each of our\ncontributions.",

          "description": "Classical machine learning frameworks assume access to a possibly large\ndataset in order to train a predictive model. In many practical applications\nhowever, data does not arrive all at once, but in batches over time. This\ncreates a natural trade-off between accuracy of a model and time to obtain such\na model. A greedy predictor could produce non-trivial predictions by\nimmediately training on batches as soon as these become available but, it may\nalso make sub-optimal use of future data. On the other hand, a tardy predictor\ncould wait for a long time to aggregate several batches into a larger dataset,\nbut ultimately deliver a much better performance. In this work, we consider\nsuch a streaming learning setting, which we dub {\\em anytime learning at\nmacroscale} (ALMA). It is an instance of anytime learning applied not at the\nlevel of a single chunk of data, but at the level of the entire sequence of\nlarge batches. We first formalize this learning setting, we then introduce\nmetrics to assess how well learners perform on the given task for a given\nmemory and compute budget, and finally we test several baseline approaches on\nstandard benchmarks repurposed for anytime learning at macroscale. The general\nfinding is that bigger models always generalize better. In particular, it is\nimportant to grow model capacity over time if the initial model is relatively\nsmall. Moreover, updating the model at an intermediate rate strikes the best\ntrade off between accuracy and time to obtain a useful predictor.",

          "description": "Federated learning is a distributed learning paradigm where multiple agents,\neach only with access to local data, jointly learn a global model. There has\nrecently been an explosion of research aiming not only to improve the accuracy\nrates of federated learning, but also provide certain guarantees around social\ngood properties such as total error. One branch of this research has taken a\ngame-theoretic approach, and in particular, prior work has viewed federated\nlearning as a hedonic game, where error-minimizing players arrange themselves\ninto federating coalitions. This past work proves the existence of stable\ncoalition partitions, but leaves open a wide range of questions, including how\nfar from optimal these stable solutions are. In this work, we motivate and\ndefine a notion of optimality given by the average error rates among federating\nagents (players). First, we provide and prove the correctness of an efficient\nalgorithm to calculate an optimal (error minimizing) arrangement of players.\nNext, we analyze the relationship between the stability and optimality of an\narrangement. First, we show that for some regions of parameter space, all\nstable arrangements are optimal (Price of Anarchy equal to 1). However, we show\nthis is not true for all settings: there exist examples of stable arrangements\nwith higher cost than optimal (Price of Anarchy greater than 1). Finally, we\ngive the first constant-factor bound on the performance gap between stability\nand optimality, proving that the total error of the worst stable solution can\nbe no higher than 9 times the total error of an optimal solution (Price of\nAnarchy bound of 9).",

Information theoretically, one can\nachieve strong error bounds with $O(k \\log n)$ samples for arbitrary $\\Sigma$\nand $w^*$; however, no efficient algorithms are known to match these guarantees\neven with $o(n)$ samples, without further assumptions on $\\Sigma$ or $w^*$. As\nfar as hardness, computational lower bounds are only known with worst-case\ndesign matrices. Random-design instances are known which are hard for the\nLasso, but these instances can generally be solved by Lasso after a simple\nchange-of-basis (i.e. preconditioning).\n\nIn this work, we give upper and lower bounds clarifying the power of\npreconditioning in sparse linear regression. First, we show that the\npreconditioned Lasso can solve a large class of sparse linear regression\nproblems nearly optimally: it succeeds whenever the dependency structure of the\ncovariates, in the sense of the Markov property, has low treewidth -- even if\n$\\Sigma$ is highly ill-conditioned. Second, we construct (for the first time)\nrandom-design instances which are provably hard for an optimally preconditioned\nLasso. In fact, we complete our treewidth classification by proving that for\nany treewidth-$t$ graph, there exists a Gaussian Markov Random Field on this\ngraph such that the preconditioned Lasso, with any choice of preconditioner,\nrequires $\\Omega(t^{1/20})$ samples to recover $O(\\log n)$-sparse signals when\ncovariates are drawn from this model.",

          "description": "The expanding usage of complex machine learning methods like deep learning\nhas led to an explosion in human activity recognition, particularly applied to\nhealth. In particular, as part of a larger body sensor network system, face and\nfull-body analysis is becoming increasingly common for evaluating health\nstatus. However, complex models which handle private and sometimes protected\ndata, raise concerns about the potential leak of identifiable data. In this\nwork, we focus on the case of a deep network model trained on images of\nindividual faces. Full-face video recordings taken from 493 individuals\nundergoing an eye-tracking based evaluation of neurological function were used.\nOutputs, gradients, intermediate layer outputs, loss, and labels were used as\ninputs for a deep network with an added support vector machine emission layer\nto recognize membership in the training data. The inference attack method and\nassociated mathematical analysis indicate that there is a low likelihood of\nunintended memorization of facial features in the deep learning model. In this\nstudy, it is showed that the named model preserves the integrity of training\ndata with reasonable confidence. The same process can be implemented in similar\nconditions for different models.",

          "description": "Graph-level representations are critical in various real-world applications,\nsuch as predicting the properties of molecules. But in practice, precise graph\nannotations are generally very expensive and time-consuming. To address this\nissue, graph contrastive learning constructs instance discrimination task which\npulls together positive pairs (augmentation pairs of the same graph) and pushes\naway negative pairs (augmentation pairs of different graphs) for unsupervised\nrepresentation learning. However, since for a query, its negatives are\nuniformly sampled from all graphs, existing methods suffer from the critical\nsampling bias issue, i.e., the negatives likely having the same semantic\nstructure with the query, leading to performance degradation. To mitigate this\nsampling bias issue, in this paper, we propose a Prototypical Graph Contrastive\nLearning (PGCL) approach. Specifically, PGCL models the underlying semantic\nstructure of the graph data via clustering semantically similar graphs into the\nsame group, and simultaneously encourages the clustering consistency for\ndifferent augmentations of the same graph. Then given a query, it performs\nnegative sampling via drawing the graphs from those clusters that differ from\nthe cluster of query, which ensures the semantic difference between query and\nits negative samples. Moreover, for a query, PGCL further reweights its\nnegative samples based on the distance between their prototypes (cluster\ncentroids) and the query prototype such that those negatives having moderate\nprototype distance enjoy relatively large weights. This reweighting strategy is\nproved to be more effective than uniform sampling. Experimental results on\nvarious graph benchmarks testify the advantages of our PGCL over\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

Recently,\npre-trained transformer-based language models (PTLMs) on large unlabeled corpus\nhave produced state-of-the-art results in many downstream natural language\nprocessing tasks. Inspired by this development, here we present molecular\nembeddings obtained by training an efficient transformer encoder model,\nreferred to as MoLFormer. This model was employed with a linear attention\nmechanism and highly paralleized training on 1D SMILES sequences of 1.1 billion\nunlabeled molecules from the PubChem and ZINC datasets. Experiments show that\nthe learned molecular representation performs competitively, when compared to\nexisting graph-based and fingerprint-based supervised learning baselines, on\nthe challenging tasks of predicting properties of QM8 and QM9 molecules.\nFurther task-specific fine-tuning of the MoLFormerr representation improves\nperformance on several of those property prediction benchmarks.

In machine learning,\nsignificant improvements are usually achieved at the price of an increasing\ncomputational complexity and thanks to bigger datasets.

Their\ncomplexity is to such an extent that these models are commonly seen as\nblack-boxes providing a prediction or a decision which can not be interpreted\nor justified. Nevertheless, whether these models are used autonomously or as a\nsimple decision-making support tool, they are already being used in machine\nlearning applications where health and human life are at stake. Therefore, it\nappears to be an obvious necessity not to blindly believe everything coming out\nof those models without a detailed understanding of their predictions or\ndecisions. Accordingly, this thesis aims at improving the interpretability of\nmodels built by a specific family of machine learning algorithms, the so-called\ntree-based methods.

Here, we provide a comprehensive\nreview and systematic comparison of eight statistical and machine learning\nmethods for probabilistic wind gust forecasting via ensemble postprocessing,\nthat can be divided in three groups: State of the art postprocessing techniques\nfrom statistics (ensemble model output statistics (EMOS), member-by-member\npostprocessing, isotonic distributional regression), established machine\nlearning methods (gradient-boosting extended EMOS, quantile regression forests)\nand neural network-based approaches (distributional regression network,\nBernstein quantile network, histogram estimation network). The methods are\nsystematically compared using six years of data from a high-resolution,\nconvection-permitting ensemble prediction system that was run operationally at\nthe German weather service, and hourly observations at 175 surface weather\nstations in Germany. While all postprocessing methods yield calibrated\nforecasts and are able to correct the systematic errors of the raw ensemble\npredictions, incorporating information from additional meteorological predictor\nvariables beyond wind gusts leads to significant improvements in forecast\nskill. In particular, we propose a flexible framework of locally adaptive\nneural networks with different probabilistic forecast types as output, which\nnot only significantly outperform all benchmark postprocessing methods but also\nlearn physically consistent relations associated with the diurnal cycle,\nespecially the evening transition of the planetary boundary layer.",

          "description": "In this paper, we present SANTA, a scalable framework to automatically\nnormalize E-commerce attribute values (e.g. \"Win 10 Pro\") to a fixed set of\npre-defined canonical values (e.g. \"Windows 10\"). Earlier works on attribute\nnormalization focused on fuzzy string matching (also referred as syntactic\nmatching in this paper). In this work, we first perform an extensive study of\nnine syntactic matching algorithms and establish that 'cosine' similarity leads\nto best results, showing 2.7% improvement over commonly used Jaccard index.\nNext, we argue that string similarity alone is not sufficient for attribute\nnormalization as many surface forms require going beyond syntactic matching\n(e.g. \"720p\" and \"HD\" are synonyms). While semantic techniques like\nunsupervised embeddings (e.g. word2vec/fastText) have shown good results in\nword similarity tasks, we observed that they perform poorly to distinguish\nbetween close canonical forms, as these close forms often occur in similar\ncontexts. We propose to learn token embeddings using a twin network with\ntriplet loss. We propose an embedding learning task leveraging raw attribute\nvalues and product titles to learn these embeddings in a self-supervised\nfashion. We show that providing supervision using our proposed task improves\nover both syntactic and unsupervised embeddings based techniques for attribute\nnormalization. Experiments on a real-world attribute normalization dataset of\n50 attributes show that the embeddings trained using our proposed approach\nobtain 2.3% improvement over best string matching and 19.3% improvement over\nbest unsupervised embeddings.",

Recent work has\nshown that autoregressive generative models with cross-entropy objective\nfunctions exhibit smooth power-law relationships, or scaling laws, that predict\nmodel quality from model size, training set size, and the available compute\nbudget. These scaling laws allow one to choose nearly optimal hyper-parameters\ngiven constraints on available training data, model parameter count, or\ntraining computation budget. In this paper, we demonstrate that acoustic models\ntrained with an auto-predictive coding loss behave as if they are subject to\nsimilar scaling laws. We extend previous work to jointly predict loss due to\nmodel size, to training set size, and to the inherent \"irreducible loss\" of the\ntask.

However,\nthese advantages come with extra coding cost/complexity and communication\noverhead (referred to as \\emph{privacy cost}) that must be considered given the\nlimited computing/communications resources at MUs/MAP, the rationality and\nincentive competition among MUs in contributing data to the MAP. This article\nproposes a novel coded FL-based framework for a privacy-aware mobile\napplication service to address these challenges.

Then, each selected MU can propose a contract to the MAP\naccording to its expected trainable local data and privacy-protected coded\ndata. To find the optimal contracts that can maximize utilities of the MAP and\nall the participating MUs while maintaining high learning quality of the whole\nsystem, we first develop a multi-principal one-agent contract-based problem\nleveraging coded FL-based multiple utility functions under the MUs' privacy\ncost, the MAP's limited computing resource, and asymmetric information between\nthe MAP and MUs. Then, we transform the problem into an equivalent\nlow-complexity problem and develop an iterative algorithm to solve it.\nExperiments with a real-world dataset show that our framework can speed up\ntraining time up to 49% and improve prediction accuracy up to 4.6 times while\nenhancing network's social welfare, i.e., total utility of all participating\nentities, up to 114% under the privacy cost consideration compared with those\nof baseline methods.",

          "description": "Attributed network embedding (ANE) is to learn low-dimensional vectors so\nthat not only the network structure but also node attributes can be preserved\nin the embedding space. Existing ANE models do not consider the specific\ncombination between graph structure and attributes. While each node has its\nstructural characteristics, such as highly-interconnected neighbors along with\ntheir certain patterns of attribute distribution, each node's neighborhood\nshould be not only depicted by multi-hop nodes, but consider certain clusters\nor social circles. To model such information, in this paper, we propose a novel\nANE model, Context Co-occurrence-aware Attributed Network Embedding (CoANE).\nThe basic idea of CoANE is to model the context attributes that each node's\ninvolved diverse patterns, and apply the convolutional mechanism to encode\npositional information by treating each attribute as a channel. The learning of\ncontext co-occurrence can capture the latent social circles of each node. To\nbetter encode structural and semantic knowledge of nodes, we devise a three-way\nobjective function, consisting of positive graph likelihood, contextual\nnegative sampling, and attribute reconstruction. We conduct experiments on five\nreal datasets in the tasks of link prediction, node label classification, and\nnode clustering. The results exhibit that CoANE can significantly outperform\nstate-of-the-art ANE models.",

Furthermore, we develop various graph neural network (GNN) models that\nproject electrodes onto the nodes of a graph, where the node features are\nrepresented as EEG channel samples collected over a trial, and nodes can be\nconnected by weighted/unweighted edges according to a flexible policy\nformulated by a neuroscientist.

Another practical advantage of our GNN-based framework is that it can\nbe used in EEG channel selection, which is critical for reducing computational\ncost, and designing portable EEG headsets.",

          "description": "Recent works demonstrated the promise of using resistive random access memory\n(ReRAM) as an emerging technology to perform inherently parallel analog domain\nin-situ matrix-vector multiplication -- the intensive and key computation in\nDNNs. With weights stored in the ReRAM crossbar cells as conductance, when the\ninput vector is applied to word lines, the matrix-vector multiplication results\ncan be generated as the current in bit lines. A key problem is that the weight\ncan be either positive or negative, but the in-situ computation assumes all\ncells on each crossbar column with the same sign. The current architectures\neither use two ReRAM crossbars for positive and negative weights, or add an\noffset to weights so that all values become positive. Neither solution is\nideal: they either double the cost of crossbars, or incur extra offset\ncircuity. To better solve this problem, this paper proposes FORMS, a\nfine-grained ReRAM-based DNN accelerator with polarized weights. Instead of\ntrying to represent the positive/negative weights, our key design principle is\nto enforce exactly what is assumed in the in-situ computation -- ensuring that\nall weights in the same column of a crossbar have the same sign. It naturally\navoids the cost of an additional crossbar. Such weights can be nicely generated\nusing alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) regularized\noptimization, which can exactly enforce certain patterns in DNN weights. To\nachieve high accuracy, we propose to use fine-grained sub-array columns, which\nprovide a unique opportunity for input zero-skipping, significantly avoiding\nunnecessary computations. It also makes the hardware much easier to implement.\nPutting all together, with the same optimized models, FORMS achieves\nsignificant throughput improvement and speed up in frame per second over ISAAC\nwith similar area cost.",

          "description": "Learning to classify time series with limited data is a practical yet\nchallenging problem. Current methods are primarily based on hand-designed\nfeature extraction rules or domain-specific data augmentation. Motivated by the\nadvances in deep speech processing models and the fact that voice data are\nunivariate temporal signals, in this paper, we propose Voice2Series (V2S), a\nnovel end-to-end approach that reprograms acoustic models for time series\nclassification, through input transformation learning and output label mapping.\nLeveraging the representation learning power of a large-scale pre-trained\nspeech processing model, on 30 different time series tasks we show that V2S\neither outperforms or is tied with state-of-the-art methods on 20 tasks, and\nimproves their average accuracy by 1.84%. We further provide a theoretical\njustification of V2S by proving its population risk is upper bounded by the\nsource risk and a Wasserstein distance accounting for feature alignment via\nreprogramming. Our results offer new and effective means to time series\nclassification.",

          "description": "Pruning the weights of randomly initialized neural networks plays an\nimportant role in the context of lottery ticket hypothesis. Ramanujan et al.\n(2020) empirically showed that only pruning the weights can achieve remarkable\nperformance instead of optimizing the weight values. However, to achieve the\nsame level of performance as the weight optimization, the pruning approach\nrequires more parameters in the networks before pruning and thus more memory\nspace. To overcome this parameter inefficiency, we introduce a novel framework\nto prune randomly initialized neural networks with iteratively randomizing\nweight values (IteRand). Theoretically, we prove an approximation theorem in\nour framework, which indicates that the randomizing operations are provably\neffective to reduce the required number of the parameters. We also empirically\ndemonstrate the parameter efficiency in multiple experiments on CIFAR-10 and\nImageNet.",

          "description": "We revisit the question of predicting both Hodge numbers $h^{1,1}$ and\n$h^{2,1}$ of complete intersection Calabi-Yau (CICY) 3-folds using machine\nlearning (ML), considering both the old and new datasets built respectively by\nCandelas-Dale-Lutken-Schimmrigk / Green-H\\\"ubsch-Lutken and by\nAnderson-Gao-Gray-Lee. In real world applications, implementing a ML system\nrarely reduces to feed the brute data to the algorithm. Instead, the typical\nworkflow starts with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) which aims at\nunderstanding better the input data and finding an optimal representation. It\nis followed by the design of a validation procedure and a baseline model.\nFinally, several ML models are compared and combined, often involving neural\nnetworks with a topology more complicated than the sequential models typically\nused in physics. By following this procedure, we improve the accuracy of ML\ncomputations for Hodge numbers with respect to the existing literature. First,\nwe obtain 97% (resp. 99%) accuracy for $h^{1,1}$ using a neural network\ninspired by the Inception model for the old dataset, using only 30% (resp. 70%)\nof the data for training. For the new one, a simple linear regression leads to\nalmost 100% accuracy with 30% of the data for training. The computation of\n$h^{2,1}$ is less successful as we manage to reach only 50% accuracy for both\ndatasets, but this is still better than the 16% obtained with a simple neural\nnetwork (SVM with Gaussian kernel and feature engineering and sequential\nconvolutional network reach at best 36%).

          "description": "Multivariable time series classification problems are increasing in\nprevalence and complexity in a variety of domains, such as biology and finance.\nWhile deep learning methods are an effective tool for these problems, they\noften lack interpretability. In this work, we propose a novel modular prototype\nlearning framework for multivariable time series classification. In the first\nstage of our framework, encoders extract features from each variable\nindependently. Prototype layers identify single-variable prototypes in the\nresulting feature spaces. The next stage of our framework represents the\nmultivariable time series sample points in terms of their similarity to these\nsingle-variable prototypes. This results in an inherently interpretable\nrepresentation of multivariable patterns, on which prototype learning is\napplied to extract representative examples i.e. multivariable prototypes. Our\nframework is thus able to explicitly identify both informative patterns in the\nindividual variables, as well as the relationships between the variables. We\nvalidate our framework on a simulated dataset with embedded patterns, as well\nas a real human activity recognition problem. Our framework attains comparable\nor superior classification performance to existing time series classification\nmethods on these tasks.

          "description": "Graphs are versatile tools for representing structured data. As a result, a\nvariety of machine learning methods have been studied for graph data analysis.\nAlthough many such learning methods depend on the measurement of differences\nbetween input graphs, defining an appropriate distance metric for graphs\nremains a controversial issue. Hence, we propose a supervised distance metric\nlearning method for the graph classification problem. Our method, named\ninterpretable graph metric learning (IGML), learns discriminative metrics in a\nsubgraph-based feature space, which has a strong graph representation\ncapability. By introducing a sparsity-inducing penalty on the weight of each\nsubgraph, IGML can identify a small number of important subgraphs that can\nprovide insight into the given classification task. Because our formulation has\na large number of optimization variables, an efficient algorithm that uses\npruning techniques based on safe screening and working set selection methods is\nalso proposed. An important property of IGML is that solution optimality is\nguaranteed because the problem is formulated as a convex problem and our\npruning strategies only discard unnecessary subgraphs. Furthermore, we show\nthat IGML is also applicable to other structured data such as itemset and\nsequence data, and that it can incorporate vertex-label similarity by using a\ntransportation-based subgraph feature. We empirically evaluate the\ncomputational efficiency and classification performance of IGML on several\nbenchmark datasets and provide some illustrative examples of how IGML\nidentifies important subgraphs from a given graph dataset.",

We support our claims\nthrough rigorous empirical evaluations of many state of the art calibration\napproaches on standard datasets. We find that many calibration approaches with\nthe likes of label smoothing, mixup etc. lower the utility of a DNN by\ndegrading its refinement. Even under natural data shift, this\ncalibration-refinement trade-off holds for the majority of calibration methods.\nThese findings call for an urgent retrospective into some popular pathways\ntaken for modern DNN calibration.",

This can be a barrier to model uptake in\nimportant domains such as biomedicine. There has been recent work on general\ninterpretable representation learning (Onoe and Durrett, 2020), but these\ndomain-agnostic representations do not readily transfer to the important domain\nof biomedicine. In this paper, we create a new entity type system and training\nset from a large corpus of biomedical texts by mapping entities to concepts in\na medical ontology, and from these to Wikipedia pages whose categories are our\ntypes. From this mapping we derive Biomedical Interpretable Entity\nRepresentations(BIERs), in which dimensions correspond to fine-grained entity\ntypes, and values are predicted probabilities that a given entity is of the\ncorresponding type. We propose a novel method that exploits BIER's final sparse\nand intermediate dense representations to facilitate model and entity type\ndebugging. We show that BIERs achieve strong performance in biomedical tasks\nincluding named entity disambiguation and entity label classification, and we\nprovide error analysis to highlight the utility of their interpretability,\nparticularly in low-supervision settings.

          "description": "Path representations are critical in a variety of transportation\napplications, such as estimating path ranking in path recommendation systems\nand estimating path travel time in navigation systems. Existing studies often\nlearn task-specific path representations in a supervised manner, which require\na large amount of labeled training data and generalize poorly to other tasks.\nWe propose an unsupervised learning framework Path InfoMax (PIM) to learn\ngeneric path representations that work for different downstream tasks. We first\npropose a curriculum negative sampling method, for each input path, to generate\na small amount of negative paths, by following the principles of curriculum\nlearning. Next, \\emph{PIM} employs mutual information maximization to learn\npath representations from both a global and a local view. In the global view,\nPIM distinguishes the representations of the input paths from those of the\nnegative paths. In the local view, \\emph{PIM} distinguishes the input path\nrepresentations from the representations of the nodes that appear only in the\nnegative paths. This enables the learned path representations to encode both\nglobal and local information at different scales. Extensive experiments on two\ndownstream tasks, ranking score estimation and travel time estimation, using\ntwo road network datasets suggest that PIM significantly outperforms other\nunsupervised methods and is also able to be used as a pre-training method to\nenhance supervised path representation learning.",

          "description": "We give a novel, unified derivation of conditional PAC-Bayesian and mutual\ninformation (MI) generalization bounds. We derive conditional MI bounds as an\ninstance, with special choice of prior, of conditional MAC-Bayesian (Mean\nApproximately Correct) bounds, itself derived from conditional PAC-Bayesian\nbounds, where `conditional' means that one can use priors conditioned on a\njoint training and ghost sample. This allows us to get nontrivial PAC-Bayes and\nMI-style bounds for general VC classes, something recently shown to be\nimpossible with standard PAC-Bayesian/MI bounds. Second, it allows us to get\nfaster rates of order $O \\left(({\\text{KL}}/n)^{\\gamma}\\right)$ for $\\gamma >\n1/2$ if a Bernstein condition holds and for exp-concave losses (with\n$\\gamma=1$), which is impossible with both standard PAC-Bayes generalization\nand MI bounds.

Nevertheless, this common practice is\nsuboptimal and can incur an unnecessary use of resources. It is more\ncost-efficient to instead leverage the low-fidelity tuning observations to\nmeasure inter-task similarity and transfer knowledge from existing to new tasks\naccordingly.

          "description": "This work presents a fully data-driven, black-box pipeline to obtain an\noptimal control policy for a multi-loop building control problem based on\nhistorical building and weather data, thus without the need for complex\nphysics-based modelling. We demonstrate the method for joint control of room\ntemperature and bidirectional EV charging to maximize the occupant thermal\ncomfort and energy savings while leaving enough energy in the EV battery for\nthe next trip. We modelled the room temperature with a recurrent neural network\nand EV charging with a piece-wise linear function. Using these models as a\nsimulation environment, we applied a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nalgorithm to obtain an optimal control policy. The learnt policy achieves on\naverage 17% energy savings over the heating season and 19% better comfort\nsatisfaction than a standard RB room temperature controller. When a\nbidirectional EV is additionally connected and a two-tariff electricity pricing\nis applied, the MIMO DRL policy successfully leverages the battery and\ndecreases the overall cost of electricity compared to two standard RB\ncontrollers, one controlling the room temperature and another controlling the\nbidirectional EV (dis-)charging. Finally, we demonstrate a successful transfer\nof the learnt DRL policy from simulation onto a real building, the DFAB HOUSE\nat Empa Duebendorf in Switzerland, achieving up to 30% energy savings while\nmaintaining similar comfort levels compared to a conventional RB room\ntemperature controller over three weeks during the heating season.",

          "description": "Federated learning (FL) has been recognized as a viable distributed learning\nparadigm which trains a machine learning model collaboratively with massive\nmobile devices in the wireless edge while protecting user privacy. Although\nvarious communication schemes have been proposed to expedite the FL process,\nmost of them have assumed ideal wireless channels which provide reliable and\nlossless communication links between the server and mobile clients.\nUnfortunately, in practical systems with limited radio resources such as\nconstraint on the training latency and constraints on the transmission power\nand bandwidth, transmission of a large number of model parameters inevitably\nsuffers from quantization errors (QE) and transmission outage (TO). In this\npaper, we consider such non-ideal wireless channels, and carry out the first\nanalysis showing that the FL convergence can be severely jeopardized by TO and\nQE, but intriguingly can be alleviated if the clients have uniform outage\nprobabilities. These insightful results motivate us to propose a robust FL\nscheme, named FedTOE, which performs joint allocation of wireless resources and\nquantization bits across the clients to minimize the QE while making the\nclients have the same TO probability. Extensive experimental results are\npresented to show the superior performance of FedTOE for a deep learning-based\nclassification task with transmission latency constraints.",

          "description": "Prediction of survival in patients diagnosed with a brain tumour is\nchallenging because of heterogeneous tumour behaviours and responses to\ntreatment. Better estimations of prognosis would support treatment planning and\npatient support. Advances in machine learning have informed development of\nclinical predictive models, but their integration into clinical practice is\nalmost non-existent. One reasons for this is the lack of interpretability of\nmodels. In this paper, we use a novel brain tumour dataset to compare two\ninterpretable rule list models against popular machine learning approaches for\nbrain tumour survival prediction. All models are quantitatively evaluated using\nstandard performance metrics. The rule lists are also qualitatively assessed\nfor their interpretability and clinical utility. The interpretability of the\nblack box machine learning models is evaluated using two post-hoc explanation\ntechniques, LIME and SHAP. Our results show that the rule lists were only\nslightly outperformed by the black box models. We demonstrate that rule list\nalgorithms produced simple decision lists that align with clinical expertise.\nBy comparison, post-hoc interpretability methods applied to black box models\nmay produce unreliable explanations of local model predictions. Model\ninterpretability is essential for understanding differences in predictive\nperformance and for integration into clinical practice.",

Unfortunately, these approaches still require centrally\ncollected unpaired records, potentially violating privacy and security issues.\nAlthough the recent federated learning (FL) allows a neural network to be\ntrained without data exchange, the basic assumption of the FL is that all\nclients have their own training data from a similar domain, which is different\nfrom our image-to-image translation scenario in which each client has images\nfrom its unique domain and the goal is to learn image translation between\ndifferent domains without accessing the target domain data. To address this,\nhere we propose a novel federated CycleGAN architecture that can learn image\ntranslation in an unsupervised manner while maintaining the data privacy.\nSpecifically, our approach arises from a novel observation that CycleGAN loss\ncan be decomposed into the sum of client specific local objectives that can be\nevaluated using only their data. This local objective decomposition allows\nmultiple clients to participate in federated CycleGAN training without\nsacrificing performance. Furthermore, our method employs novel switchable\ngenerator and discriminator architecture using Adaptive Instance Normalization\n(AdaIN) that significantly reduces the band-width requirement of the federated\nlearning.

We propose a Multi-hop Heterogeneous\nNeighborhood information Fusion graph representation learning method (MHNF).\nSpecifically, we first propose a hybrid metapath autonomous extraction model to\nefficiently extract multi-hop hybrid neighbors. Then, we propose a hop-level\nheterogeneous Information aggregation model, which selectively aggregates\ndifferent-hop neighborhood information within the same hybrid metapath.\nFinally, a hierarchical semantic attention fusion model (HSAF) is proposed,\nwhich can efficiently integrate different-hop and different-path neighborhood\ninformation respectively. This paper can solve the problem of aggregating the\nmulti-hop neighborhood information and can learn hybrid metapaths for target\ntask, reducing the limitation of manually specifying metapaths. In addition,\nHSAF can extract the internal node information of the metapaths and better\nintegrate the semantic information of different levels. Experimental results on\nreal datasets show that MHNF is superior to state-of-the-art methods in node\nclassification and clustering tasks (10.94% - 69.09% and 11.58% - 394.93%\nrelative improvement on average, respectively).",

          "description": "Two crucial requirements for a successful adoption of deep learning (DL) in\nthe wild are: (1) robustness to distributional shifts, and (2) model\ncompactness for achieving efficiency. Unfortunately, efforts towards\nsimultaneously achieving Out-of-Distribution (OOD) robustness and extreme model\ncompactness without sacrificing accuracy have mostly been unsuccessful. This\nraises an important question: \"Is the inability to create compact, accurate,\nand robust deep neural networks (CARDs) fundamental?\" To answer this question,\nwe perform a large-scale analysis for a range of popular model compression\ntechniques which uncovers several intriguing patterns. Notably, in contrast to\ntraditional pruning approaches (e.g., fine tuning and gradual magnitude\npruning), we find that \"lottery ticket-style\" pruning approaches can\nsurprisingly be used to create high performing CARDs. Specifically, we are able\nto create extremely compact CARDs that are dramatically more robust than their\nsignificantly larger and full-precision counterparts while matching (or\nbeating) their test accuracy, simply by pruning and/or quantizing. To better\nunderstand these differences, we perform sensitivity analysis in the Fourier\ndomain for CARDs trained using different data augmentation methods. Motivated\nby our analysis, we develop a simple domain-adaptive test-time ensembling\napproach (CARD-Deck) that uses a gating module to dynamically select an\nappropriate CARD from the CARD-Deck based on their spectral-similarity with\ntest samples. By leveraging complementary frequency biases of different\ncompressed models, the proposed approach builds a \"winning hand\" of CARDs that\nestablishes a new state-of-the-art on CIFAR-10-C accuracies (i.e., 96.8% clean\nand 92.75% robust) with dramatically better memory usage than their\nnon-compressed counterparts. We also present some theoretical evidences\nsupporting our empirical findings.",

          "description": "In Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, perception is both security and safety\ncritical. Despite various prior studies on its security issues, all of them\nonly consider attacks on camera- or LiDAR-based AD perception alone. However,\nproduction AD systems today predominantly adopt a Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF)\nbased design, which in principle can be more robust against these attacks under\nthe assumption that not all fusion sources are (or can be) attacked at the same\ntime. In this paper, we present the first study of security issues of MSF-based\nperception in AD systems. We directly challenge the basic MSF design assumption\nabove by exploring the possibility of attacking all fusion sources\nsimultaneously. This allows us for the first time to understand how much\nsecurity guarantee MSF can fundamentally provide as a general defense strategy\nfor AD perception.\n\nWe formulate the attack as an optimization problem to generate a\nphysically-realizable, adversarial 3D-printed object that misleads an AD system\nto fail in detecting it and thus crash into it. We propose a novel attack\npipeline that addresses two main design challenges: (1) non-differentiable\ntarget camera and LiDAR sensing systems, and (2) non-differentiable cell-level\naggregated features popularly used in LiDAR-based AD perception. We evaluate\nour attack on MSF included in representative open-source industry-grade AD\nsystems in real-world driving scenarios. Our results show that the attack\nachieves over 90% success rate across different object types and MSF. Our\nattack is also found stealthy, robust to victim positions, transferable across\nMSF algorithms, and physical-world realizable after being 3D-printed and\ncaptured by LiDAR and camera devices. To concretely assess the end-to-end\nsafety impact, we further perform simulation evaluation and show that it can\ncause a 100% vehicle collision rate for an industry-grade AD system.",

Therefore, it could be trivially distributed for\nlarge-scale clustering and few-shot tasks. Furthermore, we provides a thorough\nconvergence analysis based on point-to-set maps. Were port comprehensive\nclustering and few-shot learning experiments over various data sets, showing\nthat our method yields competitive performances, in term of accuracy and\noptimization quality, while scaling up to large problems. Using standard\ntraining on the base classes, without resorting to complex meta-learning and\nepisodic-training strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art\nfew-shot methods by significant margins, across various models, settings and\ndata sets. Surprisingly, we found that even standard clustering procedures\n(e.g., K-means), which correspond to particular, non-regularized cases of our\ngeneral model, already achieve competitive performances in comparison to the\nstate-of-the-art in few-shot learning. These surprising results point to the\nlimitations of the current few-shot benchmarks, and question the viability of a\nlarge body of convoluted few-shot learning techniques in the recent literature.",

Existing estimation\nalgorithms either require intensive training on target tasks or have\ndifficulties in evaluating the transferability between layers. We propose a\nsimple, efficient, and effective transferability measure named TransRate. With\nsingle pass through the target data, TransRate measures the transferability as\nthe mutual information between the features of target examples extracted by a\npre-trained model and labels of them. We overcome the challenge of efficient\nmutual information estimation by resorting to coding rate that serves as an\neffective alternative to entropy. TransRate is theoretically analyzed to be\nclosely related to the performance after transfer learning. Despite its\nextraordinary simplicity in 10 lines of codes, TransRate performs remarkably\nwell in extensive evaluations on 22 pre-trained models and 16 downstream tasks.",

Although much recent research\nhas focused on the development of safe reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms\nthat produce a safe policy after training, ensuring safety during training as\nwell remains an open problem. A fundamental challenge is performing exploration\nwhile still satisfying constraints in an unknown Markov decision process (MDP).\nIn this work, we address this problem for the chance-constrained setting. We\npropose a new algorithm, SAILR, that uses an intervention mechanism based on\nadvantage functions to keep the agent safe throughout training and optimizes\nthe agent's policy using off-the-shelf RL algorithms designed for unconstrained\nMDPs. Our method comes with strong guarantees on safety during both training\nand deployment (i.e., after training and without the intervention mechanism)\nand policy performance compared to the optimal safety-constrained policy. In\nour experiments, we show that SAILR violates constraints far less during\ntraining than standard safe RL and constrained MDP approaches and converges to\na well-performing policy that can be deployed safely without intervention.

The latent components are assumed to\nreside in the probability simplex, and are transformed by an unknown\npost-nonlinear mixing system. This problem finds various applications in signal\nand data analytics, e.g., nonlinear hyperspectral unmixing, image embedding,\nand nonlinear clustering. Linear mixture learning problems are already\nill-posed, as identifiability of the target latent components is hard to\nestablish in general. With unknown nonlinearity involved, the problem is even\nmore challenging. Prior work offered a function equation-based formulation for\nprovable latent component identification. However, the identifiability\nconditions are somewhat stringent and unrealistic. In addition, the\nidentifiability analysis is based on the infinite sample (i.e., population)\ncase, while the understanding for practical finite sample cases has been\nelusive. Moreover, the algorithm in the prior work trades model expressiveness\nwith computational convenience, which often hinders the learning performance.\nOur contribution is threefold. First, new identifiability conditions are\nderived under largely relaxed assumptions. Second, comprehensive sample\ncomplexity results are presented -- which are the first of the kind.

A popular strategy\nfor mitigating this problem is to learn control policies by imitating a set of\nexpert demonstrations.

To address this\nshortcoming, we propose Probabilistic Planning for Demonstration Discovery\n(P2D2), a technique for automatically discovering demonstrations without access\nto an expert. We formulate discovering demonstrations as a search problem and\nleverage widely-used planning algorithms such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree\nto find demonstration trajectories. These demonstrations are used to initialize\na policy, then refined by a generic RL algorithm. We provide theoretical\nguarantees of P2D2 finding successful trajectories, as well as bounds for its\nsampling complexity.

However, existing methods resort to flattening the brain\nconnectome (i.e., graph) through vectorization which overlooks its topological\nproperties. To address this limitation and inspired from the emerging graph\nneural networks (GNNs), we design a novel regression GNN model (namely RegGNN)\nfor predicting IQ scores from brain connectivity. On top of that, we introduce\na novel, fully modular sample selection method to select the best samples to\nlearn from for our target prediction task. However, since such deep learning\narchitectures are computationally expensive to train, we further propose a\n\\emph{learning-based sample selection} method that learns how to choose the\ntraining samples with the highest expected predictive power on unseen samples.\nFor this, we capitalize on the fact that connectomes (i.e., their adjacency\nmatrices) lie in the symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix cone. Our results\non full-scale and verbal IQ prediction outperforms comparison methods in autism\nspectrum disorder cohorts and achieves a competitive performance for\nneurotypical subjects using 3-fold cross-validation.

To evaluate both the subjectivity of the task and the performance of our\nmethod, we collected a dataset of 300 varying images from multiple sources and\nasked five people, a photographic researcher and four other persons, to\nannotate the main characters. Our analysis showed a relatively high agreement\nbetween different annotators. The proposed method achieved a promising F1 score\nof 0.83 on the full image set and 0.96 on a subset evaluated as most clear and\nimportant cases by the photographic researcher.",

Our approach devises a\nmeta-learning objective that differentiates through a sequential learning\nprocess. Specifically, we train a linear model over the representations to\nmatch different augmented views of the same image together, each view presented\nsequentially. The linear model is then evaluated on both its ability to\nclassify images it just saw, and also on images from previous iterations. This\ngives rise to representations that favor quick knowledge retention with minimal\nforgetting. We evaluate SPeCiaL in the Continual Few-Shot Learning setting, and\nshow that it can match or outperform other supervised pretraining approaches.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks can be trained in reciprocal space, by acting on the\neigenvalues and eigenvectors of suitable transfer operators in direct space.\nAdjusting the eigenvalues, while freezing the eigenvectors, yields a\nsubstantial compression of the parameter space. This latter scales by\ndefinition with the number of computing neurons. The classification scores, as\nmeasured by the displayed accuracy, are however inferior to those attained when\nthe learning is carried in direct space, for an identical architecture and by\nemploying the full set of trainable parameters (with a quadratic dependence on\nthe size of neighbor layers). In this Letter, we propose a variant of the\nspectral learning method as appeared in Giambagli et al {Nat. Comm.} 2021,\nwhich leverages on two sets of eigenvalues, for each mapping between adjacent\nlayers. The eigenvalues act as veritable knobs which can be freely tuned so as\nto (i) enhance, or alternatively silence, the contribution of the input nodes,\n(ii) modulate the excitability of the receiving nodes with a mechanism which we\ninterpret as the artificial analogue of the homeostatic plasticity. The number\nof trainable parameters is still a linear function of the network size, but the\nperformances of the trained device gets much closer to those obtained via\nconventional algorithms, these latter requiring however a considerably heavier\ncomputational cost. The residual gap between conventional and spectral\ntrainings can be eventually filled by employing a suitable decomposition for\nthe non trivial block of the eigenvectors matrix. Each spectral parameter\nreflects back on the whole set of inter-nodes weights, an attribute which we\nshall effectively exploit to yield sparse networks with stunning classification\nabilities, as compared to their homologues trained with conventional means.",

          "description": "Machine learning approaches applied to NLP are often evaluated by summarizing\ntheir performance in a single number, for example accuracy. Since most test\nsets are constructed as an i.i.d. sample from the overall data, this approach\noverly simplifies the complexity of language and encourages overfitting to the\nhead of the data distribution. As such, rare language phenomena or text about\nunderrepresented groups are not equally included in the evaluation. To\nencourage more in-depth model analyses, researchers have proposed the use of\nmultiple test sets, also called challenge sets, that assess specific\ncapabilities of a model. In this paper, we develop a framework based on this\nidea which is able to generate controlled perturbations and identify subsets in\ntext-to-scalar, text-to-text, or data-to-text settings. By applying this\nframework to the GEM generation benchmark, we propose an evaluation suite made\nof 80 challenge sets, demonstrate the kinds of analyses that it enables and\nshed light onto the limits of current generation models.",

In this paper, we define a new problem, Network Space Search\n(NSS), as searching for favorable network spaces instead of a single\narchitecture. We propose an NSS method to directly search for efficient-aware\nnetwork spaces automatically, reducing the manual effort and immense cost in\ndiscovering satisfactory ones. The resultant network spaces, named Elite\nSpaces, are discovered from Expanded Search Space with minimal human expertise\nimposed. The Pareto-efficient Elite Spaces are aligned with the Pareto front\nunder various complexity constraints and can be further served as NAS search\nspaces, benefiting differentiable NAS approaches (e.g. In CIFAR-100, an\naveragely 2.3% lower error rate and 3.7% closer to target constraint than the\nbaseline with around 90% fewer samples required to find satisfactory networks).\nMoreover, our NSS approach is capable of searching for superior spaces in\nfuture unexplored spaces, revealing great potential in searching for network\nspaces automatically.

This procedure is\nparticularly challenging due to limited field of view, poor manoeuvrability of\nthe fetoscope, poor visibility due to fluid turbidity, variability in light\nsource, and unusual position of the placenta. This may lead to increased\nprocedural time and incomplete ablation, resulting in persistent TTTS.\nComputer-assisted intervention may help overcome these challenges by expanding\nthe fetoscopic field of view through video mosaicking and providing better\nvisualization of the vessel network. However, the research and development in\nthis domain remain limited due to unavailability of high-quality data to encode\nthe intra- and inter-procedure variability. Through the \\textit{Fetoscopic\nPlacental Vessel Segmentation and Registration (FetReg)} challenge, we present\na large-scale multi-centre dataset for the development of generalized and\nrobust semantic segmentation and video mosaicking algorithms for the fetal\nenvironment with a focus on creating drift-free mosaics from long duration\nfetoscopy videos. In this paper, we provide an overview of the FetReg dataset,\nchallenge tasks, evaluation metrics and baseline methods for both segmentation\nand registration. Baseline methods results on the FetReg dataset shows that our\ndataset poses interesting challenges, offering large opportunity for the\ncreation of novel methods and models through a community effort initiative\nguided by the FetReg challenge.",

          "description": "How related are the representations learned by neural language models,\ntranslation models, and language tagging tasks? We answer this question by\nadapting an encoder-decoder transfer learning method from computer vision to\ninvestigate the structure among 100 different feature spaces extracted from\nhidden representations of various networks trained on language tasks. This\nmethod reveals a low-dimensional structure where language models and\ntranslation models smoothly interpolate between word embeddings, syntactic and\nsemantic tasks, and future word embeddings. We call this low-dimensional\nstructure a language representation embedding because it encodes the\nrelationships between representations needed to process language for a variety\nof NLP tasks. We find that this representation embedding can predict how well\neach individual feature space maps to human brain responses to natural language\nstimuli recorded using fMRI. Additionally, we find that the principal dimension\nof this structure can be used to create a metric which highlights the brain's\nnatural language processing hierarchy. This suggests that the embedding\ncaptures some part of the brain's natural language representation structure.",

          "description": "This paper presents stability analysis tools for model predictive control\n(MPC) with and without terminal weight. Stability analysis of MPC with a\nlimited horizon but without terminal weight is a long-standing open problem. By\nusing a modified value function as an Lyapunov function candidate and the\nprinciple of optimality, this paper establishes stability conditions for this\ntype of widely spread MPC algorithms. A new stability guaranteed MPC algorithm\nwithout terminal weight (MPCS) is presented. With the help of designing a new\nsublevel set defined by the value function of one-step ahead stage cost,\nconditions for checking its recursive feasibility and stability of the proposed\nMPC algorithm are presented. The new stability condition and the derived MPCS\novercome the difficulties arising in the existing terminal weight based MPC\nframework, including the need of searching a suitable terminal weight and\npossible poor performance caused by an inappropriate terminal weight. This work\nis further extended to MPC with a terminal weight for the completeness.\nNumerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed tool, whereas the existing stability analysis tools are either not\napplicable or lead to quite conservative results. It shows that the proposed\ntools offer a number of mechanisms to achieve stability: adjusting state and/or\ncontrol weights, extending the length of horizon, and adding a simple extra\nconstraint on the first or second state in the optimisation.",

          "description": "In this paper we present LiM (\"Less is More\"), a malware classification\nframework that leverages Federated Learning to detect and classify malicious\napps in a privacy-respecting manner. Information about newly installed apps is\nkept locally on users' devices, so that the provider cannot infer which apps\nwere installed by users. At the same time, input from all users is taken into\naccount in the federated learning process and they all benefit from better\nclassification performance. A key challenge of this setting is that users do\nnot have access to the ground truth (i.e. they cannot correctly identify\nwhether an app is malicious). To tackle this, LiM uses a safe semi-supervised\nensemble that maximizes classification accuracy with respect to a baseline\nclassifier trained by the service provider (i.e. the cloud). We implement LiM\nand show that the cloud server has F1 score of 95%, while clients have perfect\nrecall with only 1 false positive in >100 apps, using a dataset of 25K clean\napps and 25K malicious apps, 200 users and 50 rounds of federation.\nFurthermore, we conduct a security analysis and demonstrate that LiM is robust\nagainst both poisoning attacks by adversaries who control half of the clients,\nand inference attacks performed by an honest-but-curious cloud server. Further\nexperiments with MaMaDroid's dataset confirm resistance against poisoning\nattacks and a performance improvement due to the federation.",

We\ndownloaded a total of 120 training samples, including 58 ASD and 62 TD\nparticipants, which were obtained from the public repository: Autism Brain\nImaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE I). Our methodology and results have five main\nparts. First, we utilize a group ICA model to extract functional networks from\nthe ASD group and rank the top 20 regions of interest (ROIs). Second, we\nutilize a dictionary learning model to extract functional networks from the ASD\ngroup and rank the top 20 ROIs. Third, we merged the 40 selected ROIs from the\ntwo models together as the ASD functional networks. Fourth, we generate three\ncorresponding masks based on the 20 selected ROIs from group ICA, the 20 ROIs\nselected from dictionary learning, and the 40 combined ROIs selected from both.\nFinally, we extract ROIs for all training samples using the above three masks,\nand the calculated functional connectivity was used as features for ASD and TD\nclassification. The classification results showed that the functional networks\nderived from ICA and dictionary learning together outperform those derived from\na single ICA model or a single dictionary learning model.",

To date, work on performative\nprediction has focused on finding performatively stable models, which are the\nfixed points of repeated retraining. However, stable solutions can be far from\noptimal when evaluated in terms of the performative risk, the loss experienced\nby the decision maker when deploying a model. In this paper, we shift attention\nbeyond performative stability and focus on optimizing the performative risk\ndirectly. We identify a natural set of properties of the loss function and\nmodel-induced distribution shift under which the performative risk is convex, a\nproperty which does not follow from convexity of the loss alone. Furthermore,\nwe develop algorithms that leverage our structural assumptions to optimize the\nperformative risk with better sample efficiency than generic methods for\nderivative-free convex optimization.",

          "description": "Fine-grained location prediction on smart phones can be used to improve\napp/system performance. Application scenarios include video quality adaptation\nas a function of the 5G network quality at predicted user locations, and\naugmented reality apps that speed up content rendering based on predicted user\nlocations. Such use cases require prediction error in the same range as the GPS\nerror, and no existing works on location prediction can achieve this level of\naccuracy. We present a system for fine-grained location prediction (FGLP) of\nmobile users, based on GPS traces collected on the phones. FGLP has two\ncomponents: a federated learning framework and a prediction model. The\nframework runs on the phones of the users and also on a server that coordinates\nlearning from all users in the system. FGLP represents the user location data\nas relative points in an abstract 2D space, which enables learning across\ndifferent physical spaces. The model merges Bidirectional Long Short-Term\nMemory (BiLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), where BiLSTM learns\nthe speed and direction of the mobile users, and CNN learns information such as\nuser movement preferences. FGLP uses federated learning to protect user privacy\nand reduce bandwidth consumption. Our experimental results, using a dataset\nwith over 600,000 users, demonstrate that FGLP outperforms baseline models in\nterms of prediction accuracy. We also demonstrate that FGLP works well in\nconjunction with transfer learning, which enables model reusability. Finally,\nbenchmark results on several types of Android phones demonstrate FGLP's\nfeasibility in real life.",

          "description": "Recently developed large pre-trained language models, e.g., BERT, have\nachieved remarkable performance in many downstream natural language processing\napplications. These pre-trained language models often contain hundreds of\nmillions of parameters and suffer from high computation and latency in\nreal-world applications. It is desirable to reduce the computation overhead of\nthe models for fast training and inference while keeping the model performance\nin downstream applications. Several lines of work utilize knowledge\ndistillation to compress the teacher model to a smaller student model. However,\nthey usually discard the teacher's knowledge when in inference. Differently, in\nthis paper, we propose RefBERT to leverage the knowledge learned from the\nteacher, i.e., facilitating the pre-computed BERT representation on the\nreference sample and compressing BERT into a smaller student model. To\nguarantee our proposal, we provide theoretical justification on the loss\nfunction and the usage of reference samples. Significantly, the theoretical\nresult shows that including the pre-computed teacher's representations on the\nreference samples indeed increases the mutual information in learning the\nstudent model. Finally, we conduct the empirical evaluation and show that our\nRefBERT can beat the vanilla TinyBERT over 8.1\\% and achieves more than 94\\% of\nthe performance of $\\BERTBASE$ on the GLUE benchmark. Meanwhile, RefBERT is\n7.4x smaller and 9.5x faster on inference than BERT$_{\\rm BASE}$.",

          "description": "A key limitation in using various modern methods of machine learning in\ndeveloping feedback control policies is the lack of appropriate methodologies\nto analyze their long-term dynamics, in terms of making any sort of guarantees\n(even statistically) about robustness. The central reasons for this are largely\ndue to the so-called curse of dimensionality, combined with the black-box\nnature of the resulting control policies themselves. This paper aims at the\nfirst of these issues. Although the full state space of a system may be quite\nlarge in dimensionality, it is a common feature of most model-based control\nmethods that the resulting closed-loop systems demonstrate dominant dynamics\nthat are rapidly driven to some lower-dimensional sub-space within. In this\nwork we argue that the dimensionality of this subspace is captured by tools\nfrom fractal geometry, namely various notions of a fractional dimension. We\nthen show that the dimensionality of trajectories induced by model free\nreinforcement learning agents can be influenced adding a post processing\nfunction to the agents reward signal. We verify that the dimensionality\nreduction is robust to noise being added to the system and show that that the\nmodified agents are more actually more robust to noise and push disturbances in\ngeneral for the systems we examined.",

          "description": "In label-noise learning, the transition matrix plays a key role in building\nstatistically consistent classifiers. Existing consistent estimators for the\ntransition matrix have been developed by exploiting anchor points. However, the\nanchor-point assumption is not always satisfied in real scenarios. In this\npaper, we propose an end-to-end framework for solving label-noise learning\nwithout anchor points, in which we simultaneously optimize two objectives: the\ncross entropy loss between the noisy label and the predicted probability by the\nneural network, and the volume of the simplex formed by the columns of the\ntransition matrix. Our proposed framework can identify the transition matrix if\nthe clean class-posterior probabilities are sufficiently scattered. This is by\nfar the mildest assumption under which the transition matrix is provably\nidentifiable and the learned classifier is statistically consistent.\nExperimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and\nrobustness of the proposed method.",

The loss\nfunction is inspired by, and embodies, the structure of established stochastic\nnumerical integrators (here, Euler-Maruyama and Milstein); our approximations\ncan thus benefit from error analysis of these underlying numerical schemes.\nThey also lend themselves naturally to \"physics-informed\" gray-box\nidentification when approximate coarse models, such as mean field equations,\nare available.

          "description": "Large-scale modern data often involves estimation and testing for\nhigh-dimensional unknown parameters. It is desirable to identify the sparse\nsignals, ``the needles in the haystack'', with accuracy and false discovery\ncontrol. However, the unprecedented complexity and heterogeneity in modern data\nstructure require new machine learning tools to effectively exploit\ncommonalities and to robustly adjust for both sparsity and heterogeneity. In\naddition, estimates for high-dimensional parameters often lack uncertainty\nquantification. In this paper, we propose a novel Spike-and-Nonparametric\nmixture prior (SNP) -- a spike to promote the sparsity and a nonparametric\nstructure to capture signals. In contrast to the state-of-the-art methods, the\nproposed methods solve the estimation and testing problem at once with several\nmerits: 1) an accurate sparsity estimation; 2) point estimates with\nshrinkage/soft-thresholding property; 3) credible intervals for uncertainty\nquantification; 4) an optimal multiple testing procedure that controls false\ndiscovery rate.

          "description": "Recent work has discovered that deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies\nare vulnerable to adversarial examples. These attacks mislead the policy of DRL\nagents by perturbing the state of the environment observed by agents. They are\nfeasible in principle but too slow to fool DRL policies in real time. We\npropose a new attack to fool DRL policies that is both effective and efficient\nenough to be mounted in real time. We utilize the Universal Adversarial\nPerturbation (UAP) method to compute effective perturbations independent of the\nindividual inputs to which they are applied. Via an extensive evaluation using\nAtari 2600 games, we show that our technique is effective, as it fully degrades\nthe performance of both deterministic and stochastic policies (up to 100%, even\nwhen the $l_\\infty$ bound on the perturbation is as small as 0.005). We also\nshow that our attack is efficient, incurring an online computational cost of\n0.027ms on average. It is faster compared to the response time (0.6ms on\naverage) of agents with different DRL policies, and considerably faster than\nprior attacks (2.7ms on average). Furthermore, we demonstrate that known\ndefenses are ineffective against universal perturbations. We propose an\neffective detection technique which can form the basis for robust defenses\nagainst attacks based on universal perturbations.",

          "description": "Counterfactuals, serving as one of the emerging type of model\ninterpretations, have recently received attention from both researchers and\npractitioners. Counterfactual explanations formalize the exploration of\n``what-if'' scenarios, and are an instance of example-based reasoning using a\nset of hypothetical data samples. Counterfactuals essentially show how the\nmodel decision alters with input perturbations. Existing methods for generating\ncounterfactuals are mainly algorithm-based, which are time-inefficient and\nassume the same counterfactual universe for different queries. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a Model-based Counterfactual Synthesizer (MCS)\nframework for interpreting machine learning models. We first analyze the\nmodel-based counterfactual process and construct a base synthesizer using a\nconditional generative adversarial net (CGAN). To better approximate the\ncounterfactual universe for those rare queries, we novelly employ the umbrella\nsampling technique to conduct the MCS framework training. Besides, we also\nenhance the MCS framework by incorporating the causal dependence among\nattributes with model inductive bias, and validate its design correctness from\nthe causality identification perspective. Experimental results on several\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness as well as efficiency of our proposed\nMCS framework, and verify the advantages compared with other alternatives.",

Policies learned through\nself-play may adopt arbitrary conventions and implicitly rely on multi-step\nreasoning based on fragile assumptions about other agents' actions and thus\nfail when paired with humans or independently trained agents at test time. To\naddress this, we present off-belief learning (OBL).

When $\\pi_0$ is uniform random, OBL converges to an optimal policy\nthat does not rely on inferences based on other agents' behavior (an optimal\ngrounded policy). OBL can be iterated in a hierarchy, where the optimal policy\nfrom one level becomes the input to the next, thereby introducing multi-level\ncognitive reasoning in a controlled manner. Unlike existing approaches, which\nmay converge to any equilibrium policy, OBL converges to a unique policy,\nmaking it suitable for zero-shot coordination (ZSC).

          "description": "Estimation of the longitudinal slip ratio of tires is important in boosting\nthe control performance of the vehicle under driving and braking conditions. In\nthis paper, the slip ratio is estimated using four machine learning algorithms\n(Neural Network, Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest and Support Vector\nMachine) based on the acceleration signals from the tri-axial MEMS\naccelerometers utilized in the intelligent tire system. The experimental data\nare collected through the MTS experimental platform. The corresponding\nacceleration signals within the tire contact patch are extracted after\nfiltering to be used for the training the aforesaid machine learning\nalgorithms. A comparison is provided between the implemented ML algorithms\nusing a 10-fold CV. NRMS errors in the CV results indicate that NN has the\nhighest accuracy in comparison with other techniques. The NRSM errors of NN,\nGBM, RF, and SVM are 2.59\\%, 3.30\\%, 4.21\\%, and 5.34\\%, respectively. Among\nthese techniques, GBM has a more stable results as it has the smallest output\nvariance. The present study with the fusion of intelligent tire system and\nmachine learning algorithms paves the way for the accurate estimation of tire\nslip ratio, which is critical for the development of reliable vehicle control\nalgorithms.",

          "description": "The theory of spectral filtering is a remarkable tool to understand the\nstatistical properties of learning with kernels. For least squares, it allows\nto derive various regularization schemes that yield faster convergence rates of\nthe excess risk than with Tikhonov regularization. This is typically achieved\nby leveraging classical assumptions called source and capacity conditions,\nwhich characterize the difficulty of the learning task. In order to understand\nestimators derived from other loss functions, Marteau-Ferey et al. have\nextended the theory of Tikhonov regularization to generalized self concordant\nloss functions (GSC), which contain, e.g., the logistic loss. In this paper, we\ngo a step further and show that fast and optimal rates can be achieved for GSC\nby using the iterated Tikhonov regularization scheme, which is intrinsically\nrelated to the proximal point method in optimization, and overcomes the\nlimitation of the classical Tikhonov regularization.",

Backdoor attackers tamper with training\ndata to embed a vulnerability in models that are trained on that data. This\nvulnerability is then activated at inference time by placing a \"trigger\" into\nthe model's input. Typical backdoor attacks insert the trigger directly into\nthe training data, although the presence of such an attack may be visible upon\ninspection. In contrast, the Hidden Trigger Backdoor Attack achieves poisoning\nwithout placing a trigger into the training data at all. However, this hidden\ntrigger attack is ineffective at poisoning neural networks trained from\nscratch. We develop a new hidden trigger attack, Sleeper Agent, which employs\ngradient matching, data selection, and target model re-training during the\ncrafting process. Sleeper Agent is the first hidden trigger backdoor attack to\nbe effective against neural networks trained from scratch. We demonstrate its\neffectiveness on ImageNet and in black-box settings.

          "description": "Petabytes of data are generated each day by emerging Internet of Things\n(IoT), but only few of them can be finally collected and used for Machine\nLearning (ML) purposes due to the apprehension of data & privacy leakage, which\nseriously retarding ML's growth. To alleviate this problem, Federated learning\nis proposed to perform model training by multiple clients' combined data\nwithout the dataset sharing within the cluster. Nevertheless, federated\nlearning introduces massive communication overhead as the synchronized data in\neach epoch is of the same size as the model, and thereby leading to a low\ncommunication efficiency. Consequently, variant methods mainly focusing on the\ncommunication rounds reduction and data compression are proposed to reduce the\ncommunication overhead of federated learning. In this paper, we propose\nOverlap-FedAvg, a framework that parallels the model training phase with model\nuploading & downloading phase, so that the latter phase can be totally covered\nby the former phase. Compared to vanilla FedAvg, Overlap-FedAvg is further\ndeveloped with a hierarchical computing strategy, a data compensation mechanism\nand a nesterov accelerated gradients~(NAG) algorithm. Besides, Overlap-FedAvg\nis orthogonal to many other compression methods so that they can be applied\ntogether to maximize the utilization of the cluster. Furthermore, the\ntheoretical analysis is provided to prove the convergence of the proposed\nOverlap-FedAvg framework. Extensive experiments on both conventional and\nrecurrent tasks with multiple models and datasets also demonstrate that the\nproposed Overlap-FedAvg framework substantially boosts the federated learning\nprocess.",

We\npropose a classification system based on a simple neural network architecture\nthat scores the classical stages as well as pre-REM sleep in mice. When\nrestricted to the classical stages, the optimized network showed\nstate-of-the-art classification performance with an out-of-sample F1 score of\n0.95 in male C57BL/6J mice.

The result is\ncomparable to previous attempts to score transitional stages in other species\nsuch as transition sleep in rats or N1 sleep in humans. Nevertheless, we\nobserved that the sequence of predictions including pre-REM typically\ntransitioned from Non-REM to REM reflecting sleep dynamics observed by human\nscorers.

          "description": "Thanks to the combination of state-of-the-art accelerators and highly\noptimized open software frameworks, there has been tremendous progress in the\nperformance of deep neural networks. While these developments have been\nresponsible for many breakthroughs, progress towards solving large-scale\nproblems, such as video encoding and semantic segmentation in 3D, is hampered\nbecause access to on-premise memory is often limited. Instead of relying on\n(optimal) checkpointing or invertibility of the network layers -- to recover\nthe activations during backpropagation -- we propose to approximate the\ngradient of convolutional layers in neural networks with a multi-channel\nrandomized trace estimation technique. Compared to other methods, this approach\nis simple, amenable to analyses, and leads to a greatly reduced memory\nfootprint. Even though the randomized trace estimation introduces stochasticity\nduring training, we argue that this is of little consequence as long as the\ninduced errors are of the same order as errors in the gradient due to the use\nof stochastic gradient descent. We discuss the performance of networks trained\nwith stochastic backpropagation and how the error can be controlled while\nmaximizing memory usage and minimizing computational overhead.",

The Italian National Institute of\nStatistics (Istat) is currently carrying out several Big Data pilot studies.\nOne of these studies, the ICT Big Data pilot, aims at exploiting massive\namounts of textual data automatically scraped from the websites of Italian\nenterprises in order to predict a set of target variables (e.g. e-commerce)\nthat are routinely observed by the traditional ICT Survey. In this paper, we\nshow that Deep Learning techniques can successfully address this problem.\nEssentially, we tackle a text classification task: an algorithm must learn to\ninfer whether an Italian enterprise performs e-commerce from the textual\ncontent of its website. To reach this goal, we developed a sophisticated\nprocessing pipeline and evaluated its performance through extensive\nexperiments. Our pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks and relies on Word\nEmbeddings to encode raw texts into grayscale images (i.e. normalized numeric\nmatrices). Web-scraped texts are huge and have very low signal to noise ratio:\nto overcome these issues, we adopted a framework known as False Positive\nReduction, which has seldom (if ever) been applied before to text\nclassification tasks. Several original contributions enable our processing\npipeline to reach good classification results.

          "description": "Among interpretable machine learning methods, the class of Generalised\nAdditive Neural Networks (GANNs) is referred to as Self-Explaining Neural\nNetworks (SENN) because of the linear dependence on explicit functions of the\ninputs. In binary classification this shows the precise weight that each input\ncontributes towards the logit. The nomogram is a graphical representation of\nthese weights. We show that functions of individual and pairs of variables can\nbe derived from a functional Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) representation,\nenabling an efficient feature selection to be carried by application of the\nlogistic Lasso. This process infers the structure of GANNs which otherwise\nneeds to be predefined. As this method is particularly suited for tabular data,\nit starts by fitting a generic flexible model, in this case a Multi-layer\nPerceptron (MLP) to which the ANOVA decomposition is applied. This has the\nfurther advantage that the resulting GANN can be replicated as a SENN, enabling\nfurther refinement of the univariate and bivariate component functions to take\nplace. The component functions are partial responses hence the SENN is a\npartial response network. The Partial Response Network (PRN) is equally as\ntransparent as a traditional logistic regression model, but capable of\nnon-linear classification with comparable or superior performance to the\noriginal MLP. In other words, the PRN is a fully interpretable representation\nof the MLP, at the level of univariate and bivariate effects. The performance\nof the PRN is shown to be competitive for benchmark data, against\nstate-of-the-art machine learning methods including GBM, SVM and Random\nForests. It is also compared with spline-based Sparse Additive Models (SAM)\nshowing that a semi-parametric representation of the GAM as a neural network\ncan be as effective as the SAM though less constrained by the need to set\nspline nodes.",

The World\nHealth Organization (WHO) has provided guidelines on how to reduce the spread\nof the virus and one of the most important measures is social distancing.\nMaintaining a minimum of one meter distance from other people is strongly\nsuggested to reduce the risk of infection. This has created a strong interest\nin monitoring the social distances either as a safety measure or to study how\nthe measures have affected human behavior and country-wise differences in this.\nThe need for automatic social distance estimation algorithms is evident, but\nthere is no suitable test benchmark for such algorithms. Collecting images with\nmeasured ground-truth pair-wise distances between all the people using\ndifferent camera settings is cumbersome. Furthermore, performance evaluation\nfor social distance estimation algorithms is not straightforward and there is\nno widely accepted evaluation protocol. In this paper, we provide a dataset of\nvarying images with measured pair-wise social distances under different camera\npositionings and focal length values. We suggest a performance evaluation\nprotocol and provide a benchmark to easily evaluate social distance estimation\nalgorithms. We also propose a method for automatic social distance estimation.\nOur method takes advantage of object detection and human pose estimation. It\ncan be applied on any single image as long as focal length and sensor size\ninformation are known. The results on our benchmark are encouraging with 92%\nhuman detection rate and only 28.9% average error in distance estimation among\nthe detected people.",

In tabular Markov Decision Problems (MDPs), under persistent\nexploration and suitable parameterization, global optimality may be obtained.\nBy contrast, in continuous space, the non-convexity poses a pathological\nchallenge as evidenced by existing convergence results being mostly limited to\nstationarity or arbitrary local extrema. To close this gap, we step towards\npersistent exploration in continuous space through policy parameterizations\ndefined by distributions of heavier tails defined by tail-index parameter\nalpha, which increases the likelihood of jumping in state space. Doing so\ninvalidates smoothness conditions of the score function common to PG. Thus, we\nestablish how the convergence rate to stationarity depends on the policy's tail\nindex alpha, a Holder continuity parameter, integrability conditions, and an\nexploration tolerance parameter introduced here for the first time. Further, we\ncharacterize the dependence of the set of local maxima on the tail index\nthrough an exit and transition time analysis of a suitably defined Markov\nchain, identifying that policies associated with Levy Processes of a heavier\ntail converge to wider peaks. This phenomenon yields improved stability to\nperturbations in supervised learning, which we corroborate also manifests in\nimproved performance of policy search, especially when myopic and farsighted\nincentives are misaligned.",

          "description": "Recent works have shown that interval bound propagation (IBP) can be used to\ntrain verifiably robust neural networks. Reseachers observe an intriguing\nphenomenon on these IBP trained networks: CROWN, a bounding method based on\ntight linear relaxation, often gives very loose bounds on these networks. We\nalso observe that most neurons become dead during the IBP training process,\nwhich could hurt the representation capability of the network. In this paper,\nwe study the relationship between IBP and CROWN, and prove that CROWN is always\ntighter than IBP when choosing appropriate bounding lines. We further propose a\nrelaxed version of CROWN, linear bound propagation (LBP), that can be used to\nverify large networks to obtain lower verified errors than IBP. We also design\na new activation function, parameterized ramp function (ParamRamp), which has\nmore diversity of neuron status than ReLU.

In order to rely on\nvirtual tests the employed sensor models have to be validated. For this reason,\nit is necessary to quantify the discrepancy between simulation and reality in\norder to determine whether a certain fidelity is sufficient for a desired\nintended use. There exists no sound method to measure this\nsimulation-to-reality gap of radar perception for autonomous driving. We\naddress this problem by introducing a multi-layered evaluation approach, which\nconsists of a combination of an explicit and an implicit sensor model\nevaluation.

In order to demonstrate the method, we evaluated the\nfidelity of three typical radar model types (ideal, data-driven, ray\ntracing-based) and their applicability for virtually testing radar-based\nmulti-object tracking.

          "description": "Pre-trained language models have been successful on text classification\ntasks, but are prone to learning spurious correlations from biased datasets,\nand are thus vulnerable when making inferences in a new domain. Prior works\nreveal such spurious patterns via post-hoc explanation algorithms which compute\nthe importance of input features. Further, the model is regularized to align\nthe importance scores with human knowledge, so that the unintended model\nbehaviors are eliminated. However, such a regularization technique lacks\nflexibility and coverage, since only importance scores towards a pre-defined\nlist of features are adjusted, while more complex human knowledge such as\nfeature interaction and pattern generalization can hardly be incorporated. In\nthis work, we propose to refine a learned language model for a target domain by\ncollecting human-provided compositional explanations regarding observed biases.\nBy parsing these explanations into executable logic rules, the human-specified\nrefinement advice from a small set of explanations can be generalized to more\ntraining examples. We additionally introduce a regularization term allowing\nadjustments for both importance and interaction of features to better rectify\nmodel behavior.

In our quantitative evaluation, we compare the models\nbased on the smoothed BLEU-4, METEOR, and ROUGE-L machine translation metrics,\nand in our qualitative evaluation, we perform a manual open-coding of the most\ncommon errors committed by the models when compared to ground truth captions.\nOur investigation reveals new insights into the relationship between\nmetric-based performance and model prediction errors grounded in an empirically\nderived error taxonomy that can be used to drive future research efforts",

          "description": "Recent results in supervised learning suggest that while overparameterized\nmodels have the capacity to overfit, they in fact generalize quite well. We ask\nwhether the same phenomenon occurs for offline contextual bandits. Our results\nare mixed. Value-based algorithms benefit from the same generalization behavior\nas overparameterized supervised learning, but policy-based algorithms do not.\nWe show that this discrepancy is due to the \\emph{action-stability} of their\nobjectives. An objective is action-stable if there exists a prediction\n(action-value vector or action distribution) which is optimal no matter which\naction is observed. While value-based objectives are action-stable,\npolicy-based objectives are unstable. We formally prove upper bounds on the\nregret of overparameterized value-based learning and lower bounds on the regret\nfor policy-based algorithms. In our experiments with large neural networks,\nthis gap between action-stable value-based objectives and unstable policy-based\nobjectives leads to significant performance differences.",

          "description": "Ensemble classifiers have been investigated by many in the artificial\nintelligence and machine learning community. Majority voting and weighted\nmajority voting are two commonly used combination schemes in ensemble learning.\nHowever, understanding of them is incomplete at best, with some properties even\nmisunderstood. In this paper, we present a group of properties of these two\nschemes formally under a dataset-level geometric framework. Two key factors,\nevery component base classifier's performance and dissimilarity between each\npair of component classifiers are evaluated by the same metric - the Euclidean\ndistance. Consequently, ensembling becomes a deterministic problem and the\nperformance of an ensemble can be calculated directly by a formula. We prove\nseveral theorems of interest and explain their implications for ensembles. In\nparticular, we compare and contrast the effect of the number of component\nclassifiers on these two types of ensemble schemes. Empirical investigation is\nalso conducted to verify the theoretical results when other metrics such as\naccuracy are used. We believe that the results from this paper are very useful\nfor us to understand the fundamental properties of these two combination\nschemes and the principles of ensemble classifiers in general. The results are\nalso helpful for us to investigate some issues in ensemble classifiers, such as\nensemble performance prediction, selecting a small number of base classifiers\nto obtain efficient and effective ensembles.",

          "description": "Adversarial training has been the topic of dozens of studies and a leading\nmethod for defending against adversarial attacks. Yet, it remains largely\nunknown (a) how adversarially-robust ImageNet classifiers (R classifiers)\ngeneralize to out-of-distribution examples; and (b) how their generalization\ncapability relates to their hidden representations. In this paper, we perform a\nthorough, systematic study to answer these two questions across AlexNet,\nGoogLeNet, and ResNet-50 architectures. We found that while standard ImageNet\nclassifiers have a strong texture bias, their R counterparts rely heavily on\nshapes. Remarkably, adversarial training induces three simplicity biases into\nhidden neurons in the process of 'robustifying' the network. That is, each\nconvolutional neuron in R networks often changes to detecting (1) pixel-wise\nsmoother patterns i.e. a mechanism that blocks high-frequency noise from\npassing through the network; (2) more lower-level features i.e. textures and\ncolors (instead of objects); and (3) fewer types of inputs. Our findings reveal\nthe interesting mechanisms that made networks more adversarially robust and\nalso explain some recent findings. Our findings reveal the interesting\nmechanisms that made networks more adversarially robust and also explain some\nrecent findings e.g. why R networks benefit from much larger capacity (Xie and\nYuille, 2020) and can act as a strong image prior in image synthesis (Santurkar\net al., 2019).",

          "description": "Neural architecture search (NAS) has seen a steep rise in interest over the\nlast few years. Many algorithms for NAS consist of searching through a space of\narchitectures by iteratively choosing an architecture, evaluating its\nperformance by training it, and using all prior evaluations to come up with the\nnext choice. The evaluation step is noisy - the final accuracy varies based on\nthe random initialization of the weights. Prior work has focused on devising\nnew search algorithms to handle this noise, rather than quantifying or\nunderstanding the level of noise in architecture evaluations. In this work, we\nshow that (1) the simplest hill-climbing algorithm is a powerful baseline for\nNAS, and (2), when the noise in popular NAS benchmark datasets is reduced to a\nminimum, hill-climbing to outperforms many popular state-of-the-art algorithms.\nWe further back up this observation by showing that the number of local minima\nis substantially reduced as the noise decreases, and by giving a theoretical\ncharacterization of the performance of local search in NAS. Based on our\nfindings, for NAS research we suggest (1) using local search as a baseline, and\n(2) denoising the training pipeline when possible.",

Such data records the aggregated counts of events\nsolely during specific time intervals -- such as the number of patients\nadmitted to the hospital or the volume of vehicles passing traffic loop\ndetectors -- and not the exact occurrence time of the events. First, we\nestablish the Mean Behavior Poisson (MBP) process, a novel Poisson process with\na direct parameter correspondence to the popular self-exciting Hawkes process.\nThe event intensity function of the MBP is the expected intensity over all\npossible Hawkes realizations with the same parameter set. We fit MBP in the\ninterval-censored setting using an interval-censored Poisson log-likelihood\n(IC-LL). We use the parameter equivalence to uncover the parameters of the\nassociated Hawkes process. Second, we introduce two novel exogenous functions\nto distinguish the exogenous from the endogenous events. We propose the\nmulti-impulse exogenous function when the exogenous events are observed as\nevent time and the latent homogeneous Poisson process exogenous function when\nthe exogenous events are presented as interval-censored volumes. Third, we\nprovide several approximation methods to estimate the intensity and compensator\nfunction of MBP when no analytical solution exists. Fourth and finally, we\nconnect the interval-censored loss of MBP to a broader class of Bregman\ndivergence-based functions. Using the connection, we show that the current\nstate of the art in popularity estimation (Hawkes Intensity Process (HIP)\n(Rizoiu et al.,2017b)) is a particular case of the MBP process.

          "description": "Due to advances in deep learning, the performance of automatic beat and\ndownbeat tracking in musical audio signals has seen great improvement in recent\nyears. In training such deep learning based models, data augmentation has been\nfound an important technique. However, existing data augmentation methods for\nthis task mainly target at balancing the distribution of the training data with\nrespect to their tempo. In this paper, we investigate another approach for data\naugmentation, to account for the composition of the training data in terms of\nthe percussive and non-percussive sound sources. Specifically, we propose to\nemploy a blind drum separation model to segregate the drum and non-drum sounds\nfrom each training audio signal, filtering out training signals that are\ndrumless, and then use the obtained drum and non-drum stems to augment the\ntraining data. We report experiments on four completely unseen test sets,\nvalidating the effectiveness of the proposed method, and accordingly the\nimportance of drum sound composition in the training data for beat and downbeat\ntracking.",

          "description": "In biopharmaceutical manufacturing, fermentation processes play a critical\nrole on productivity and profit. A fermentation process uses living cells with\ncomplex biological mechanisms, and this leads to high variability in the\nprocess outputs. By building on the biological mechanisms of protein and\nimpurity growth, we introduce a stochastic model to characterize the\naccumulation of the protein and impurity levels in the fermentation process.\nHowever, a common challenge in industry is the availability of only very\nlimited amount of data especially in the development and early stage of\nproduction. This adds an additional layer of uncertainty, referred to as model\nrisk, due to the difficulty of estimating the model parameters with limited\ndata. In this paper, we study the harvesting decision for a fermentation\nprocess under model risk. In particular, we adopt a Bayesian approach to update\nthe unknown parameters of the growth-rate distributions, and use the resulting\nposterior distributions to characterize the impact of model risk on\nfermentation output variability. The harvesting problem is formulated as a\nMarkov decision process model with knowledge states that summarize the\nposterior distributions and hence incorporate the model risk in\ndecision-making. The resulting model is solved by using a reinforcement\nlearning algorithm based on Bayesian sparse sampling. We provide analytical\nresults on the structure of the optimal policy and its objective function, and\nexplicitly study the impact of model risk on harvesting decisions. Our case\nstudies at MSD Animal Health demonstrate that the proposed model and solution\napproach improve the harvesting decisions in real life by achieving\nsubstantially higher average output from a fermentation batch along with lower\nbatch-to-batch variability.",

          "description": "Recommender Systems (RS) have employed knowledge distillation which is a\nmodel compression technique training a compact student model with the knowledge\ntransferred from a pre-trained large teacher model. Recent work has shown that\ntransferring knowledge from the teacher's intermediate layer significantly\nimproves the recommendation quality of the student. However, they transfer the\nknowledge of individual representation point-wise and thus have a limitation in\nthat primary information of RS lies in the relations in the representation\nspace. This paper proposes a new topology distillation approach that guides the\nstudent by transferring the topological structure built upon the relations in\nthe teacher space. We first observe that simply making the student learn the\nwhole topological structure is not always effective and even degrades the\nstudent's performance. We demonstrate that because the capacity of the student\nis highly limited compared to that of the teacher, learning the whole\ntopological structure is daunting for the student. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel method named Hierarchical Topology Distillation (HTD) which\ndistills the topology hierarchically to cope with the large capacity gap. Our\nextensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed method\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors. We also provide\nin-depth analyses to ascertain the benefit of distilling the topology for RS.",

          "description": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a wide class of connectionist models for\ngraph processing. They perform an iterative message passing operation on each\nnode and its neighbors, to solve classification/ clustering tasks --- on some\nnodes or on the whole graph --- collecting all such messages, regardless of\ntheir order. Despite the differences among the various models belonging to this\nclass, most of them adopt the same computation scheme, based on a local\naggregation mechanism and, intuitively, the local computation framework is\nmainly responsible for the expressive power of GNNs. In this paper, we prove\nthat the Weisfeiler--Lehman test induces an equivalence relationship on the\ngraph nodes that exactly corresponds to the unfolding equivalence, defined on\nthe original GNN model. Therefore, the results on the expressive power of the\noriginal GNNs can be extended to general GNNs which, under mild conditions, can\nbe proved capable of approximating, in probability and up to any precision, any\nfunction on graphs that respects the unfolding equivalence.",

          "description": "Although the adoption rate of deep neural networks (DNNs) has tremendously\nincreased in recent years, a solution for their vulnerability against\nadversarial examples has not yet been found. As a result, substantial research\nefforts are dedicated to fix this weakness, with many studies typically using a\nsubset of source images to generate adversarial examples, treating every image\nin this subset as equal. We demonstrate that, in fact, not every source image\nis equally suited for this kind of assessment. To do so, we devise a\nlarge-scale model-to-model transferability scenario for which we meticulously\nanalyze the properties of adversarial examples, generated from every suitable\nsource image in ImageNet by making use of two of the most frequently deployed\nattacks. In this transferability scenario, which involves seven distinct DNN\nmodels, including the recently proposed vision transformers, we reveal that it\nis possible to have a difference of up to $12.5\\%$ in model-to-model\ntransferability success, $1.01$ in average $L_2$ perturbation, and $0.03$\n($8/225$) in average $L_{\\infty}$ perturbation when $1,000$ source images are\nsampled randomly among all suitable candidates. We then take one of the first\nsteps in evaluating the robustness of images used to create adversarial\nexamples, proposing a number of simple but effective methods to identify\nunsuitable source images, thus making it possible to mitigate extreme cases in\nexperimentation and support high-quality benchmarking.",

          "description": "Recently, linear regression models, such as EASE and SLIM, have shown to\noften produce rather competitive results against more sophisticated deep\nlearning models. On the other side, the (weighted) matrix factorization\napproaches have been popular choices for recommendation in the past and widely\nadopted in the industry. In this work, we aim to theoretically understand the\nrelationship between these two approaches, which are the cornerstones of\nmodel-based recommendations. Through the derivation and analysis of the\nclosed-form solutions for two basic regression and matrix factorization\napproaches, we found these two approaches are indeed inherently related but\nalso diverge in how they \"scale-down\" the singular values of the original\nuser-item interaction matrix. This analysis also helps resolve the questions\nrelated to the regularization parameter range and model complexities. We\nfurther introduce a new learning algorithm in searching (hyper)parameters for\nthe closed-form solution and utilize it to discover the nearby models of the\nexisting solutions. The experimental results demonstrate that the basic models\nand their closed-form solutions are indeed quite competitive against the\nstate-of-the-art models, thus, confirming the validity of studying the basic\nmodels.

Compared to\ntraditional \"test-time\" defenses, these defense mechanisms \"dynamically\nretrain\" the model based on test time input via transductive learning; and\ntheoretically, attacking these defenses boils down to bilevel optimization,\nwhich seems to raise the difficulty for adaptive attacks. In this paper, we\nfirst formalize and analyze modeling aspects of transductive robustness. Then,\nwe propose the principle of attacking model space for solving bilevel attack\nobjectives, and present an instantiation of the principle which breaks previous\ntransductive defenses. These attacks thus point to significant difficulties in\nthe use of transductive learning to improve adversarial robustness.

          "description": "Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to improve the generalization of several\nrelated tasks by learning them jointly. As a comparison, in addition to the\njoint training scheme, modern meta-learning allows unseen tasks with limited\nlabels during the test phase, in the hope of fast adaptation over them. Despite\nthe subtle difference between MTL and meta-learning in the problem formulation,\nboth learning paradigms share the same insight that the shared structure\nbetween existing training tasks could lead to better generalization and\nadaptation. In this paper, we take one important step further to understand the\nclose connection between these two learning paradigms, through both theoretical\nanalysis and empirical investigation. Theoretically, we first demonstrate that\nMTL shares the same optimization formulation with a class of gradient-based\nmeta-learning (GBML) algorithms. We then prove that for over-parameterized\nneural networks with sufficient depth, the learned predictive functions of MTL\nand GBML are close. In particular, this result implies that the predictions\ngiven by these two models are similar over the same unseen task. Empirically,\nwe corroborate our theoretical findings by showing that, with proper\nimplementation, MTL is competitive against state-of-the-art GBML algorithms on\na set of few-shot image classification benchmarks. Since existing GBML\nalgorithms often involve costly second-order bi-level optimization, our\nfirst-order MTL method is an order of magnitude faster on large-scale datasets\nsuch as mini-ImageNet. We believe this work could help bridge the gap between\nthese two learning paradigms, and provide a computationally efficient\nalternative to GBML that also supports fast task adaptation.",

          "description": "Recent development of Deep Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated superior\nperformance of neural networks in solving challenging problems with large or\neven continuous state spaces. One specific approach is to deploy neural\nnetworks to approximate value functions by minimising the Mean Squared Bellman\nError function. Despite great successes of Deep Reinforcement Learning,\ndevelopment of reliable and efficient numerical algorithms to minimise the\nBellman Error is still of great scientific interest and practical demand. Such\na challenge is partially due to the underlying optimisation problem being\nhighly non-convex or using incorrect gradient information as done in\nSemi-Gradient algorithms. In this work, we analyse the Mean Squared Bellman\nError from a smooth optimisation perspective combined with a Residual Gradient\nformulation. Our contribution is two-fold.\n\nFirst, we analyse critical points of the error function and provide technical\ninsights on the optimisation procure and design choices for neural networks.\nWhen the existence of global minima is assumed and the objective fulfils\ncertain conditions we can eliminate suboptimal local minima when using\nover-parametrised neural networks. We can construct an efficient Approximate\nNewton's algorithm based on our analysis and confirm theoretical properties of\nthis algorithm such as being locally quadratically convergent to a global\nminimum numerically.\n\nSecond, we demonstrate feasibility and generalisation capabilities of the\nproposed algorithm empirically using continuous control problems and provide a\nnumerical verification of our critical point analysis. We outline the short\ncoming of Semi-Gradients. To benefit from an approximate Newton's algorithm\ncomplete derivatives of the Mean Squared Bellman error must be considered\nduring training.",

In this paper, we\nstudy the problem of graph data augmentation for Graph Convolutional Network\n(GCN) in the context of improving the node embeddings for semi-supervised node\nclassification. Specifically, we conduct cosine similarity based cross\noperation on the original features to create new graph features, including new\nnode attributes and new graph topologies, and we combine them as new pairwise\ninputs for specific GCNs. Then, we propose an attentional integrating model to\nweighted sum the hidden node embeddings encoded by these GCNs into the final\nnode embeddings. We also conduct a disparity constraint on these hidden node\nembeddings when training to ensure that non-redundant information is captured\nfrom different features.

We further propose MIDAS-F, to solve the problem by\nwhich anomalies are incorporated into the algorithm's internal states, creating\na `poisoning' effect that can allow future anomalies to slip through\nundetected.

          "description": "Deep generative models such as GANs have driven impressive advances in\nconditional image synthesis in recent years. A persistent challenge has been to\ngenerate diverse versions of output images from the same input image, due to\nthe problem of mode collapse: because only one ground truth output image is\ngiven per input image, only one mode of the conditional distribution is\nmodelled. In this paper, we focus on this problem of multimodal conditional\nimage synthesis and build on the recently proposed technique of Implicit\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE). Prior IMLE-based methods required\ndifferent architectures for different tasks, which limit their applicability,\nand were lacking in fine details in the generated images. We propose CAM-Net, a\nunified architecture that can be applied to a broad range of tasks.\nAdditionally, it is capable of generating convincing high frequency details,\nachieving a reduction of the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by up to 45.3%\ncompared to the baseline.",

          "description": "Much work has been done recently to make neural networks more interpretable,\nand one obvious approach is to arrange for the network to use only a subset of\nthe available features. In linear models, Lasso (or $\\ell_1$-regularized)\nregression assigns zero weights to the most irrelevant or redundant features,\nand is widely used in data science. However the Lasso only applies to linear\nmodels. Here we introduce LassoNet, a neural network framework with global\nfeature selection. Our approach enforces a hierarchy: specifically a feature\ncan participate in a hidden unit only if its linear representative is active.\nUnlike other approaches to feature selection for neural nets, our method uses a\nmodified objective function with constraints, and so integrates feature\nselection with the parameter learning directly. As a result, it delivers an\nentire regularization path of solutions with a range of feature sparsity. On\nsystematic experiments, LassoNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods for feature selection and regression. The LassoNet method uses\nprojected proximal gradient descent, and generalizes directly to deep networks.\nIt can be implemented by adding just a few lines of code to a standard neural\nnetwork.",

Towards formally\nexplaining such structures of the Hessian, we show that the new eigenspace\nstructure can be explained by approximating the Hessian using Kronecker\nfactorization; we also prove the low rank structure for random data at random\ninitialization for over-parametrized two-layer neural nets.

          "description": "Variational autoencoders have been widely applied for natural language\ngeneration, however, there are two long-standing problems: information\nunder-representation and posterior collapse. The former arises from the fact\nthat only the last hidden state from the encoder is transformed to the latent\nspace, which is insufficient to summarize data. The latter comes as a result of\nthe imbalanced scale between the reconstruction loss and the KL divergence in\nthe objective function. To tackle these issues, in this paper we propose the\ndiscrete variational attention model with categorical distribution over the\nattention mechanism owing to the discrete nature in languages. Our approach is\ncombined with an auto-regressive prior to capture the sequential dependency\nfrom observations, which can enhance the latent space for language generation.\nMoreover, thanks to the property of discreteness, the training of our proposed\napproach does not suffer from posterior collapse. Furthermore, we carefully\nanalyze the superiority of discrete latent space over the continuous space with\nthe common Gaussian distribution.

          "description": "This paper proposes a Lasso-type estimator for a high-dimensional sparse\nparameter identified by a single index conditional moment restriction (CMR). In\naddition to this parameter, the moment function can also depend on a nuisance\nfunction, such as the propensity score or the conditional choice probability,\nwhich we estimate by modern machine learning tools. We first adjust the moment\nfunction so that the gradient of the future loss function is insensitive\n(formally, Neyman-orthogonal) with respect to the first-stage regularization\nbias, preserving the single index property. We then take the loss function to\nbe an indefinite integral of the adjusted moment function with respect to the\nsingle index. The proposed Lasso estimator converges at the oracle rate, where\nthe oracle knows the nuisance function and solves only the parametric problem.\nWe demonstrate our method by estimating the short-term heterogeneous impact of\nConnecticut's Jobs First welfare reform experiment on women's welfare\nparticipation decision.",

          "description": "We introduce a novel perspective on Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL);\nwhereas existing approaches infer a posterior over the transition distribution\nor Q-function, we characterise the uncertainty in the Bellman operator. Our\nBayesian Bellman operator (BBO) framework is motivated by the insight that when\nbootstrapping is introduced, model-free approaches actually infer a posterior\nover Bellman operators, not value functions. In this paper, we use BBO to\nprovide a rigorous theoretical analysis of model-free Bayesian RL to better\nunderstand its relationshipto established frequentist RL methodologies. We\nprove that Bayesian solutions are consistent with frequentist RL solutions,\neven when approximate inference isused, and derive conditions for which\nconvergence properties hold. Empirically, we demonstrate that algorithms\nderived from the BBO framework have sophisticated deep exploration properties\nthat enable them to solve continuous control tasks at which state-of-the-art\nregularised actor-critic algorithms fail catastrophically",

          "description": "We analyze (stochastic) gradient descent (SGD) with delayed updates on smooth\nquasi-convex and non-convex functions and derive concise, non-asymptotic,\nconvergence rates. We show that the rate of convergence in all cases consists\nof two terms: (i) a stochastic term which is not affected by the delay, and\n(ii) a higher order deterministic term which is only linearly slowed down by\nthe delay. Thus, in the presence of noise, the effects of the delay become\nnegligible after a few iterations and the algorithm converges at the same\noptimal rate as standard SGD. This result extends a line of research that\nshowed similar results in the asymptotic regime or for strongly-convex\nquadratic functions only. We further show similar results for SGD with more\nintricate form of delayed gradients---compressed gradients under error\ncompensation and for local~SGD where multiple workers perform local steps\nbefore communicating with each other. In all of these settings, we improve upon\nthe best known rates. These results show that SGD is robust to compressed\nand/or delayed stochastic gradient updates.

We propose a novel definition of this direction as the\ndirection of the vector pointing toward the closest point of the support of the\nclosest inaccurate class in decision space. To evaluate the alignment with this\ndirection after adversarial training, we apply a metric that uses generative\nadversarial networks to produce the smallest residual needed to change the\nclass present in the image.

Here, we prove rigorously that, indeed,\nthe Bayes-optimal prediction and inference of randomly but continuously\ntransforming environments, a common natural setting, relies on short-term\nspike-timing-dependent plasticity, a hallmark of biological synapses. Further,\nthis dynamic Bayesian inference through plasticity enables circuits of the\ncerebral cortex in simulations to recognize previously unseen, highly distorted\ndynamic stimuli. Strikingly, this also introduces a biologically-modelled AI,\nthe first to overcome multiple limitations of deep learning and outperform\nartificial neural networks in a visual task.

Such systems may\nbehave chaotically under certain conditions, and so the ability to detect chaos\nbased on empirical measurement is an important step in characterizing and\npredicting these processes. Classifying a system as chaotic usually requires\nestimating its largest Lyapunov exponent, which quantifies the average rate of\nconvergence or divergence of initially close trajectories in state space, and\nfor which a positive value is generally accepted as an operational definition\nof chaos. Estimating the largest Lyapunov exponent from observations of a\nprocess is especially challenging in systems affected by dynamical noise, which\nis the case for many models of real-world processes, in particular models of\nbiological systems. We describe a novel method for estimating the largest\nLyapunov exponent from data, based on training Deep Learning models on\nsynthetically generated trajectories, and demonstrate that this method yields\naccurate and noise-robust predictions given relatively short inputs and across\na range of different dynamical systems. Our method is unique in that it can\nanalyze tree-shaped data, a ubiquitous topology in biological settings, and\nspecifically in dynamics over lineages of cells or organisms. We also\ncharacterize the types of input information extracted by our models for their\npredictions, allowing for a deeper understanding into the different ways by\nwhich chaos can be analyzed in different topologies.",

          "description": "Training sparse networks to converge to the same performance as dense neural\narchitectures has proven to be elusive. Recent work suggests that\ninitialization is the key. However, while this direction of research has had\nsome success, focusing on initialization alone appears to be inadequate. In\nthis paper, we take a broader view of training sparse networks and consider the\nrole of regularization, optimization, and architecture choices on sparse\nmodels. We propose a simple experimental framework, Same Capacity Sparse vs\nDense Comparison (SC-SDC), that allows for a fair comparison of sparse and\ndense networks. Furthermore, we propose a new measure of gradient flow,\nEffective Gradient Flow (EGF), that better correlates to performance in sparse\nnetworks. Using top-line metrics, SC-SDC and EGF, we show that default choices\nof optimizers, activation functions and regularizers used for dense networks\ncan disadvantage sparse networks. Based upon these findings, we show that\ngradient flow in sparse networks can be improved by reconsidering aspects of\nthe architecture design and the training regime. Our work suggests that\ninitialization is only one piece of the puzzle and taking a wider view of\ntailoring optimization to sparse networks yields promising results.",

Often,\nabsolute distance measurements are often unreliable or simply unavailable and\nonly proxies to absolute distances in the form of similarities are available.\nHence we ask the following: Given only \\emph{comparisons} of similarities\namongst a set of entities, what can be said about the geometry of the\nunderlying space form? To study this question, we introduce the notions of the\n\\textit{ordinal capacity} of a target space form and \\emph{ordinal spread} of\nthe similarity measurements. The latter is an indicator of complex patterns in\nthe measurements, while the former quantifies the capacity of a space form to\naccommodate a set of measurements with a specific ordinal spread profile. We\nprove that the ordinal capacity of a space form is related to its dimension and\nthe sign of its curvature. This leads to a lower bound on the Euclidean and\nspherical embedding dimension of what we term similarity graphs. More\nimportantly, we show that the statistical behavior of the ordinal spread random\nvariables defined on a similarity graph can be used to identify its underlying\nspace form. We support our theoretical claims with experiments on weighted\ntrees, single-cell RNA expression data and spherical cartographic measurements.",

          "description": "Weak supervision has shown promising results in many natural language\nprocessing tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). Existing work mainly\nfocuses on learning deep NER models only with weak supervision, i.e., without\nany human annotation, and shows that by merely using weakly labeled data, one\ncan achieve good performance, though still underperforms fully supervised NER\nwith manually/strongly labeled data. In this paper, we consider a more\npractical scenario, where we have both a small amount of strongly labeled data\nand a large amount of weakly labeled data. Unfortunately, we observe that\nweakly labeled data does not necessarily improve, or even deteriorate the model\nperformance (due to the extensive noise in the weak labels) when we train deep\nNER models over a simple or weighted combination of the strongly labeled and\nweakly labeled data. To address this issue, we propose a new multi-stage\ncomputational framework -- NEEDLE with three essential ingredients: (1) weak\nlabel completion, (2) noise-aware loss function, and (3) final fine-tuning over\nthe strongly labeled data. Through experiments on E-commerce query NER and\nBiomedical NER, we demonstrate that NEEDLE can effectively suppress the noise\nof the weak labels and outperforms existing methods. In particular, we achieve\nnew SOTA F1-scores on 3 Biomedical NER datasets: BC5CDR-chem 93.74,\nBC5CDR-disease 90.69, NCBI-disease 92.28.",

However, the exact tradeoff between fairness and accuracy with a\nreal-valued target is not clear. In this paper, we characterize the inherent\ntradeoff between statistical parity and accuracy in the regression setting by\nproviding a lower bound on the error of any fair regressor. Our lower bound is\nsharp, algorithm-independent, and admits a simple interpretation: when the\nmoments of the target differ between groups, any fair algorithm has to make a\nlarge error on at least one of the groups. We further extend this result to\ngive a lower bound on the joint error of any (approximately) fair algorithm,\nusing the Wasserstein distance to measure the quality of the approximation. On\nthe upside, we establish the first connection between individual fairness,\naccuracy parity, and the Wasserstein distance by showing that if a regressor is\nindividually fair, it also approximately verifies the accuracy parity, where\nthe gap is given by the Wasserstein distance between the two groups. Inspired\nby our theoretical results, we develop a practical algorithm for fair\nregression through the lens of representation learning, and conduct experiments\non a real-world dataset to corroborate our findings.",

          "description": "The simultaneous rise of machine learning as a service and concerns over user\nprivacy have increasingly motivated the need for private inference (PI). While\nrecent work demonstrates PI is possible using cryptographic primitives, the\ncomputational overheads render it impractical. The community is largely\nunprepared to address these overheads, as the source of slowdown in PI stems\nfrom the ReLU operator whereas optimizations for plaintext inference focus on\noptimizing FLOPs. In this paper we re-think the ReLU computation and propose\noptimizations for PI tailored to properties of neural networks. Specifically,\nwe reformulate ReLU as an approximate sign test and introduce a novel\ntruncation method for the sign test that significantly reduces the cost per\nReLU. These optimizations result in a specific type of stochastic ReLU. The key\nobservation is that the stochastic fault behavior is well suited for the\nfault-tolerant properties of neural network inference. Thus, we provide\nsignificant savings without impacting accuracy. We collectively call the\noptimizations Circa and demonstrate improvements of up to 4.7x storage and 3x\nruntime over baseline implementations; we further show that Circa can be used\non top of recent PI optimizations to obtain 1.8x additional speedup.",

Previous works\non memory mechanisms show benefits of using episodic-based data structures for\ndiscrete action problems in terms of sample-efficiency. The application of\nepisodic memory for continuous control with a large action space is not\ntrivial. Our study aims to answer the question: can episodic memory be used to\nimprove agent's performance in continuous control? Our proposed algorithm\ncombines episodic memory with Actor-Critic architecture by modifying critic's\nobjective. We further improve performance by introducing episodic-based replay\nbuffer prioritization. We evaluate our algorithm on OpenAI gym domains and show\ngreater sample-efficiency compared with the state-of-the art model-free\noff-policy algorithms.",

          "description": "In this paper, we present a novel method to constrain invexity on Neural\nNetworks (NN). Invex functions ensure every stationary point is global minima.\nHence, gradient descent commenced from any point will lead to the global\nminima. Another advantage of invexity on NN is to divide data space locally\ninto two connected sets with a highly non-linear decision boundary by simply\nthresholding the output. To this end, we formulate a universal invex function\napproximator and employ it to enforce invexity in NN. We call it Input Invex\nNeural Networks (II-NN). We first fit data with a known invex function,\nfollowed by modification with a NN, compare the direction of the gradient and\npenalize the direction of gradient on NN if it contradicts with the direction\nof reference invex function. In order to penalize the direction of the gradient\nwe perform Gradient Clipped Gradient Penalty (GC-GP). We applied our method to\nthe existing NNs for both image classification and regression tasks. From the\nextensive empirical and qualitative experiments, we observe that our method\ngives the performance similar to ordinary NN yet having invexity. Our method\noutperforms linear NN and Input Convex Neural Network (ICNN) with a large\nmargin. We publish our code and implementation details at github.",

In large dimension,\nthe probability of reaching a reward vanishes and the agent receives little\nlearning signal. Methods such as Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) tackle this\nissue by also learning from realized but unplanned-for goals. But HER is known\nto introduce bias, and can converge to low-return policies by overestimating\nchancy outcomes. First, we vindicate HER by proving that it is actually\nunbiased in deterministic environments, such as many optimal control settings.\nNext, for stochastic environments in continuous spaces, we tackle sparse\nrewards by directly taking the infinitely sparse reward limit. We fully\nformalize the problem of multi-goal RL with infinitely sparse Dirac rewards at\neach goal.

In order to avoid training two separate models, we show that it is\npossible to train neural networks in such a way that a predefined 'core'\nsubnetwork can be split-off from the trained full network with remarkable good\nperformance. We extend on prior methods that focused only on core networks of\nsmaller width, while we focus on supporting arbitrary core network\narchitectures. Our proposed training scheme switches consecutively between\noptimizing only the core part of the network and the full one. The accuracy of\nthe full model remains comparable, while the core network achieves better\nperformance than when it is trained in isolation.

Two major components of prosody are pitch\nand rhythm. Disentangling the prosody information, particularly the rhythm\ncomponent, from the speech is challenging because it involves breaking the\nsynchrony between the input speech and the disentangled speech representation.\nAs a result, most existing prosody style transfer algorithms would need to rely\non some form of text transcriptions to identify the content information, which\nconfines their application to high-resource languages only. Recently,\nSpeechSplit has made sizeable progress towards unsupervised prosody style\ntransfer, but it is unable to extract high-level global prosody style in an\nunsupervised manner. In this paper, we propose AutoPST, which can disentangle\nglobal prosody style from speech without relying on any text transcriptions.\nAutoPST is an Autoencoder-based Prosody Style Transfer framework with a\nthorough rhythm removal module guided by the self-expressive representation\nlearning.

          "description": "Language is an interface to the outside world. In order for embodied agents\nto use it, language must be grounded in other, sensorimotor modalities. While\nthere is an extended literature studying how machines can learn grounded\nlanguage, the topic of how to learn spatio-temporal linguistic concepts is\nstill largely uncharted. To make progress in this direction, we here introduce\na novel spatio-temporal language grounding task where the goal is to learn the\nmeaning of spatio-temporal descriptions of behavioral traces of an embodied\nagent. This is achieved by training a truth function that predicts if a\ndescription matches a given history of observations. The descriptions involve\ntime-extended predicates in past and present tense as well as spatio-temporal\nreferences to objects in the scene. To study the role of architectural biases\nin this task, we train several models including multimodal Transformer\narchitectures; the latter implement different attention computations between\nwords and objects across space and time. We test models on two classes of\ngeneralization: 1) generalization to randomly held-out sentences; 2)\ngeneralization to grammar primitives. We observe that maintaining object\nidentity in the attention computation of our Transformers is instrumental to\nachieving good performance on generalization overall, and that summarizing\nobject traces in a single token has little influence on performance. We then\ndiscuss how this opens new perspectives for language-guided autonomous embodied\nagents. We also release our code under open-source license as well as\npretrained models and datasets to encourage the wider community to build upon\nand extend our work in the future.",

          "description": "Predicting the future motion of multiple agents is necessary for planning in\ndynamic environments. This task is challenging for autonomous driving since\nagents (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians) and their associated behaviors may be\ndiverse and influence each other. Most prior work has focused on first\npredicting independent futures for each agent based on all past motion, and\nthen planning against these independent predictions. However, planning against\nfixed predictions can suffer from the inability to represent the future\ninteraction possibilities between different agents, leading to sub-optimal\nplanning. In this work, we formulate a model for predicting the behavior of all\nagents jointly in real-world driving environments in a unified manner. Inspired\nby recent language modeling approaches, we use a masking strategy as the query\nto our model, enabling one to invoke a single model to predict agent behavior\nin many ways, such as potentially conditioned on the goal or full future\ntrajectory of the autonomous vehicle or the behavior of other agents in the\nenvironment. Our model architecture fuses heterogeneous world state in a\nunified Transformer architecture by employing attention across road elements,\nagent interactions and time steps. We evaluate our approach on autonomous\ndriving datasets for behavior prediction, and achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance. Our work demonstrates that formulating the problem of behavior\nprediction in a unified architecture with a masking strategy may allow us to\nhave a single model that can perform multiple motion prediction and planning\nrelated tasks effectively.",

Integration of BSR\noperations enables the TVM runtime execution to leverage structured pattern\nsparsity induced by model regularization.\n\nThis integrated view of pruning algorithms enables us to study relationships\nbetween modeling decisions and their direct impact on sparsity-enhanced\nexecution. Our main findings are: 1) we validate that performance benefits of\nstructured sparsity block regularization must be enabled by the BSR\naugmentations to TVM, with 4x speedup relative to vanilla PyTorch and 2.2x\nspeedup relative to standard TVM compilation (without expanded BSR support). 2)\nfor BERT attention weights, the end-to-end optimal block sparsity shape in this\nCPU inference context is not a square block (as in \\cite{gray2017gpu}) but\nrather a linear 32x1 block 3) the relationship between performance and block\nsize / shape is is suggestive of how model regularization parameters interact\nwith task scheduler optimizations resulting in the observed end-to-end\nperformance.",

          "description": "The planning of attractive and cost efficient public transport systems is a\nhighly complex optimization process involving many steps. Integrating\nrobustness from a passenger's point of view makes the task even more\nchallenging. With numerous different definitions of robustness in literature, a\nreal-world acceptable evaluation of the robustness of a public transport system\nis to simulate its performance under a large number of possible scenarios.\nUnfortunately, this is computationally very expensive. In this paper, we\ntherefore explore a new way of such a scenario-based robustness approximation\nby using methods from machine learning. We achieve a fast approach with a very\nhigh accuracy by gathering a subset of key features of a public transport\nsystem and its passenger demand and training an artificial neural network to\nlearn the outcome of a given set of robustness tests. The network is then able\nto predict the robustness of untrained instances with high accuracy using only\nits key features, allowing for a robustness oracle for transport planners that\napproximates the robustness in constant time. Such an oracle can be used as\nblack box to increase the robustness within a local search framework for\nintegrated public transportation planning. In computational experiments with\ndifferent benchmark instances we demonstrate an excellent quality of our\npredictions.",

          "description": "Reinforcement learning is made much more complex when the agent's observation\nis partial or noisy. This case corresponds to a partially observable Markov\ndecision process (POMDP). One strategy to seek good performance in POMDPs is to\nendow the agent with a finite memory, whose update is governed by the policy.\nHowever, policy optimization is non-convex in that case and can lead to poor\ntraining performance for random initialization. The performance can be\nempirically improved by constraining the memory architecture, then sacrificing\noptimality to facilitate training. Here we study this trade-off in the two-arm\nbandit problem, and compare two extreme cases: (i) the random access memory\nwhere any transitions between $M$ memory states are allowed and (ii) a fixed\nmemory where the agent can access its last $m$ actions and rewards. For (i),\nthe probability $q$ to play the worst arm is known to be exponentially small in\n$M$ for the optimal policy. Our main result is to show that similar performance\ncan be reached for (ii) as well, despite the simplicity of the memory\narchitecture: using a conjecture on Gray-ordered binary necklaces, we find\npolicies for which $q$ is exponentially small in $2^m$ i.e. $q\\sim\\alpha^{2^m}$\nfor some $\\alpha < 1$. Interestingly, we observe empirically that training from\nrandom initialization leads to very poor results for (i), and significantly\nbetter results for (ii).",

The latter is a long-standing\nproblem during the training of VAEs as the optimization is trapped to a\ndisastrous local optimum. In this paper, we propose Discrete Auto-regressive\nVariational Attention Model (DAVAM) to address the challenges.

Using heuristic methods from physics, we find in the\nridgeless case that locality is key in determining the learning curve exponent\n$\\beta$ (that relates the test error $\\epsilon_t\\sim P^{-\\beta}$ to the size of\nthe training set $P$), whereas translational invariance is not. In particular,\nif the filter size of the teacher $t$ is smaller than that of the student $s$,\n$\\beta$ is a function of $s$ only and does not depend on the input dimension.\nWe confirm our predictions on $\\beta$ empirically. Theoretically, in some cases\n(including when teacher and student are equal) it can be shown that this\nprediction is an upper bound on performance.

          "description": "The training of deep learning models poses vast challenges of including\nparameter tuning and ordering of training data. Significant research has been\ndone in Curriculum learning for optimizing the sequence of training data.\nRecent works have focused on using complex reinforcement learning techniques to\nfind the optimal data ordering strategy to maximize learning for a given\nnetwork. In this paper, we present a simple and efficient technique based on\ncontinuous optimization. We call this new approach Training Sequence\nOptimization (TSO). There are three critical components in our proposed\napproach: (a) An encoder network maps/embeds training sequence into continuous\nspace. (b) A predictor network uses the continuous representation of a strategy\nas input and predicts the accuracy for fixed network architecture. (c) A\ndecoder further maps a continuous representation of a strategy to the ordered\ntraining dataset. The performance predictor and encoder enable us to perform\ngradient-based optimization in the continuous space to find the embedding of\noptimal training data ordering with potentially better accuracy. Experiments\nshow that we can gain 2AP with our generated optimal curriculum strategy over\nthe random strategy using the CIFAR-100 dataset and have better boosts than the\nstate of the art CL algorithms. We do an ablation study varying the\narchitecture, dataset and sample sizes showcasing our approach's robustness.",

          "description": "A variety of dimensionality reduction techniques have been applied for\ncomputations involving large matrices. The underlying matrix is randomly\ncompressed into a smaller one, while approximately retaining many of its\noriginal properties. As a result, much of the expensive computation can be\nperformed on the small matrix. The sketching of positive semidefinite (PSD)\nmatrices is well understood, but there are many applications where the related\nmatrices are not PSD, including Hessian matrices in non-convex optimization and\ncovariance matrices in regression applications involving complex numbers. In\nthis paper, we present novel dimensionality reduction methods for non-PSD\nmatrices, as well as their ``square-roots\", which involve matrices with complex\nentries. We show how these techniques can be used for multiple downstream\ntasks. In particular, we show how to use the proposed matrix sketching\ntechniques for both convex and non-convex optimization, $\\ell_p$-regression for\nevery $1 \\leq p \\leq \\infty$, and vector-matrix-vector queries.",

Instead of directly comparing the weights, activations, or outputs\nof two models, we compare their behavioral patterns on the same set of test\ninputs. Specifically, the behavioral pattern of a model is represented as a\ndecision distance vector (DDV), in which each element is the distance between\nthe model's reactions to a pair of inputs. The knowledge similarity between two\nmodels is measured with the cosine similarity between their DDVs. To evaluate\nModelDiff, we created a benchmark that contains 144 pairs of models that cover\nmost popular model reuse methods, including transfer learning, model\ncompression, and model stealing. Our method achieved 91.7% correctness on the\nbenchmark, which demonstrates the effectiveness of using ModelDiff for model\nreuse detection.

We provide\nevidence that demonstrates that learning of features in the synthetic domain by\na stereo matching network is heavily influenced by two \"shortcuts\" presented in\nthe synthetic data: (1) identical local statistics (RGB colour features)\nbetween matching pixels in the synthetic stereo images and (2) lack of realism\nin synthetic textures on 3D objects simulated in game engines.

While traditionally thought of as an aspect of over-training, recent\nwork suggests that the memorization risk manifests especially strongly when the\ntraining datasets are noisy and memorization is the only recourse.\nUnfortunately, most code intelligence tasks rely on rather noise-prone and\nrepetitive data sources, such as GitHub, which, due to their sheer size, cannot\nbe manually inspected and evaluated. We evaluate the memorization and\ngeneralization tendencies in neural code intelligence models through a case\nstudy across several benchmarks and model families by leveraging established\napproaches from other fields that use DNNs, such as introducing targeted noise\ninto the training dataset.

Vanilla NAS\nevaluates each architecture by training from scratch, which gives the true\nperformance but is extremely time-consuming.

However, the performance estimation can be\nvery inaccurate due to the co-adaption among operations. In this paper, we\npropose few-shot NAS that uses multiple supernetworks, called sub-supernet,\neach covering different regions of the search space to alleviate the undesired\nco-adaption. Compared to one-shot NAS, few-shot NAS improves the accuracy of\narchitecture evaluation with a small increase of evaluation cost. With only up\nto 7 sub-supernets, few-shot NAS establishes new SoTAs: on ImageNet, it finds\nmodels that reach 80.5% top-1 accuracy at 600 MB FLOPS and 77.5% top-1 accuracy\nat 238 MFLOPS; on CIFAR10, it reaches 98.72% top-1 accuracy without using extra\ndata or transfer learning.

Few studies have tackled this\nchallenging problem from a machine learning point-of-view due to a shortage of\nhigh-resolution datasets with many historical observations globally. In this\npaper, we present a novel satellite-based dataset called ``CloudCast''. It\nconsists of 70,080 images with 10 different cloud types for multiple layers of\nthe atmosphere annotated on a pixel level. The spatial resolution of the\ndataset is 928 x 1530 pixels (3x3 km per pixel) with 15-min intervals between\nframes for the period 2017-01-01 to 2018-12-31. All frames are centered and\nprojected over Europe. To supplement the dataset, we conduct an evaluation\nstudy with current state-of-the-art video prediction methods such as\nconvolutional long short-term memory networks, generative adversarial networks,\nand optical flow-based extrapolation methods. As the evaluation of video\nprediction is difficult in practice, we aim for a thorough evaluation in the\nspatial and temporal domain. Our benchmark models show promising results but\nwith ample room for improvement. This is the first publicly available\nglobal-scale dataset with high-resolution cloud types on a high temporal\ngranularity to the authors' best knowledge.",

          "description": "In design, fabrication, and control problems, we are often faced with the\ntask of synthesis, in which we must generate an object or configuration that\nsatisfies a set of constraints while maximizing one or more objective\nfunctions. The synthesis problem is typically characterized by a physical\nprocess in which many different realizations may achieve the goal. This\nmany-to-one map presents challenges to the supervised learning of feed-forward\nsynthesis, as the set of viable designs may have a complex structure. In\naddition, the non-differentiable nature of many physical simulations prevents\ndirect optimization. We address both of these problems with a two-stage neural\nnetwork architecture that we may consider to be an autoencoder. We first learn\nthe decoder: a differentiable surrogate that approximates the many-to-one\nphysical realization process. We then learn the encoder, which maps from goal\nto design, while using the fixed decoder to evaluate the quality of the\nrealization. We evaluate the approach on two case studies: extruder path\nplanning in additive manufacturing and constrained soft robot inverse\nkinematics. We compare our approach to direct optimization of design using the\nlearned surrogate, and to supervised learning of the synthesis problem. We find\nthat our approach produces higher quality solutions than supervised learning,\nwhile being competitive in quality with direct optimization, at a greatly\nreduced computational cost.",

          "description": "Tabular data are ubiquitous for the widespread applications of tables and\nhence have attracted the attention of researchers to extract underlying\ninformation. One of the critical problems in mining tabular data is how to\nunderstand their inherent semantic structures automatically. Existing studies\ntypically adopt Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to model the spatial\ninformation of tabular structures yet ignore more diverse relational\ninformation between cells, such as the hierarchical and paratactic\nrelationships. To simultaneously extract spatial and relational information\nfrom tables, we propose a novel neural network architecture, TabularNet. The\nspatial encoder of TabularNet utilizes the row/column-level Pooling and the\nBidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) to capture statistical information\nand local positional correlation, respectively. For relational information, we\ndesign a new graph construction method based on the WordNet tree and adopt a\nGraph Convolutional Network (GCN) based encoder that focuses on the\nhierarchical and paratactic relationships between cells. Our neural network\narchitecture can be a unified neural backbone for different understanding tasks\nand utilized in a multitask scenario. We conduct extensive experiments on three\nclassification tasks with two real-world spreadsheet data sets, and the results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TabularNet over state-of-the-art\nbaselines.",

          "description": "We consider the problem of minimizing regret in an $N$ agent heterogeneous\nstochastic linear bandits framework, where the agents (users) are similar but\nnot all identical. We model user heterogeneity using two popularly used ideas\nin practice; (i) A clustering framework where users are partitioned into groups\nwith users in the same group being identical to each other, but different\nacross groups, and (ii) a personalization framework where no two users are\nnecessarily identical, but a user's parameters are close to that of the\npopulation average. In the clustered users' setup, we propose a novel\nalgorithm, based on successive refinement of cluster identities and regret\nminimization. We show that, for any agent, the regret scales as\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T/N})$, if the agent is in a `well separated' cluster, or\nscales as $\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\frac{1}{2} + \\varepsilon}/(N)^{\\frac{1}{2}\n-\\varepsilon})$ if its cluster is not well separated, where $\\varepsilon$ is\npositive and arbitrarily close to $0$. Our algorithm is adaptive to the cluster\nseparation, and is parameter free -- it does not need to know the number of\nclusters, separation and cluster size, yet the regret guarantee adapts to the\ninherent complexity. In the personalization framework, we introduce a natural\nalgorithm where, the personal bandit instances are initialized with the\nestimates of the global average model. We show that, an agent $i$ whose\nparameter deviates from the population average by $\\epsilon_i$, attains a\nregret scaling of $\\widetilde{O}(\\epsilon_i\\sqrt{T})$. This demonstrates that\nif the user representations are close (small $\\epsilon_i)$, the resulting\nregret is low, and vice-versa. The results are empirically validated and we\nobserve superior performance of our adaptive algorithms over non-adaptive\nbaselines.",

In this paper, we investigate the global structure of\nattention scores computed using this dot product mechanism on a typical\ndistribution of inputs, and study the principal components of their variation.\nThrough eigen analysis of full attention score matrices, as well as of their\nindividual rows, we find that most of the variation among attention scores lie\nin a low-dimensional eigenspace. Moreover, we find significant overlap between\nthese eigenspaces for different layers and even different transformer models.\nBased on this, we propose to compute scores only for a partial subset of token\npairs, and use them to estimate scores for the remaining pairs. Beyond\ninvestigating the accuracy of reconstructing attention scores themselves, we\ninvestigate training transformer models that employ these approximations, and\nanalyze the effect on overall accuracy.

          "description": "A driver's gaze is critical for determining their attention, state,\nsituational awareness, and readiness to take over control from partially\nautomated vehicles. Estimating the gaze direction is the most obvious way to\ngauge a driver's state under ideal conditions when limited to using\nnon-intrusive imaging sensors. Unfortunately, the vehicular environment\nintroduces a variety of challenges that are usually unaccounted for - harsh\nillumination, nighttime conditions, and reflective eyeglasses. Relying on head\npose alone under such conditions can prove to be unreliable and erroneous. In\nthis study, we offer solutions to address these problems encountered in the\nreal world. To solve issues with lighting, we demonstrate that using an\ninfrared camera with suitable equalization and normalization suffices. To\nhandle eyeglasses and their corresponding artifacts, we adopt image-to-image\ntranslation using generative adversarial networks to pre-process images prior\nto gaze estimation. Our proposed Gaze Preserving CycleGAN (GPCycleGAN) is\ntrained to preserve the driver's gaze while removing potential eyeglasses from\nface images. GPCycleGAN is based on the well-known CycleGAN approach - with the\naddition of a gaze classifier and a gaze consistency loss for additional\nsupervision.

While improving the\ndifferent components of these systems has been the focus of numerous studies,\nestimating the impact of such improvements on the revenue has been overlooked\nin the literature despite its practical importance. Indeed, quantifying the\nbenefit of a change in a system serves as support for investment decisions.\nThis is a challenging problem as it corresponds to the difference between the\ngenerated value and the value that would have been generated keeping the system\nas before. The latter is not observable. Moreover, the expected impact can be\nsmall in relative value. In this paper, we cast the problem as counterfactual\nprediction of unobserved revenue. The impact on revenue is then the difference\nbetween the observed and the estimated revenue. The originality of this work\nlies in the innovative application of econometric methods proposed for\nmacroeconomic applications to a new problem setting. Broadly applicable, the\napproach benefits from only requiring revenue data observed for\norigin-destination pairs in the network of the airline at each day, before and\nafter a change in the system is applied. We report results using real\nlarge-scale data from Air Canada. We compare a deep neural network\ncounterfactual predictions model with econometric models.

This one-step algorithm beats the previously reported\nresults of iterative algorithms on a large portion of the D4RL benchmark. The\nsimple one-step baseline achieves this strong performance without many of the\ntricks used by previously proposed iterative algorithms and is more robust to\nhyperparameters.

Separate DL models were trained on 70\\% of the processed data for\n\"Local\" protocols as well as 93 American College of Radiology (\"ACR\") protocols\nand 48 \"General\" protocols. The DL Models were assessed in an \"auto-protocoling\n(AP)\" inference mode which returns the top recommendation and in a \"clinical\ndecision support (CDS)\" inference mode which returns up to 10 protocols for\nradiologist review. The accuracy of each protocol recommendation was computed\nand analyzed based on the difference between the normalized output score of the\ncorresponding neural net for the top two recommendations.\n\nResults: The top predicted protocol in AP mode was correct for 82.8%, 73.8%,\nand 69.3% of the test cases for \"General\", \"ACR\", and \"Local\" protocol classes,\nrespectively. Higher levels of accuracy over 96% were obtained for all protocol\nclasses in CDS mode. However, at current validation performance levels, the\nproposed models offer modest, positive, financial impact on large-scale imaging\nnetworks.\n\nConclusions: DL-based protocol automation is feasible and can be tuned to\nroute substantial fractions of exams for auto-protocoling, with higher accuracy\nwith more general protocols. Economic analyses of the tested algorithms\nindicate that improved algorithm performance is required to yield a practical\nexam auto-protocoling tool for sub-specialized imaging exams.",

At the same time,\nshrinking profit margins in the energy markets let wind farm managers explore\noptions for cost reductions in the turbine operation and maintenance.\nSensor-based condition monitoring facilitates remote diagnostics of turbine\nsubsystems, enabling faster responses when unforeseen maintenance is required.\nCondition monitoring with data from the turbines' supervisory control and data\nacquisition (SCADA) systems was proposed and SCADA-based fault detection and\ndiagnosis approaches introduced based on single-task normal operation models of\nturbine state variables. As the number of SCADA channels has grown strongly,\nthousands of independent single-target models are in place today for monitoring\na single turbine. Multi-target learning was recently proposed to limit the\nnumber of models. This study applied multi-target neural networks to the task\nof early fault detection in drive-train components. The accuracy and delay of\ndetecting gear bearing faults were compared to state-of-the-art single-target\napproaches. We found that multi-target multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) detected\nfaults at least as early and in many cases earlier than single-target MLPs. The\nmulti-target MLPs could detect faults up to several days earlier than the\nsingle-target models. This can deliver a significant advantage in the planning\nand performance of maintenance work. At the same time, the multi-target MLPs\nachieved the same level of prediction stability.",

Since insurance is required for registering a car, obtaining a\nmortgage, and participating in certain businesses, it is especially important\nthat the models which price insurance policies are fair and non-discriminatory.\nBlack box models can make it very difficult to know which covariates are\ninfluencing the results. SHAP values enable interpretation of various black box\nmodels, but little progress has been made in two-part models. In this paper, we\npropose mSHAP (or multiplicative SHAP), a method for computing SHAP values of\ntwo-part models using the SHAP values of the individual models. This method\nwill allow for the predictions of two-part models to be explained at an\nindividual observation level. After developing mSHAP, we perform an in-depth\nsimulation study. Although the kernelSHAP algorithm is also capable of\ncomputing approximate SHAP values for a two-part model, a comparison with our\nmethod demonstrates that mSHAP is exponentially faster. Ultimately, we apply\nmSHAP to a two-part ratemaking model for personal auto property damage\ninsurance coverage.

This paper\nproposes PatchMix, a data augmentation method that creates new samples by\ncomposing patches from pairs of images in a grid-like pattern. These new\nsamples' ground truth labels are set as proportional to the number of patches\nfrom each image. We then add a set of additional losses at the patch-level to\nregularize and to encourage good representations at both the patch and image\nlevels. A ResNet-50 model trained on ImageNet using PatchMix exhibits superior\ntransfer learning capabilities across a wide array of benchmarks. Although\nPatchMix can rely on random pairings and random grid-like patterns for mixing,\nwe explore evolutionary search as a guiding strategy to discover optimal\ngrid-like patterns and image pairing jointly. For this purpose, we conceive a\nfitness function that bypasses the need to re-train a model to evaluate each\nchoice. In this way, PatchMix outperforms a base model on CIFAR-10 (+1.91),\nCIFAR-100 (+5.31), Tiny Imagenet (+3.52), and ImageNet (+1.16) by significant\nmargins, also outperforming previous state-of-the-art pairwise augmentation\nstrategies.",

In a market-driven context, current approaches\nto collect and analyze users feedback are based on techniques leveraging\ninformation extracted from product reviews and social media. These approaches\nare hardly applicable in bespoke software development, or in contexts in which\none needs to gather information from specific users. In such cases, companies\nneed to resort to face-to-face interviews to get feedback on their products. In\nthis paper, we propose to utilize biometric data, in terms of physiological and\nvoice features, to complement interviews with information about the engagement\nof the user on the discussed product-relevant topics. We evaluate our approach\nby interviewing users while gathering their physiological data (i.e.,\nbiofeedback) using an Empatica E4 wristband, and capturing their voice through\nthe default audio-recorder of a common laptop. Our results show that we can\npredict users' engagement by training supervised machine learning algorithms on\nbiometric data, and that voice features alone can be sufficiently effective.\nThe performance of the prediction algorithms is maximised when pre-processing\nthe training data with the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE).\nThe results of our work suggest that biofeedback and voice analysis can be used\nto facilitate prioritization of requirements oriented to product improvement,\nand to steer the interview based on users' engagement.

While there is a rich literature on VC, most proposed\nmethods are trained and evaluated on clean speech recordings. However, many\nacoustic environments are noisy and reverberant, severely restricting the\napplicability of popular VC methods to such scenarios. To address this\nlimitation, we propose Voicy, a new VC framework particularly tailored for\nnoisy speech. Our method, which is inspired by the de-noising auto-encoders\nframework, is comprised of four encoders (speaker, content, phonetic and\nacoustic-ASR) and one decoder. Importantly, Voicy is capable of performing\nnon-parallel zero-shot VC, an important requirement for any VC system that\nneeds to work on speakers not seen during training. We have validated our\napproach using a noisy reverberant version of the LibriSpeech dataset.\nExperimental results show that Voicy outperforms other tested VC techniques in\nterms of naturalness and target speaker similarity in noisy reverberant\nenvironments.",

The best-known previous result on $\\ell_2$ estimation error for\nthis problem is $O\\left( \\frac{s\\log\\left( {d}/{s}\\right)}{n2^b}\\right)$.\nSurprisingly, we show that when sample size $n$ exceeds a minimum threshold\n$n^*(s, d, b)$, we can achieve an $\\ell_2$ estimation error of $O\\left(\n\\frac{s}{n2^b}\\right)$. This implies that when $n>n^*(s, d, b)$ the convergence\nrate does not depend on the ambient dimension $d$ and is the same as knowing\nthe support of the distribution beforehand.\n\nWe next ask the question: ``what is the minimum $n^*(s, d, b)$ that allows\ndimension-free convergence?''. To upper bound $n^*(s, d, b)$, we develop novel\nlocalization schemes to accurately and efficiently localize the unknown\nsupport. For the non-interactive setting, we show that $n^*(s, d, b) = O\\left(\n\\min \\left( {d^2\\log^2 d}/{2^b}, {s^4\\log^2 d}/{2^b}\\right) \\right)$.

We label a system state to\nbe stable if it's immediate past and future states reside in the same regime.\nHowever, at a given time step we don't have the prior knowledge about whether\nsystem is in stable or unstable region. In this paper, we develop and train a\nfeed forward (multi-layer perceptron) Neural Network to classify the system\nstates of a Lorenz system as stable and unstable. We pose this task as a\nsupervised learning problem where we train the neural network on Lorenz system\nwhich have states labeled as stable or unstable. We then test the ability of\nthe neural network models to identify the stable and unstable states on a\ndifferent Lorenz system that is generated using different initial conditions.\nWe also evaluate the classification performance in the mismatched case i.e.,\nwhen the initial conditions for training and validation data are sampled from\ndifferent intervals. We show that certain normalization schemes can greatly\nimprove the performance of neural networks in especially these mismatched\nscenarios. The classification framework developed in the paper can be a\npreprocessor for a larger context of sequential decision making framework where\nthe decision making is performed based on observed stable or unstable states.",

          "description": "Online learning with expert advice is widely used in various machine learning\ntasks. It considers the problem where a learner chooses one from a set of\nexperts to take advice and make a decision. In many learning problems, experts\nmay be related, henceforth the learner can observe the losses associated with a\nsubset of experts that are related to the chosen one. In this context, the\nrelationship among experts can be captured by a feedback graph, which can be\nused to assist the learner's decision making. However, in practice, the nominal\nfeedback graph often entails uncertainties, which renders it impossible to\nreveal the actual relationship among experts. To cope with this challenge, the\npresent work studies various cases of potential uncertainties, and develops\nnovel online learning algorithms to deal with uncertainties while making use of\nthe uncertain feedback graph. The proposed algorithms are proved to enjoy\nsublinear regret under mild conditions. Experiments on real datasets are\npresented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel algorithms.",

The most efficient models use deep-learning\narchitectures similar to those in the NLP community, posing a challenge due to\ntheir tremendous number of parameters and limited robustness. In particular,\ndeep-learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks: a little change in\nthe input harms the model's output.\n\nIn this work, we examine adversarial attacks on transaction records data and\ndefences from these attacks. The transaction records data have a different\nstructure than the canonical NLP or time series data, as neighbouring records\nare less connected than words in sentences, and each record consists of both\ndiscrete merchant code and continuous transaction amount. We consider a\nblack-box attack scenario, where the attack doesn't know the true decision\nmodel, and pay special attention to adding transaction tokens to the end of a\nsequence. These limitations provide more realistic scenario, previously\nunexplored in NLP world.\n\nThe proposed adversarial attacks and the respective defences demonstrate\nremarkable performance using relevant datasets from the financial industry. Our\nresults show that a couple of generated transactions are sufficient to fool a\ndeep-learning model. Further, we improve model robustness via adversarial\ntraining or separate adversarial examples detection. This work shows that\nembedding protection from adversarial attacks improves model robustness,\nallowing a wider adoption of deep models for transaction records in banking and\nfinance.",

          "description": "In the last few years, deep learning classifiers have shown promising results\nin image-based medical diagnosis. However, interpreting the outputs of these\nmodels remains a challenge. In cancer diagnosis, interpretability can be\nachieved by localizing the region of the input image responsible for the\noutput, i.e. the location of a lesion. Alternatively, segmentation or detection\nmodels can be trained with pixel-wise annotations indicating the locations of\nmalignant lesions. Unfortunately, acquiring such labels is labor-intensive and\nrequires medical expertise. To overcome this difficulty, weakly-supervised\nlocalization can be utilized. These methods allow neural network classifiers to\noutput saliency maps highlighting the regions of the input most relevant to the\nclassification task (e.g. malignant lesions in mammograms) using only\nimage-level labels (e.g. whether the patient has cancer or not) during\ntraining. When applied to high-resolution images, existing methods produce\nlow-resolution saliency maps. This is problematic in applications in which\nsuspicious lesions are small in relation to the image size. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel neural network architecture to perform weakly-supervised\nsegmentation of high-resolution images. The proposed model selects regions of\ninterest via coarse-level localization, and then performs fine-grained\nsegmentation of those regions. We apply this model to breast cancer diagnosis\nwith screening mammography, and validate it on a large clinically-realistic\ndataset. Measured by Dice similarity score, our approach outperforms existing\nmethods by a large margin in terms of localization performance of benign and\nmalignant lesions, relatively improving the performance by 39.6% and 20.0%,\nrespectively.

          "description": "The use of machine learning to guide clinical decision making has the\npotential to worsen existing health disparities. Several recent works frame the\nproblem as that of algorithmic fairness, a framework that has attracted\nconsiderable attention and criticism. However, the appropriateness of this\nframework is unclear due to both ethical as well as technical considerations,\nthe latter of which include trade-offs between measures of fairness and model\nperformance that are not well-understood for predictive models of clinical\noutcomes. To inform the ongoing debate, we conduct an empirical study to\ncharacterize the impact of penalizing group fairness violations on an array of\nmeasures of model performance and group fairness. We repeat the analyses across\nmultiple observational healthcare databases, clinical outcomes, and sensitive\nattributes. We find that procedures that penalize differences between the\ndistributions of predictions across groups induce nearly-universal degradation\nof multiple performance metrics within groups. On examining the secondary\nimpact of these procedures, we observe heterogeneity of the effect of these\nprocedures on measures of fairness in calibration and ranking across\nexperimental conditions. Beyond the reported trade-offs, we emphasize that\nanalyses of algorithmic fairness in healthcare lack the contextual grounding\nand causal awareness necessary to reason about the mechanisms that lead to\nhealth disparities, as well as about the potential of algorithmic fairness\nmethods to counteract those mechanisms. In light of these limitations, we\nencourage researchers building predictive models for clinical use to step\noutside the algorithmic fairness frame and engage critically with the broader\nsociotechnical context surrounding the use of machine learning in healthcare.",

          "description": "In structured prediction, a major challenge for models is to represent the\ninterdependencies within their output structures. For the common case where\noutputs are structured as a sequence, linear-chain conditional random fields\n(CRFs) are a widely used model class which can learn local dependencies in\noutput sequences. However, the CRF's Markov assumption makes it impossible for\nthese models to capture nonlocal dependencies, and standard CRFs are unable to\nrespect nonlocal constraints of the data (such as global arity constraints on\noutput labels). We present a generalization of CRFs that can enforce a broad\nclass of constraints, including nonlocal ones, by specifying the space of\npossible output structures as a regular language $\\mathcal{L}$. The resulting\nregular-constrained CRF (RegCCRF) has the same formal properties as a standard\nCRF, but assigns zero probability to all label sequences not in $\\mathcal{L}$.\nNotably, RegCCRFs can incorporate their constraints during training, while\nrelated models only enforce constraints during decoding. We prove that\nconstrained training is never worse than constrained decoding, and show using\nsynthetic data that it can be substantially better in practice. Additionally,\nwe demonstrate a practical benefit on downstream tasks by incorporating a\nRegCCRF into a deep neural model for semantic role labeling, exceeding\nstate-of-the-art results on a standard dataset.",

          "description": "Predicting the motion of agents such as pedestrians or human-driven vehicles\nis one of the most critical problems in the autonomous driving domain. The\noverall safety of driving and the comfort of a passenger directly depend on its\nsuccessful solution. The motion prediction problem also remains one of the most\nchallenging problems in autonomous driving engineering, mainly due to high\nvariance of the possible agent's future behavior given a situation. The two\nphenomena responsible for the said variance are the multimodality caused by the\nuncertainty of the agent's intent (e.g., turn right or move forward) and\nuncertainty in the realization of a given intent (e.g., which lane to turn\ninto). To be useful within a real-time autonomous driving pipeline, a motion\nprediction system must provide efficient ways to describe and quantify this\nuncertainty, such as computing posterior modes and their probabilities or\nestimating density at the point corresponding to a given trajectory. It also\nshould not put substantial density on physically impossible trajectories, as\nthey can confuse the system processing the predictions. In this paper, we\nintroduce the PRANK method, which satisfies these requirements. PRANK takes\nrasterized bird-eye images of agent's surroundings as an input and extracts\nfeatures of the scene with a convolutional neural network. It then produces the\nconditional distribution of agent's trajectories plausible in the given scene.\nThe key contribution of PRANK is a way to represent that distribution using\nnearest-neighbor methods in latent trajectory space, which allows for efficient\ninference in real time. We evaluate PRANK on the in-house and Argoverse\ndatasets, where it shows competitive results.",

          "description": "Modern online advertising systems inevitably rely on personalization methods,\nsuch as click-through rate (CTR) prediction. Recent progress in CTR prediction\nenjoys the rich representation capabilities of deep learning and achieves great\nsuccess in large-scale industrial applications. However, these methods can\nsuffer from lack of exploration. Another line of prior work addresses the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off problem with contextual bandit methods,\nwhich are recently less studied in the industry due to the difficulty in\nextending their flexibility with deep models. In this paper, we propose a novel\nDeep Uncertainty-Aware Learning (DUAL) method to learn CTR models based on\nGaussian processes, which can provide predictive uncertainty estimations while\nmaintaining the flexibility of deep neural networks. DUAL can be easily\nimplemented on existing models and deployed in real-time systems with minimal\nextra computational overhead. By linking the predictive uncertainty estimation\nability of DUAL to well-known bandit algorithms, we further present DUAL-based\nAd-ranking strategies to boost up long-term utilities such as the social\nwelfare in advertising systems. Experimental results on several public datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Remarkably, an online A/B test\ndeployed in the Alibaba display advertising platform shows an 8.2% social\nwelfare improvement and an 8.0% revenue lift.",

          "description": "Program synthesis has emerged as a successful approach to the image parsing\ntask. Most prior works rely on a two-step scheme involving supervised\npretraining of a Seq2Seq model with synthetic programs followed by\nreinforcement learning (RL) for fine-tuning with real reference images. Fully\nunsupervised approaches promise to train the model directly on the target\nimages without requiring curated pretraining datasets. However, they struggle\nwith the inherent sparsity of meaningful programs in the search space. In this\npaper, we present the first unsupervised algorithm capable of parsing\nconstructive solid geometry (CSG) images into context-free grammar (CFG)\nwithout pretraining via non-differentiable renderer. To tackle the\n\\emph{non-Markovian} sparse reward problem, we combine three key ingredients --\n(i) a grammar-encoded tree LSTM ensuring program validity (ii) entropy\nregularization and (iii) sampling without replacement from the CFG syntax tree.\nEmpirically, our algorithm recovers meaningful programs in large search spaces\n(up to $3.8 \\times 10^{28}$). Further, even though our approach is fully\nunsupervised, it generalizes better than supervised methods on the synthetic 2D\nCSG dataset.

          "description": "Adversarial robustness of deep neural networks is an extensively studied\nproblem in the literature and various methods have been proposed to defend\nagainst adversarial images. However, only a handful of defense methods have\nbeen developed for defending against attacked videos. In this paper, we propose\na novel Over-and-Under complete restoration network for Defending against\nadversarial videos (OUDefend). Most restoration networks adopt an\nencoder-decoder architecture that first shrinks spatial dimension then expands\nit back. This approach learns undercomplete representations, which have large\nreceptive fields to collect global information but overlooks local details. On\nthe other hand, overcomplete representations have opposite properties. Hence,\nOUDefend is designed to balance local and global features by learning those two\nrepresentations. We attach OUDefend to target video recognition models as a\nfeature restoration block and train the entire network end-to-end. Experimental\nresults show that the defenses focusing on images may be ineffective to videos,\nwhile OUDefend enhances robustness against different types of adversarial\nvideos, ranging from additive attacks, multiplicative attacks to physically\nrealizable attacks.

Recent studies\nabout adversarial robustness focus on the loss landscape in the parameter space\nsince it is related to optimization and generalization performance. These\nstudies conclude that the difficulty of adversarial training is caused by the\nnon-smoothness of the loss function: i.e., its gradient is not Lipschitz\ncontinuous. However, this analysis ignores the dependence of adversarial\nattacks on model parameters. Since adversarial attacks are optimized for\nmodels, they should depend on the parameters. Considering this dependence, we\nanalyze the smoothness of the loss function of adversarial training using the\noptimal attacks for the model parameter in more detail. We reveal that the\nconstraint of adversarial attacks is one cause of the non-smoothness and that\nthe smoothness depends on the types of the constraints. Specifically, the\n$L_\\infty$ constraint can cause non-smoothness more than the $L_2$ constraint.\nMoreover, our analysis implies that if we flatten the loss function with\nrespect to input data, the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of adversarial\nloss tends to increase. To address the non-smoothness, we show that EntropySGD\nsmoothens the non-smooth loss and improves the performance of adversarial\ntraining.",

While graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successful in\nencoding graph structures, existing GNN-based methods for community detection\nare limited by requiring knowledge of the number of communities in advance, in\naddition to lacking a proper probabilistic formulation to handle uncertainty.\nWe propose a simple framework for amortized community detection, which\naddresses both of these issues by combining the expressive power of GNNs with\nrecent methods for amortized clustering. Our models consist of a graph\nrepresentation backbone that extracts structural information and an amortized\nclustering network that naturally handles variable numbers of clusters. Both\ncomponents combine into well-defined models of the posterior distribution of\ngraph communities and are jointly optimized given labeled graphs.

          "description": "In the context of DP-SGD each round communicates a local SGD update which\nleaks some new information about the underlying local data set to the outside\nworld. In order to provide privacy, Gaussian noise is added to local SGD\nupdates. However, privacy leakage still aggregates over multiple training\nrounds. Therefore, in order to control privacy leakage over an increasing\nnumber of training rounds, we need to increase the added Gaussian noise per\nlocal SGD update. This dependence of the amount of Gaussian noise $\\sigma$ on\nthe number of training rounds $T$ may impose an impractical upper bound on $T$\n(because $\\sigma$ cannot be too large) leading to a low accuracy global model\n(because the global model receives too few local SGD updates). DP-SGD much less\ncompetitive compared to other existing privacy techniques.\n\nWe show for the first time that for $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy\n$\\sigma$ can be chosen equal to $\\sqrt{2(\\epsilon +\\ln(1/\\delta))/\\epsilon}$\nregardless the total number of training rounds $T$. In other words, $\\sigma$\ndoes not depend on $T$ anymore (and aggregation of privacy leakage increases to\na limit). This important discovery brings DP-SGD to practice because $\\sigma$\ncan remain small to make the trained model have high accuracy even for large\n$T$ as usually happens in practice.",

          "description": "Stochastic gradient MCMC methods, such as stochastic gradient Langevin\ndynamics (SGLD), employ fast but noisy gradient estimates to enable large-scale\nposterior sampling. Although we can easily extend SGLD to distributed settings,\nit suffers from two issues when applied to federated non-IID data. First, the\nvariance of these estimates increases significantly. Second, delaying\ncommunication causes the Markov chains to diverge from the true posterior even\nfor very simple models. To alleviate both these problems, we propose conducive\ngradients, a simple mechanism that combines local likelihood approximations to\ncorrect gradient updates. Notably, conducive gradients are easy to compute, and\nsince we only calculate the approximations once, they incur negligible\noverhead. We apply conducive gradients to distributed stochastic gradient\nLangevin dynamics (DSGLD) and call the resulting method federated stochastic\ngradient Langevin dynamics (FSGLD). We demonstrate that our approach can handle\ndelayed communication rounds, converging to the target posterior in cases where\nDSGLD fails.

          "description": "Low-rank matrix estimation is a canonical problem that finds numerous\napplications in signal processing, machine learning and imaging science. A\npopular approach in practice is to factorize the matrix into two compact\nlow-rank factors, and then optimize these factors directly via simple iterative\nmethods such as gradient descent and alternating minimization. Despite\nnonconvexity, recent literatures have shown that these simple heuristics in\nfact achieve linear convergence when initialized properly for a growing number\nof problems of interest. However, upon closer examination, existing approaches\ncan still be computationally expensive especially for ill-conditioned matrices:\nthe convergence rate of gradient descent depends linearly on the condition\nnumber of the low-rank matrix, while the per-iteration cost of alternating\nminimization is often prohibitive for large matrices. The goal of this paper is\nto set forth a competitive algorithmic approach dubbed Scaled Gradient Descent\n(ScaledGD) which can be viewed as pre-conditioned or diagonally-scaled gradient\ndescent, where the pre-conditioners are adaptive and iteration-varying with a\nminimal computational overhead. With tailored variants for low-rank matrix\nsensing, robust principal component analysis and matrix completion, we\ntheoretically show that ScaledGD achieves the best of both worlds: it converges\nlinearly at a rate independent of the condition number of the low-rank matrix\nsimilar as alternating minimization, while maintaining the low per-iteration\ncost of gradient descent. Our analysis is also applicable to general loss\nfunctions that are restricted strongly convex and smooth over low-rank\nmatrices. To the best of our knowledge, ScaledGD is the first algorithm that\nprovably has such properties over a wide range of low-rank matrix estimation\ntasks.",

          "description": "Many meta-learning methods are proposed for few-shot detection. However,\nprevious most methods have two main problems, poor detection APs, and strong\nbias because of imbalance and insufficient datasets. Previous works mainly\nalleviate these issues by additional datasets, multi-relation attention\nmechanisms and sub-modules. However, they require more cost. In this work, for\nmeta-learning, we find that the main challenges focus on related or irrelevant\nsemantic features between categories. Therefore, based on semantic features, we\npropose a Top-C classification loss (i.e., TCL-C) for classification task and a\ncategory-based grouping mechanism for category-based meta-features obtained by\nthe meta-model. The TCL-C exploits the true-label prediction and the most\nlikely C-1 false classification predictions to improve detection performance on\nfew-shot classes. According to similar appearance (i.e., visual appearance,\nshape, and limbs etc.) and environment in which objects often appear, the\ncategory-based grouping mechanism splits categories into disjoint groups to\nmake similar semantic features more compact between categories within a group\nand obtain more significant difference between groups, alleviating the strong\nbias problem and further improving detection APs. The whole training consists\nof the base model and the fine-tuning phases.

After training, the learnt models alone are adapted\nonto testing features to predict testing labels in isolation, with training\ndata wasted and their associations ignored. To take full advantage of the vast\nnumber of training data and their associations, we propose a novel learning\nparadigm called Memory-Associated Differential (MAD) Learning. We first\nintroduce an additional component called Memory to memorize all the training\ndata. Then we learn the differences of labels as well as the associations of\nfeatures in the combination of a differential equation and some sampling\nmethods. Finally, in the evaluating phase, we predict unknown labels by\ninferencing from the memorized facts plus the learnt differences and\nassociations in a geometrically meaningful manner.

The corresponding\noptimization problem is combinatorial, but we propose a novel relaxation of it\nas an \\emph{invex} optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first invex relaxation for a combinatorial problem.

As an endeavor in this direction,\nsubstantial recent research efforts have been focused on teaching machines \"how\nto paint\", in a manner similar to a human painter. However, the applicability\nof previous methods has been limited to datasets with little variation in\nposition, scale and saliency of the foreground object. As a consequence, we\nfind that these methods struggle to cover the granularity and diversity\npossessed by real world images. To this end, we propose a Semantic Guidance\npipeline with 1) a bi-level painting procedure for learning the distinction\nbetween foreground and background brush strokes at training time. 2) We also\nintroduce invariance to the position and scale of the foreground object through\na neural alignment model, which combines object localization and spatial\ntransformer networks in an end to end manner, to zoom into a particular\nsemantic instance. 3) The distinguishing features of the in-focus object are\nthen amplified by maximizing a novel guided backpropagation based focus reward.\nThe proposed agent does not require any supervision on human stroke-data and\nsuccessfully handles variations in foreground object attributes, thus,\nproducing much higher quality canvases for the CUB-200 Birds and Stanford\nCars-196 datasets. Finally, we demonstrate the further efficacy of our method\non complex datasets with multiple foreground object instances by evaluating an\nextension of our method on the challenging Virtual-KITTI dataset.

They also showed that any relative-error\nlow-rank approximation algorithm must query $\\Omega(nk/\\epsilon)$ entries of\n$A$, this gap has since remained open. Our main result is to resolve this\nquestion by obtaining an optimal algorithm that queries $O(nk/\\epsilon)$\nentries of $A$ and outputs a relative-error low-rank approximation in\n$O(n(k/\\epsilon)^{\\omega-1})$ time. Note, our running time improves that of\nMusco and Woodruff, and matches the information-theoretic lower bound if the\nmatrix-multiplication exponent $\\omega$ is $2$.\n\nWe then extend our techniques to negative-type distance matrices. Bakshi and\nWoodruff (NeurIPS, 2018) showed a bi-criteria, relative-error low-rank\napproximation which queries $O(nk/\\epsilon^{2.5})$ entries and outputs a\nrank-$(k+4)$ matrix. We show that the bi-criteria guarantee is not necessary\nand obtain an $O(nk/\\epsilon)$ query algorithm, which is optimal. Our algorithm\napplies to all distance matrices that arise from metrics satisfying\nnegative-type inequalities, including $\\ell_1, \\ell_2,$ spherical metrics and\nhypermetrics.\n\nNext, we introduce a new robust low-rank approximation model which captures\nPSD matrices that have been corrupted with noise. While a sample complexity\nlower bound precludes sublinear algorithms for arbitrary PSD matrices, we\nprovide the first sublinear time and query algorithms when the corruption on\nthe diagonal entries is bounded. As a special case, we show sample-optimal\nsublinear time algorithms for low-rank approximation of correlation matrices\ncorrupted by noise.",

However,\nML models, considered as core intellectual properties of model owners, are now\nstored on billions of untrusted devices and subject to potential thefts. Leaked\nmodels can cause both severe financial loss and security consequences. This\npaper presents the first empirical study of ML model protection on mobile\ndevices. Our study aims to answer three open questions with quantitative\nevidence: How widely is model protection used in apps? How robust are existing\nmodel protection techniques? What impacts can (stolen) models incur? To that\nend, we built a simple app analysis pipeline and analyzed 46,753 popular apps\ncollected from the US and Chinese app markets. We identified 1,468 ML apps\nspanning all popular app categories. We found that, alarmingly, 41% of ML apps\ndo not protect their models at all, which can be trivially stolen from app\npackages. Even for those apps that use model protection or encryption, we were\nable to extract the models from 66% of them via unsophisticated dynamic\nanalysis techniques. The extracted models are mostly commercial products and\nused for face recognition, liveness detection, ID/bank card recognition, and\nmalware detection.

In this U-shaped network, a paired sampling operation is proposed in\nspacetime domain accordingly: the pooling (ST-Pool) coarsens the input graph in\nspatial from its deterministic partition while abstracts multi-resolution\ntemporal dependencies through dilated recurrent skip connections; based on\nprevious settings in the downsampling, the unpooling (ST-Unpool) restores the\noriginal structure of spatio-temporal graphs and resumes regular intervals\nwithin graph sequences.

          "description": "We propose using an adversarial autoencoder (AAE) to replace generative\nadversarial network (GAN) in the private aggregation of teacher ensembles\n(PATE), a solution for ensuring differential privacy in speech applications.\nThe AAE architecture allows us to obtain good synthetic speech leveraging upon\na discriminative training of latent vectors. Such synthetic speech is used to\nbuild a privacy-preserving classifier when non-sensitive data is not\nsufficiently available in the public domain. This classifier follows the PATE\nscheme that uses an ensemble of noisy outputs to label the synthetic samples\nand guarantee $\\varepsilon$-differential privacy (DP) on its derived\nclassifiers. Our proposed framework thus consists of an AAE-based generator and\na PATE-based classifier (PATE-AAE). Evaluated on the Google Speech Commands\nDataset Version II, the proposed PATE-AAE improves the average classification\naccuracy by +$2.11\\%$ and +$6.60\\%$, respectively, when compared with\nalternative privacy-preserving solutions, namely PATE-GAN and DP-GAN, while\nmaintaining a strong level of privacy target at $\\varepsilon$=0.01 with a fixed\n$\\delta$=10$^{-5}$.",

          "description": "We study the transfer learning process between two linear regression\nproblems. An important and timely special case is when the regressors are\noverparameterized and perfectly interpolate their training data. We examine a\nparameter transfer mechanism whereby a subset of the parameters of the target\ntask solution are constrained to the values learned for a related source task.\nWe analytically characterize the generalization error of the target task in\nterms of the salient factors in the transfer learning architecture, i.e., the\nnumber of examples available, the number of (free) parameters in each of the\ntasks, the number of parameters transferred from the source to target task, and\nthe correlation between the two tasks. Our non-asymptotic analysis shows that\nthe generalization error of the target task follows a two-dimensional double\ndescent trend (with respect to the number of free parameters in each of the\ntasks) that is controlled by the transfer learning factors. Our analysis points\nto specific cases where the transfer of parameters is beneficial. Specifically,\nwe show that transferring a specific set of parameters that generalizes well on\nthe respective part of the source task can soften the demand on the task\ncorrelation level that is required for successful transfer learning. Moreover,\nwe show that the usefulness of a transfer learning setting is fragile and\ndepends on a delicate interplay among the set of transferred parameters, the\nrelation between the tasks, and the true solution.",

Despite recent interest in machine agents that reason\nabout other agents, it is not clear if such agents learn or hold the core\npsychology principles that drive human reasoning. Inspired by cognitive\ndevelopment studies on intuitive psychology, we present a benchmark consisting\nof a large dataset of procedurally generated 3D animations, AGENT (Action,\nGoal, Efficiency, coNstraint, uTility), structured around four scenarios (goal\npreferences, action efficiency, unobserved constraints, and cost-reward\ntrade-offs) that probe key concepts of core intuitive psychology. We validate\nAGENT with human-ratings, propose an evaluation protocol emphasizing\ngeneralization, and compare two strong baselines built on Bayesian inverse\nplanning and a Theory of Mind neural network. Our results suggest that to pass\nthe designed tests of core intuitive psychology at human levels, a model must\nacquire or have built-in representations of how agents plan, combining utility\ncomputations and core knowledge of objects and physics.",

We\nderive a computationally efficient implementation of this JKO-ICNN framework\nand use various experiments to demonstrate its feasibility and validity in\napproximating solutions of low-dimensional partial differential equations with\nknown solutions.

To at least partially\naddress these issues within a simple transparent framework, we consider a new\nfamily of GNN layers designed to mimic and integrate the update rules of two\nclassical iterative algorithms, namely, proximal gradient descent and iterative\nreweighted least squares (IRLS). The former defines an extensible base GNN\narchitecture that is immune to oversmoothing while nonetheless capturing\nlong-range dependencies by allowing arbitrary propagation steps. In contrast,\nthe latter produces a novel attention mechanism that is explicitly anchored to\nan underlying end-to-end energy function, contributing stability with respect\nto edge uncertainty. When combined we obtain an extremely simple yet robust\nmodel that we evaluate across disparate scenarios including standardized\nbenchmarks, adversarially-perturbated graphs, graphs with heterophily, and\ngraphs involving long-range dependencies.

Firstly, we design two simple MNISTbased SDG benchmarks, namely\nMNIST Color SDG-MP and MNIST Color SDG-UP, which highlight the two different\nfundamental SDG issues of increasing difficulties: 1) a class-correlated\npattern in the training domain is missing (SDG-MP), or 2) uncorrelated with the\nclass (SDG-UP), in the testing data domain. This is in sharp contrast with the\ncurrent domain generalization (DG) benchmarks which mix up different\ncorrelation and variation factors and thereby make hard to disentangle success\nor failure factors when benchmarking DG algorithms. We further evaluate several\nstate-of-the-art SDG algorithms through our simple benchmark, namely MNIST\nColor SDG-MP, and show that the issue SDG-MP is largely unsolved despite of a\ndecade of efforts in developing DG algorithms.

          "description": "Many modern systems for speaker diarization, such as the recently-developed\nVBx approach, rely on clustering of DNN speaker embeddings followed by\nresegmentation. Two problems with this approach are that the DNN is not\ndirectly optimized for this task, and the parameters need significant retuning\nfor different applications. We have recently presented progress in this\ndirection with a Leave-One-Out Gaussian PLDA (LGP) clustering algorithm and an\napproach to training the DNN such that embeddings directly optimize performance\nof this scoring method. This paper presents a new two-pass version of this\nsystem, where the second pass uses finer time resolution to significantly\nimprove overall performance. For the Callhome corpus, we achieve the first\npublished error rate below 4% without any task-dependent parameter tuning.

We present novel strategies to enable precise\nyet efficient repair such as inferring correctness specifications to act as\noracles for intermediate layer repair, and generation of experts for each\nclass. We demonstrate the technique in the context of three different\nscenarios: (1) Improving the overall accuracy of a model, (2) Fixing security\nvulnerabilities caused by poisoning of training data and (3) Improving the\nrobustness of the network against adversarial attacks. Our evaluation on MNIST\nand CIFAR-10 models shows that NNrepair can improve the accuracy by 45.56\npercentage points on poisoned data and 10.40 percentage points on adversarial\ndata.

However, the constrained resources and limited local data\namount pose significant challenges to the development of edge AI. To overcome\nthese challenges, we explore continual edge learning capable of leveraging the\nknowledge transfer from previous tasks. Aiming to achieve fast and continual\nedge learning, we propose a platform-aided federated meta-learning architecture\nwhere edge nodes collaboratively learn a meta-model, aided by the knowledge\ntransfer from prior tasks. The edge learning problem is cast as a regularized\noptimization problem, where the valuable knowledge learned from previous tasks\nis extracted as regularization. Then, we devise an ADMM based federated\nmeta-learning algorithm, namely ADMM-FedMeta, where ADMM offers a natural\nmechanism to decompose the original problem into many subproblems which can be\nsolved in parallel across edge nodes and the platform. Further, a variant of\ninexact-ADMM method is employed where the subproblems are `solved' via linear\napproximation as well as Hessian estimation to reduce the computational cost\nper round to $\\mathcal{O}(n)$. We provide a comprehensive analysis of\nADMM-FedMeta, in terms of the convergence properties, the rapid adaptation\nperformance, and the forgetting effect of prior knowledge transfer, for the\ngeneral non-convex case.

The learning goal is to minimize the\nattackable rate (the probability mass of attackable test instances), which is\nmore difficult than optimal PAC learning. As we show, any robust algorithm with\ndiminishing attackable rate can achieve the optimal dependence on $\\epsilon$ in\nits PAC sample complexity, i.e., $O(1/\\epsilon)$.

In this experiment, a malicious actor\ntrains a surrogate model using the EMBER-2018 dataset to discover binary\nmutations that cause an instance to be misclassified via a Monte Carlo tree\nsearch. Then, mutated malware is sent to the victim model that takes the place\nof an antivirus API to test whether it can evade detection.",

          "description": "Many advances that have improved the robustness and efficiency of deep\nreinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can, in one way or another, be\nunderstood as introducing additional objectives, or constraints, in the policy\noptimization step. This includes ideas as far ranging as exploration bonuses,\nentropy regularization, and regularization toward teachers or data priors when\nlearning from experts or in offline RL. Often, task reward and auxiliary\nobjectives are in conflict with each other and it is therefore natural to treat\nthese examples as instances of multi-objective (MO) optimization problems. We\nstudy the principles underlying MORL and introduce a new algorithm,\nDistillation of a Mixture of Experts (DiME), that is intuitive and\nscale-invariant under some conditions. We highlight its strengths on standard\nMO benchmark problems and consider case studies in which we recast offline RL\nand learning from experts as MO problems. This leads to a natural algorithmic\nformulation that sheds light on the connection between existing approaches. For\noffline RL, we use the MO perspective to derive a simple algorithm, that\noptimizes for the standard RL objective plus a behavioral cloning term. This\noutperforms state-of-the-art on two established offline RL benchmarks.",

          "description": "In recent years the ubiquitous deployment of AI has posed great concerns in\nregards to algorithmic bias, discrimination, and fairness. Compared to\ntraditional forms of bias or discrimination caused by humans, algorithmic bias\ngenerated by AI is more abstract and unintuitive therefore more difficult to\nexplain and mitigate. A clear gap exists in the current literature on\nevaluating and mitigating bias in pruned neural networks. In this work, we\nstrive to tackle the challenging issues of evaluating, mitigating, and\nexplaining induced bias in pruned neural networks. Our paper makes three\ncontributions. First, we propose two simple yet effective metrics, Combined\nError Variance (CEV) and Symmetric Distance Error (SDE), to quantitatively\nevaluate the induced bias prevention quality of pruned models. Second, we\ndemonstrate that knowledge distillation can mitigate induced bias in pruned\nneural networks, even with unbalanced datasets. Third, we reveal that model\nsimilarity has strong correlations with pruning induced bias, which provides a\npowerful method to explain why bias occurs in pruned neural networks.

The model is based on iterative Optimal Transport of a series of 1D\nslices, matching on each slice the marginal PDF to the target. The axes of the\northogonal slices are chosen to maximize the PDF difference using Wasserstein\ndistance at each iteration, which enables the algorithm to scale well to high\ndimensions. As special cases of this algorithm, we introduce two sliced\niterative Normalizing Flow (SINF) models, which map from the data to the latent\nspace (GIS) and vice versa (SIG). We show that SIG is able to generate high\nquality samples of image datasets, which match the GAN benchmarks, while GIS\nobtains competitive results on density estimation tasks compared to the density\ntrained NFs, and is more stable, faster, and achieves higher $p(x)$ when\ntrained on small training sets.

This paradigm relies on direct supervision examples,\nwhich is not applicable to many applications, such as generating adversarial\nattacks or generating prompts to control language models. Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) on the other hand offers a more flexible solution by allowing\nusers to plug in arbitrary task metrics as reward. Yet previous RL algorithms\nfor text generation, such as policy gradient (on-policy RL) and Q-learning\n(off-policy RL), are often notoriously inefficient or unstable to train due to\nthe large sequence space and the sparse reward received only at the end of\nsequences. In this paper, we introduce a new RL formulation for text generation\nfrom the soft Q-learning perspective. It further enables us to draw from the\nlatest RL advances, such as path consistency learning, to combine the best of\non-/off-policy updates, and learn effectively from sparse reward. We apply the\napproach to a wide range of tasks, including learning from noisy/negative\nexamples, adversarial attacks, and prompt generation. Experiments show our\napproach consistently outperforms both task-specialized algorithms and the\nprevious RL methods. On standard supervised tasks where MLE prevails, our\napproach also achieves competitive performance and stability by training text\ngeneration from scratch.",

          "description": "Powered by machine learning services in the cloud, numerous learning-driven\nmobile applications are gaining popularity in the market. As deep learning\ntasks are mostly computation-intensive, it has become a trend to process raw\ndata on devices and send the deep neural network (DNN) features to the cloud,\nwhere the features are further processed to return final results. However,\nthere is always unexpected leakage with the release of features, with which an\nadversary could infer a significant amount of information about the original\ndata. We propose a privacy-preserving reinforcement learning framework on top\nof the mobile cloud infrastructure from the perspective of DNN structures. The\nframework aims to learn a policy to modify the base DNNs to prevent information\nleakage while maintaining high inference accuracy. The policy can also be\nreadily transferred to large-size DNNs to speed up learning. Extensive\nevaluations on a variety of DNNs have shown that our framework can successfully\nfind privacy-preserving DNN structures to defend different privacy attacks.",

          "description": "In deep learning with differential privacy (DP), the neural network achieves\nthe privacy usually at the cost of slower convergence (and thus lower\nperformance) than its non-private counterpart. This work gives the first\nconvergence analysis of the DP deep learning, through the lens of training\ndynamics and the neural tangent kernel (NTK). Our convergence theory\nsuccessfully characterizes the effects of two key components in the DP\ntraining: the per-sample clipping (flat or layerwise) and the noise addition.\nOur analysis not only initiates a general principled framework to understand\nthe DP deep learning with any network architecture and loss function, but also\nmotivates a new clipping method -- the global clipping, that significantly\nimproves the convergence while preserving the same privacy guarantee as the\nexisting local clipping.\n\nIn terms of theoretical results, we establish the precise connection between\nthe per-sample clipping and NTK matrix. We show that in the gradient flow,\ni.e., with infinitesimal learning rate, the noise level of DP optimizers does\nnot affect the convergence. We prove that DP gradient descent (GD) with global\nclipping guarantees the monotone convergence to zero loss, which can be\nviolated by the existing DP-GD with local clipping. Notably, our analysis\nframework easily extends to other optimizers, e.g., DP-Adam. Empirically\nspeaking, DP optimizers equipped with global clipping perform strongly on a\nwide range of classification and regression tasks. In particular, our global\nclipping is surprisingly effective at learning calibrated classifiers, in\ncontrast to the existing DP classifiers which are oftentimes over-confident and\nunreliable. Implementation-wise, the new clipping can be realized by adding one\nline of code into the Opacus library.",

          "description": "Recent studies have exposed that many graph neural networks (GNNs) are\nsensitive to adversarial attacks, and can suffer from performance loss if the\ngraph structure is intentionally perturbed. A different line of research has\nshown that many GNN architectures implicitly assume that the underlying graph\ndisplays homophily, i.e., connected nodes are more likely to have similar\nfeatures and class labels, and perform poorly if this assumption is not\nfulfilled. In this work, we formalize the relation between these two seemingly\ndifferent issues. We theoretically show that in the standard scenario in which\nnode features exhibit homophily, impactful structural attacks always lead to\nincreased levels of heterophily. Then, inspired by GNN architectures that\ntarget heterophily, we present two designs -- (i) separate aggregators for ego-\nand neighbor-embeddings, and (ii) a reduced scope of aggregation -- that can\nsignificantly improve the robustness of GNNs. Our extensive empirical\nevaluations show that GNNs featuring merely these two designs can achieve\nsignificantly improved robustness compared to the best-performing unvaccinated\nmodel with 24.99% gain in average performance under targeted attacks, while\nhaving smaller computational overhead than existing defense mechanisms.\nFurthermore, these designs can be readily combined with explicit defense\nmechanisms to yield state-of-the-art robustness with up to 18.33% increase in\nperformance under attacks compared to the best-performing vaccinated model.",

          "description": "Domain adaptation is an important problem and often needed for real-world\napplications. In this problem, instead of i.i.d. datapoints, we assume that the\nsource (training) data and the target (testing) data have different\ndistributions. With that setting, the empirical risk minimization training\nprocedure often does not perform well, since it does not account for the change\nin the distribution. A common approach in the domain adaptation literature is\nto learn a representation of the input that has the same distributions over the\nsource and the target domain. However, these approaches often require\nadditional networks and/or optimizing an adversarial (minimax) objective, which\ncan be very expensive or unstable in practice. To tackle this problem, we first\nderive a generalization bound for the target loss based on the training loss\nand the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the source and the\ntarget representation distributions. Based on this bound, we derive an\nalgorithm that minimizes the KL term to obtain a better generalization to the\ntarget domain. We show that with a probabilistic representation network, the KL\nterm can be estimated efficiently via minibatch samples without any additional\nnetwork or a minimax objective. This leads to a theoretically sound alignment\nmethod which is also very efficient and stable in practice.

          "description": "Deep neural network (DNN) generally takes thousands of iterations to optimize\nvia gradient descent and thus has a slow convergence. In addition, softmax, as\na decision layer, may ignore the distribution information of the data during\nclassification. Aiming to tackle the referred problems, we propose a novel\nmanifold neural network based on non-gradient optimization, i.e., the\nclosed-form solutions. Considering that the activation function is generally\ninvertible, we reconstruct the network via forward ridge regression and low\nrank backward approximation, which achieve the rapid convergence. Moreover, by\nunifying the flexible Stiefel manifold and adaptive support vector machine, we\ndevise the novel decision layer which efficiently fits the manifold structure\nof the data and label information. Consequently, a jointly non-gradient\noptimization method is designed to generate the network with closed-form\nresults.

Following\nBERT developed in the natural language processing area, we propose a masked\nimage modeling task to pretrain vision Transformers. Specifically, each image\nhas two views in our pre-training, i.e, image patches (such as 16x16 pixels),\nand visual tokens (i.e., discrete tokens). We first \"tokenize\" the original\nimage into visual tokens. Then we randomly mask some image patches and fed them\ninto the backbone Transformer. The pre-training objective is to recover the\noriginal visual tokens based on the corrupted image patches. After pre-training\nBEiT, we directly fine-tune the model parameters on downstream tasks by\nappending task layers upon the pretrained encoder. Experimental results on\nimage classification and semantic segmentation show that our model achieves\ncompetitive results with previous pre-training methods.

Such efforts\ntypically assume the transition dynamics or value function of the MDP are\ndescribed by linear functions of the state features. To resolve this\ndiscrepancy between theory and practice, we introduce the Effective Planning\nWindow (EPW) condition, a structural condition on MDPs that makes no linearity\nassumptions. We demonstrate that the EPW condition permits sample efficient RL,\nby providing an algorithm which provably solves MDPs satisfying this condition.\nOur algorithm requires minimal assumptions on the policy class, which can\ninclude multi-layer neural networks with nonlinear activation functions.\nNotably, the EPW condition is directly motivated by popular gaming benchmarks,\nand we show that many classic Atari games satisfy this condition.

Existing\ntensor decomposition objectives (e.g., Frobenius norm) are designed for fitting\nraw data under statistical assumptions, which may not align with downstream\nclassification tasks. Also, real-world tensor data are usually high-ordered and\nhave large dimensions with millions or billions of entries. Thus, it is\nexpensive to decompose the whole tensor with traditional algorithms. In\npractice, raw tensor data also contains redundant information while data\naugmentation techniques may be used to smooth out noise in samples. This paper\naddresses the above challenges by proposing augmented tensor decomposition\n(ATD), which effectively incorporates data augmentations to boost downstream\nclassification. To reduce the memory footprint of the decomposition, we propose\na stochastic algorithm that updates the factor matrices in a batch fashion. We\nevaluate ATD on multiple signal datasets. It shows comparable or better\nperformance (e.g., up to 15% in accuracy) over self-supervised and autoencoder\nbaselines with less than 5% of model parameters, achieves 0.6% ~ 1.3% accuracy\ngain over other tensor-based baselines, and reduces the memory footprint by 9X\nwhen compared to standard tensor decomposition algorithms.",

          "description": "We propose a simple yet effective method to compress an RNN-Transducer\n(RNN-T) through the well-known knowledge distillation paradigm. We show that\nthe transducer's encoder outputs naturally have a high entropy and contain rich\ninformation about acoustically similar word-piece confusions. This rich\ninformation is suppressed when combined with the lower entropy decoder outputs\nto produce the joint network logits. Consequently, we introduce an auxiliary\nloss to distill the encoder logits from a teacher transducer's encoder, and\nexplore training strategies where this encoder distillation works effectively.\nWe find that tandem training of teacher and student encoders with an inplace\nencoder distillation outperforms the use of a pre-trained and static teacher\ntransducer. We also report an interesting phenomenon we refer to as implicit\ndistillation, that occurs when the teacher and student encoders share the same\ndecoder. Our experiments show 5.37-8.4% relative word error rate reductions\n(WERR) on in-house test sets, and 5.05-6.18% relative WERRs on LibriSpeech test\nsets.",

          "description": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of adult death in the\nUnited States and worldwide, and for which the coronary angiography procedure\nis the primary gateway for diagnosis and clinical management decisions. The\nstandard-of-care for interpretation of coronary angiograms depends upon ad-hoc\nvisual assessment by the physician operator. However, ad-hoc visual\ninterpretation of angiograms is poorly reproducible, highly variable and bias\nprone. Here we show for the first time that fully-automated angiogram\ninterpretation to estimate coronary artery stenosis is possible using a\nsequence of deep neural network algorithms. The algorithmic pipeline we\ndeveloped--called CathAI--achieves state-of-the art performance across the\nsequence of tasks required to accomplish automated interpretation of\nunselected, real-world angiograms. CathAI (Algorithms 1-2) demonstrated\npositive predictive value, sensitivity and F1 score of >=90% to identify the\nprojection angle overall and >=93% for left or right coronary artery angiogram\ndetection, the primary anatomic structures of interest. To predict obstructive\ncoronary artery stenosis (>=70% stenosis), CathAI (Algorithm 4) exhibited an\narea under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.862 (95% CI:\n0.843-0.880). When externally validated in a healthcare system in another\ncountry, CathAI AUC was 0.869 (95% CI: 0.830-0.907) to predict obstructive\ncoronary artery stenosis. Our results demonstrate that multiple purpose-built\nneural networks can function in sequence to accomplish the complex series of\ntasks required for automated analysis of real-world angiograms. Deployment of\nCathAI may serve to increase standardization and reproducibility in coronary\nstenosis assessment, while providing a robust foundation to accomplish future\ntasks for algorithmic angiographic interpretation.",

To further underline its biological\nplausibility, we relate DFC to a multi-compartment model of cortical pyramidal\nneurons with a local voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity rule, consistent\nwith recent theories of dendritic processing. By combining dynamical system\ntheory with mathematical optimization theory, we provide a strong theoretical\nfoundation for DFC that we corroborate with detailed results on toy experiments\nand standard computer-vision benchmarks.",

However, the current state-of-the-art\nSSL algorithms are computationally expensive and entail significant compute\ntime and energy requirements. This can prove to be a huge limitation for many\nsmaller companies and academic groups. Our main insight is that training on a\nsubset of unlabeled data instead of entire unlabeled data enables the current\nSSL algorithms to converge faster, thereby reducing the computational costs\nsignificantly. In this work, we propose RETRIEVE, a coreset selection framework\nfor efficient and robust semi-supervised learning. RETRIEVE selects the coreset\nby solving a mixed discrete-continuous bi-level optimization problem such that\nthe selected coreset minimizes the labeled set loss. We use a one-step gradient\napproximation and show that the discrete optimization problem is approximately\nsubmodular, thereby enabling simple greedy algorithms to obtain the coreset. We\nempirically demonstrate on several real-world datasets that existing SSL\nalgorithms like VAT, Mean-Teacher, FixMatch, when used with RETRIEVE, achieve\na) faster training times, b) better performance when unlabeled data consists of\nOut-of-Distribution(OOD) data and imbalance. More specifically, we show that\nwith minimal accuracy degradation, RETRIEVE achieves a speedup of around 3X in\nthe traditional SSL setting and achieves a speedup of 5X compared to\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) robust SSL algorithms in the case of imbalance and OOD\ndata.",

          "description": "The spectacular success of deep generative models calls for quantitative\ntools to measure their statistical performance. Divergence frontiers have\nrecently been proposed as an evaluation framework for generative models, due to\ntheir ability to measure the quality-diversity trade-off inherent to deep\ngenerative modeling. However, the statistical behavior of divergence frontiers\nestimated from data remains unknown to this day. In this paper, we establish\nnon-asymptotic bounds on the sample complexity of the plug-in estimator of\ndivergence frontiers. Along the way, we introduce a novel integral summary of\ndivergence frontiers. We derive the corresponding non-asymptotic bounds and\ndiscuss the choice of the quantization level by balancing the two types of\napproximation errors arisen from its computation. We also augment the\ndivergence frontier framework by investigating the statistical performance of\nsmoothed distribution estimators such as the Good-Turing estimator. We\nillustrate the theoretical results with numerical examples from natural\nlanguage processing and computer vision.",

          "description": "Meta-reinforcement learning algorithms can enable robots to acquire new\nskills much more quickly, by leveraging prior experience to learn how to learn.\nHowever, much of the current research on meta-reinforcement learning focuses on\ntask distributions that are very narrow. For example, a commonly used\nmeta-reinforcement learning benchmark uses different running velocities for a\nsimulated robot as different tasks. When policies are meta-trained on such\nnarrow task distributions, they cannot possibly generalize to more quickly\nacquire entirely new tasks. Therefore, if the aim of these methods is to enable\nfaster acquisition of entirely new behaviors, we must evaluate them on task\ndistributions that are sufficiently broad to enable generalization to new\nbehaviors. In this paper, we propose an open-source simulated benchmark for\nmeta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning consisting of 50 distinct\nrobotic manipulation tasks. Our aim is to make it possible to develop\nalgorithms that generalize to accelerate the acquisition of entirely new,\nheld-out tasks. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art meta-reinforcement learning and\nmulti-task learning algorithms on these tasks. Surprisingly, while each task\nand its variations (e.g., with different object positions) can be learned with\nreasonable success, these algorithms struggle to learn with multiple tasks at\nthe same time, even with as few as ten distinct training tasks. Our analysis\nand open-source environments pave the way for future research in multi-task\nlearning and meta-learning that can enable meaningful generalization, thereby\nunlocking the full potential of these methods.",

          "description": "While neural networks have advanced the frontiers in many applications, they\noften come at a high computational cost. Reducing the power and latency of\nneural network inference is key if we want to integrate modern networks into\nedge devices with strict power and compute requirements. Neural network\nquantization is one of the most effective ways of achieving these savings but\nthe additional noise it induces can lead to accuracy degradation. In this white\npaper, we introduce state-of-the-art algorithms for mitigating the impact of\nquantization noise on the network's performance while maintaining low-bit\nweights and activations. We start with a hardware motivated introduction to\nquantization and then consider two main classes of algorithms: Post-Training\nQuantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware-Training (QAT). PTQ requires no\nre-training or labelled data and is thus a lightweight push-button approach to\nquantization. In most cases, PTQ is sufficient for achieving 8-bit quantization\nwith close to floating-point accuracy. QAT requires fine-tuning and access to\nlabeled training data but enables lower bit quantization with competitive\nresults. For both solutions, we provide tested pipelines based on existing\nliterature and extensive experimentation that lead to state-of-the-art\nperformance for common deep learning models and tasks.",

          "description": "Machine learning is revolutionizing image-based diagnostics in pathology and\nradiology. ML models have shown promising results in research settings, but\ntheir lack of interoperability has been a major barrier for clinical\nintegration and evaluation. The DICOM a standard specifies Information Object\nDefinitions and Services for the representation and communication of digital\nimages and related information, including image-derived annotations and\nanalysis results. However, the complexity of the standard represents an\nobstacle for its adoption in the ML community and creates a need for software\nlibraries and tools that simplify working with data sets in DICOM format. Here\nwe present the highdicom library, which provides a high-level application\nprogramming interface for the Python programming language that abstracts\nlow-level details of the standard and enables encoding and decoding of\nimage-derived information in DICOM format in a few lines of Python code. The\nhighdicom library ties into the extensive Python ecosystem for image processing\nand machine learning. Simultaneously, by simplifying creation and parsing of\nDICOM-compliant files, highdicom achieves interoperability with the medical\nimaging systems that hold the data used to train and run ML models, and\nultimately communicate and store model outputs for clinical use. We demonstrate\nthrough experiments with slide microscopy and computed tomography imaging,\nthat, by bridging these two ecosystems, highdicom enables developers to train\nand evaluate state-of-the-art ML models in pathology and radiology while\nremaining compliant with the DICOM standard and interoperable with clinical\nsystems at all stages.

          "description": "Nowadays, subsurface salt body localization and delineation, also called\nsemantic segmentation of salt bodies, are among the most challenging\ngeophysicist tasks. Thus, identifying large salt bodies is notoriously tricky\nand is crucial for identifying hydrocarbon reservoirs and drill path planning.\nThis work proposes a Data Augmentation method based on training two generative\nmodels to augment the number of samples in a seismic image dataset for the\nsemantic segmentation of salt bodies. Our method uses deep learning models to\ngenerate pairs of seismic image patches and their respective salt masks for the\nData Augmentation. The first model is a Variational Autoencoder and is\nresponsible for generating patches of salt body masks. The second is a\nConditional Normalizing Flow model, which receives the generated masks as\ninputs and generates the associated seismic image patches. We evaluate the\nproposed method by comparing the performance of ten distinct state-of-the-art\nmodels for semantic segmentation, trained with and without the generated\naugmentations, in a dataset from two synthetic seismic images. The proposed\nmethodology yields an average improvement of 8.57% in the IoU metric across all\ncompared models. The best result is achieved by a DeeplabV3+ model variant,\nwhich presents an IoU score of 95.17% when trained with our augmentations.\nAdditionally, our proposal outperformed six selected data augmentation methods,\nand the most significant improvement in the comparison, of 9.77%, is achieved\nby composing our DA with augmentations from an elastic transformation. At last,\nwe show that the proposed method is adaptable for a larger context size by\nachieving results comparable to the obtained on the smaller context size.",

          "description": "Learning meaningful representations of data is an important aspect of machine\nlearning and has recently been successfully applied to many domains like\nlanguage understanding or computer vision. Instead of training a model for one\nspecific task, representation learning is about training a model to capture all\nuseful information in the underlying data and make it accessible for a\npredictor. For predictive process analytics, it is essential to have all\nexplanatory characteristics of a process instance available when making\npredictions about the future, as well as for clustering and anomaly detection.\nDue to the large variety of perspectives and types within business process\ndata, generating a good representation is a challenging task. In this paper, we\npropose a novel approach for representation learning of business process\ninstances which can process and combine most perspectives in an event log. In\nconjunction with a self-supervised pre-training method, we show the\ncapabilities of the approach through a visualization of the representation\nspace and case retrieval. Furthermore, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned to\nmultiple process prediction tasks and demonstrates its effectiveness in\ncomparison with existing approaches.",

In\nthis work, we present a machine learning (ML) model that can learn and predict\nthe aqueous solvation free energy of an organic molecule using Gaussian process\nregression method based on a new molecular graph kernel. To investigate the\nperformance of the ML model on electrostatic interaction, the nonpolar\ninteraction contribution of solvent and the conformational entropy of solute in\nsolvation free energy, three data sets with implicit or explicit water solvent\nmodels, and contribution of conformational entropy of solute are tested. We\ndemonstrate that our ML model can predict the solvation free energy of\nmolecules at chemical accuracy with a mean absolute error of less than 1\nkcal/mol for subsets of the QM9 dataset and the Freesolv database. To solve the\ngeneral data scarcity problem for a graph-based ML model, we propose a\ndimension reduction algorithm based on the distance between molecular graphs,\nwhich can be used to examine the diversity of the molecular data set. It\nprovides a promising way to build a minimum training set to improve prediction\nfor certain test sets where the space of molecular structures is predetermined.",

          "description": "Deep learning models are routinely employed in computational pathology\n(CPath) for solving problems of diagnostic and prognostic significance.\nTypically, the generalization performance of CPath models is analyzed using\nevaluation protocols such as cross-validation and testing on multi-centric\ncohorts. However, to ensure that such CPath solutions are robust and safe for\nuse in a clinical setting, a critical analysis of their predictive performance\nand vulnerability to adversarial attacks is required, which is the focus of\nthis paper. Specifically, we show that a highly accurate model for\nclassification of tumour patches in pathology images (AUC > 0.95) can easily be\nattacked with minimal perturbations which are imperceptible to lay humans and\ntrained pathologists alike. Our analytical results show that it is possible to\ngenerate single-instance white-box attacks on specific input images with high\nsuccess rate and low perturbation energy. Furthermore, we have also generated a\nsingle universal perturbation matrix using the training dataset only which,\nwhen added to unseen test images, results in forcing the trained neural network\nto flip its prediction labels with high confidence at a success rate of > 84%.\nWe systematically analyze the relationship between perturbation energy of an\nadversarial attack, its impact on morphological constructs of clinical\nsignificance, their perceptibility by a trained pathologist and saliency maps\nobtained using deep learning models. Based on our analysis, we strongly\nrecommend that computational pathology models be critically analyzed using the\nproposed adversarial validation strategy prior to clinical adoption.",

          "description": "Can machine learning help us make better decisions about a changing planet?\nIn this paper, we illustrate and discuss the potential of a promising corner of\nmachine learning known as _reinforcement learning_ (RL) to help tackle the most\nchallenging conservation decision problems. RL is uniquely well suited to\nconservation and global change challenges for three reasons: (1) RL explicitly\nfocuses on designing an agent who _interacts_ with an environment which is\ndynamic and uncertain, (2) RL approaches do not require massive amounts of\ndata, (3) RL approaches would utilize rather than replace existing models,\nsimulations, and the knowledge they contain. We provide a conceptual and\ntechnical introduction to RL and its relevance to ecological and conservation\nchallenges, including examples of a problem in setting fisheries quotas and in\nmanaging ecological tipping points. Four appendices with annotated code provide\na tangible introduction to researchers looking to adopt, evaluate, or extend\nthese approaches.",

The state of the art for semantic representation and\ninference is deep learning, and particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and transformer Self-Attention models.\nThis thesis investigates the use of deep learning for novel semantic\nrepresentation and inference, and makes contributions in the following three\nareas: creating training data, improving semantic representations and extending\ninference learning. In terms of creating training data, we contribute the\nlargest publicly available dataset of real-life factual claims for the purpose\nof automatic claim verification (MultiFC), and we present a novel inference\nmodel composed of multi-scale CNNs with different kernel sizes that learn from\nexternal sources to infer fact checking labels. In terms of improving semantic\nrepresentations, we contribute a novel model that captures non-compositional\nsemantic indicators. By definition, the meaning of a non-compositional phrase\ncannot be inferred from the individual meanings of its composing words (e.g.,\nhot dog). Motivated by this, we operationalize the compositionality of a phrase\ncontextually by enriching the phrase representation with external word\nembeddings and knowledge graphs. Finally, in terms of inference learning, we\npropose a series of novel deep learning architectures that improve inference by\nusing syntactic dependencies, by ensembling role guided attention heads,\nincorporating gating layers, and concatenating multiple heads in novel and\neffective ways.

We introduce a taxonomy of fairness ideals using doctrines of Equality\nof Opportunity (EOP) from political philosophy, clarifying their conceptions in\nphilosophy and the proposed codification in fair machine learning. We arrange\nthese fairness ideals onto an EOP spectrum, which serves as a useful frame to\nguide the design of a fair ADS in a given context.\n\nWe use our fairness-as-EOP framework to re-interpret the impossibility\nresults from a philosophical perspective, as the in-compatibility between\ndifferent value systems, and demonstrate the utility of the framework with\nseveral real-world and hypothetical examples.

          "description": "Principled decision making in emergency response management necessitates the\nuse of statistical models that predict the spatial-temporal likelihood of\nincident occurrence. These statistical models are then used for proactive\nstationing which allocates first responders across the spatial area in order to\nreduce overall response time. Traditional methods that simply aggregate past\nincidents over space and time fail to make useful short-term predictions when\nthe spatial region is large and focused on fine-grained spatial entities like\ninterstate highway networks. This is partially due to the sparsity of incidents\nwith respect to the area in consideration. Further, accidents are affected by\nseveral covariates, and collecting, cleaning, and managing multiple streams of\ndata from various sources is challenging for large spatial areas. In this\npaper, we highlight how this problem is being solved for the state of\nTennessee, a state in the USA with a total area of over 100,000 sq. km. Our\npipeline, based on a combination of synthetic resampling, non-spatial\nclustering, and learning from data can efficiently forecast the spatial and\ntemporal dynamics of accident occurrence, even under sparse conditions. In the\npaper, we describe our pipeline that uses data related to roadway geometry,\nweather, historical accidents, and real-time traffic congestion to aid accident\nforecasting. To understand how our forecasting model can affect allocation and\ndispatch, we improve upon a classical resource allocation approach.\nExperimental results show that our approach can significantly reduce response\ntimes in the field in comparison with current approaches followed by first\nresponders.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved remarkable performance in various\nfields. However, training a DNN model from scratch requires a lot of computing\nresources and training data. It is difficult for most individual users to\nobtain such computing resources and training data. Model copyright infringement\nis an emerging problem in recent years. For instance, pre-trained models may be\nstolen or abuse by illegal users without the authorization of the model owner.\nRecently, many works on protecting the intellectual property of DNN models have\nbeen proposed. In these works, embedding watermarks into DNN based on backdoor\nis one of the widely used methods. However, when the DNN model is stolen, the\nbackdoor-based watermark may face the risk of being detected and removed by an\nadversary. In this paper, we propose a scheme to detect and remove watermark in\ndeep neural networks via generative adversarial networks (GAN). We demonstrate\nthat the backdoor-based DNN watermarks are vulnerable to the proposed GAN-based\nwatermark removal attack. The proposed attack method includes two phases. In\nthe first phase, we use the GAN and few clean images to detect and reverse the\nwatermark in the DNN model. In the second phase, we fine-tune the watermarked\nDNN based on the reversed backdoor images. Experimental evaluations on the\nMNIST and CIFAR10 datasets demonstrate that, the proposed method can\neffectively remove about 98% of the watermark in DNN models, as the watermark\nretention rate reduces from 100% to less than 2% after applying the proposed\nattack. In the meantime, the proposed attack hardly affects the model's\nperformance. The test accuracy of the watermarked DNN on the MNIST and the\nCIFAR10 datasets drops by less than 1% and 3%, respectively.",

As ANNs become more ubiquitous, it is imperative\nto understand their associated safety, security, and privacy vulnerabilities.\nRecently, it has been shown that ANNs are susceptible to a number of\nadversarial evasion attacks--inputs that cause the ANN to make high-confidence\nmisclassifications despite being almost indistinguishable from the data used to\ntrain and test the network. This work explores to what degree finding these\nexamples maybe aided by using side-channel information, specifically switching\npower consumption, of hardware implementations of ANNs. A black-box threat\nscenario is assumed, where an attacker has access to the ANN hardware's input,\noutputs, and topology, but the trained model parameters are unknown. Then, a\nsurrogate model is trained to have similar functional (i.e. input-output\nmapping) and switching power characteristics as the oracle (black-box) model.\nOur results indicate that the inclusion of power consumption data increases the\nfidelity of the model extraction by up to 30 percent based on a mean square\nerror comparison of the oracle and surrogate weights. However, transferability\nof adversarial examples from the surrogate to the oracle model was not\nsignificantly affected.",

          "description": "Biological agents are known to learn many different tasks over the course of\ntheir lives, and to be able to revisit previous tasks and behaviors with little\nto no loss in performance. In contrast, artificial agents are prone to\n'catastrophic forgetting' whereby performance on previous tasks deteriorates\nrapidly as new ones are acquired. This shortcoming has recently been addressed\nusing methods that encourage parameters to stay close to those used for\nprevious tasks. This can be done by (i) using specific parameter regularizers\nthat map out suitable destinations in parameter space, or (ii) guiding the\noptimization journey by projecting gradients into subspaces that do not\ninterfere with previous tasks. However, parameter regularization has been shown\nto be relatively ineffective in recurrent neural networks (RNNs), a setting\nrelevant to the study of neural dynamics supporting biological continual\nlearning. Similarly, projection based methods can reach capacity and fail to\nlearn any further as the number of tasks increases. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Natural Continual Learning (NCL), a new method that\nunifies weight regularization and projected gradient descent. NCL uses Bayesian\nweight regularization to encourage good performance on all tasks at convergence\nand combines this with gradient projections designed to prevent catastrophic\nforgetting during optimization. NCL formalizes gradient projection as a trust\nregion algorithm based on the Fisher information metric, and achieves\nscalability via a novel Kronecker-factored approximation strategy. Our method\noutperforms both standard weight regularization techniques and projection based\napproaches when applied to continual learning problems in RNNs. The trained\nnetworks evolve task-specific dynamics that are strongly preserved as new tasks\nare learned, similar to experimental findings in biological circuits.",

          "description": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success in\nperforming cognitive tasks. However, execution of CNNs requires a large amount\nof computing resources and generates heavy memory traffic, which imposes a\nsevere challenge on computing system design. Through optimizing parallel\nexecutions and data reuse in convolution, systolic architecture demonstrates\ngreat advantages in accelerating CNN computations. However, regular internal\ndata transmission path in traditional systolic architecture prevents the\nsystolic architecture from completely leveraging the benefits introduced by\nneural network sparsity. Deployment of fine-grained sparsity on the existing\nsystolic architectures is greatly hindered by the incurred computational\noverheads. In this work, we propose S2Engine $-$ a novel systolic architecture\nthat can fully exploit the sparsity in CNNs with maximized data reuse. S2Engine\ntransmits compressed data internally and allows each processing element to\ndynamically select an aligned data from the compressed dataflow in convolution.\nCompared to the naive systolic array, S2Engine achieves about $3.2\\times$ and\nabout $3.0\\times$ improvements on speed and energy efficiency, respectively.",

          "description": "In recent research, human-understandable explanations of machine learning\nmodels have received a lot of attention. Often explanations are given in form\nof model simplifications or visualizations. However, as shown in cognitive\nscience as well as in early AI research, concept understanding can also be\nimproved by the alignment of a given instance for a concept with a similar\ncounterexample. Contrasting a given instance with a structurally similar\nexample which does not belong to the concept highlights what characteristics\nare necessary for concept membership. Such near misses have been proposed by\nWinston (1970) as efficient guidance for learning in relational domains. We\nintroduce an explanation generation algorithm for relational concepts learned\nwith Inductive Logic Programming (\\textsc{GeNME}). The algorithm identifies\nnear miss examples from a given set of instances and ranks these examples by\ntheir degree of closeness to a specific positive instance. A modified rule\nwhich covers the near miss but not the original instance is given as an\nexplanation. We illustrate \\textsc{GeNME} with the well known family domain\nconsisting of kinship relations, the visual relational Winston arches domain\nand a real-world domain dealing with file management. We also present a\npsychological experiment comparing human preferences of rule-based,\nexample-based, and near miss explanations in the family and the arches domains.",

          "description": "In recent years, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has achieved notable\nresults in various translation tasks. However, the word-by-word generation\nmanner determined by the autoregressive mechanism leads to high translation\nlatency of the NMT and restricts its low-latency applications.\nNon-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation (NAT) removes the autoregressive\nmechanism and achieves significant decoding speedup through generating target\nwords independently and simultaneously. Nevertheless, NAT still takes the\nword-level cross-entropy loss as the training objective, which is not optimal\nbecause the output of NAT cannot be properly evaluated due to the multimodality\nproblem. In this paper, we propose using sequence-level training objectives to\ntrain NAT models, which evaluate the NAT outputs as a whole and correlates well\nwith the real translation quality. Firstly, we propose training NAT models to\noptimize sequence-level evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU) based on several novel\nreinforcement algorithms customized for NAT, which outperforms the conventional\nmethod by reducing the variance of gradient estimation. Secondly, we introduce\na novel training objective for NAT models, which aims to minimize the\nBag-of-Ngrams (BoN) difference between the model output and the reference\nsentence. The BoN training objective is differentiable and can be calculated\nefficiently without doing any approximations. Finally, we apply a three-stage\ntraining strategy to combine these two methods to train the NAT model. We\nvalidate our approach on four translation tasks (WMT14 En$\\leftrightarrow$De,\nWMT16 En$\\leftrightarrow$Ro), which shows that our approach largely outperforms\nNAT baselines and achieves remarkable performance on all translation tasks.",

          "description": "Recent advances in deep learning renewed the research interests in machine\nlearning for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Specifically,\nattention has been given to sequential learning models, due to their ability to\nextract the temporal characteristics of Network traffic Flows (NetFlows), and\nuse them for NIDS tasks. However, the applications of these sequential models\noften consist of transferring and adapting methodologies directly from other\nfields, without an in-depth investigation on how to leverage the specific\ncircumstances of cybersecurity scenarios; moreover, there is a lack of\ncomprehensive studies on sequential models that rely on NetFlow data, which\npresents significant advantages over traditional full packet captures. We\ntackle this problem in this paper. We propose a detailed methodology to extract\ntemporal sequences of NetFlows that denote patterns of malicious activities.\nThen, we apply this methodology to compare the efficacy of sequential learning\nmodels against traditional static learning models. In particular, we perform a\nfair comparison of a `sequential' Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) against a\n`static' Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) in distinct environments represented\nby two well-known datasets for NIDS: the CICIDS2017 and the CTU13. Our results\nhighlight that LSTM achieves comparable performance to FNN in the CICIDS2017\nwith over 99.5\\% F1-score; while obtaining superior performance in the CTU13,\nwith 95.7\\% F1-score against 91.5\\%. This paper thus paves the way to future\napplications of sequential learning models for NIDS.",

          "description": "Multi-hop logical reasoning is an established problem in the field of\nrepresentation learning on knowledge graphs (KGs). It subsumes both one-hop\nlink prediction as well as other more complex types of logical queries.\nExisting algorithms operate only on classical, triple-based graphs, whereas\nmodern KGs often employ a hyper-relational modeling paradigm. In this paradigm,\ntyped edges may have several key-value pairs known as qualifiers that provide\nfine-grained context for facts. In queries, this context modifies the meaning\nof relations, and usually reduces the answer set. Hyper-relational queries are\noften observed in real-world KG applications, and existing approaches for\napproximate query answering cannot make use of qualifier pairs. In this work,\nwe bridge this gap and extend the multi-hop reasoning problem to\nhyper-relational KGs allowing to tackle this new type of complex queries.\nBuilding upon recent advancements in Graph Neural Networks and query embedding\ntechniques, we study how to embed and answer hyper-relational conjunctive\nqueries. Besides that, we propose a method to answer such queries and\ndemonstrate in our experiments that qualifiers improve query answering on a\ndiverse set of query patterns.",

As a case study, rainfall-runoff\nmodeling in a snow-dominated watershed by means of a long- and short-term\nmemory (LSTM) network is selected. Daily precipitation and mean air temperature\nwere used as model input to estimate daily flow discharge. After model training\nand verification, two experimental simulations were conducted with hypothetical\ninputs instead of observed meteorological data to clarify the response of the\ntrained model to the inputs. The first numerical experiment showed that even\nwithout input precipitation, the trained model generated flow discharge,\nparticularly winter low flow and high flow during the snow-melting period. The\neffects of warmer and colder conditions on the flow discharge were also\nreplicated by the trained model without precipitation. Additionally, the model\nreflected only 17-39% of the total precipitation mass during the snow\naccumulation period in the total annual flow discharge, revealing a strong lack\nof water mass conservation.

          "description": "Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are widespread in critical domains, and\nsignificant damage can be caused if an attacker is able to modify the code of\ntheir programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Unfortunately, traditional\ntechniques for attesting code integrity (i.e. verifying that it has not been\nmodified) rely on firmware access or roots-of-trust, neither of which\nproprietary or legacy PLCs are likely to provide. In this paper, we propose a\npractical code integrity checking solution based on privacy-preserving black\nbox models that instead attest the input/output behaviour of PLC programs.\nUsing faithful offline copies of the PLC programs, we identify their most\nimportant inputs through an information flow analysis, execute them on multiple\ncombinations to collect data, then train neural networks able to predict PLC\noutputs (i.e. actuator commands) from their inputs. By exploiting the black box\nnature of the model, our solution maintains the privacy of the original PLC\ncode and does not assume that attackers are unaware of its presence. The trust\ninstead comes from the fact that it is extremely hard to attack the PLC code\nand neural networks at the same time and with consistent outcomes. We evaluated\nour approach on a modern six-stage water treatment plant testbed, finding that\nit could predict actuator states from PLC inputs with near-100% accuracy, and\nthus could detect all 120 effective code mutations that we subjected the PLCs\nto. Finally, we found that it is not practically possible to simultaneously\nmodify the PLC code and apply discreet adversarial noise to our attesters in a\nway that leads to consistent (mis-)predictions.",

MobILE involves carefully trading off strategic exploration against\nimitation - this is achieved by integrating the idea of optimism in the face of\nuncertainty into the distribution matching imitation learning (IL) framework.\nWe provide a unified analysis for MobILE, and demonstrate that MobILE enjoys\nstrong performance guarantees for classes of MDP dynamics that satisfy certain\nwell studied notions of structural complexity. We also show that the ILFO\nproblem is strictly harder than the standard IL problem by presenting an\nexponential sample complexity separation between IL and ILFO.

In this\npaper, we identify the important risk factors that contribute to loan status\nclassification problem. Then we compare the the performance between\nboosting-type algorithms(especially CatBoost) with other traditional yet\npopular ones. The dataset we adopt in the research comes from the U.S. Small\nBusiness Administration (SBA) and holds a very large sample size (899,164\nobservations and 27 features). We obtain a high accuracy of 95.74% and\nwell-performed AUC of 98.59% compared with the existent literature of related\nresearch.

          "description": "Conventional unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation (UMDA) methods\nassume all source domains can be accessed directly. This neglects the\nprivacy-preserving policy, that is, all the data and computations must be kept\ndecentralized. There exists three problems in this scenario: (1) Minimizing the\ndomain distance requires the pairwise calculation of the data from source and\ntarget domains, which is not accessible. (2) The communication cost and privacy\nsecurity limit the application of UMDA methods (e.g., the domain adversarial\ntraining). (3) Since users have no authority to check the data quality, the\nirrelevant or malicious source domains are more likely to appear, which causes\nnegative transfer. In this study, we propose a privacy-preserving UMDA paradigm\nnamed Knowledge Distillation based Decentralized Domain Adaptation (KD3A),\nwhich performs domain adaptation through the knowledge distillation on models\nfrom different source domains. KD3A solves the above problems with three\ncomponents: (1) A multi-source knowledge distillation method named Knowledge\nVote to learn high-quality domain consensus knowledge. (2) A dynamic weighting\nstrategy named Consensus Focus to identify both the malicious and irrelevant\ndomains. (3) A decentralized optimization strategy for domain distance named\nBatchNorm MMD. The extensive experiments on DomainNet demonstrate that KD3A is\nrobust to the negative transfer and brings a 100x reduction of communication\ncost compared with other decentralized UMDA methods. Moreover, our KD3A\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art UMDA approaches.",

          "description": "With the increased usage of AI accelerators on mobile and edge devices,\non-device machine learning (ML) is gaining popularity. Consequently, thousands\nof proprietary ML models are being deployed on billions of untrusted devices.\nThis raises serious security concerns about model privacy. However, protecting\nthe model privacy without losing access to the AI accelerators is a challenging\nproblem. In this paper, we present a novel on-device model inference system,\nShadowNet. ShadowNet protects the model privacy with Trusted Execution\nEnvironment (TEE) while securely outsourcing the heavy linear layers of the\nmodel to the untrusted hardware accelerators. ShadowNet achieves this by\ntransforming the weights of the linear layers before outsourcing them and\nrestoring the results inside the TEE. The nonlinear layers are also kept secure\ninside the TEE. The transformation of the weights and the restoration of the\nresults are designed in a way that can be implemented efficiently. We have\nbuilt a ShadowNet prototype based on TensorFlow Lite and applied it on four\npopular CNNs, namely, MobileNets, ResNet-44, AlexNet and MiniVGG. Our\nevaluation shows that ShadowNet achieves strong security guarantees with\nreasonable performance, offering a practical solution for secure on-device\nmodel inference.",

Our proposed\nalgorithm differs from previous approaches in two key ways: the model\naggregates multiple sources mainly through the similarity of semantic\nconditional distribution rather than marginal distribution; the model proposes\na \\emph{unified} framework to select relevant sources for three popular\nscenarios, i.e., domain adaptation with limited label on target domain,\nunsupervised domain adaptation and label partial unsupervised domain adaption.\nWe evaluate the proposed method through extensive experiments. The empirical\nresults significantly outperform the baselines.",

          "description": "The label shift problem refers to the supervised learning setting where the\ntrain and test label distributions do not match. Existing work addressing label\nshift usually assumes access to an \\emph{unlabelled} test sample. This sample\nmay be used to estimate the test label distribution, and to then train a\nsuitably re-weighted classifier. While approaches using this idea have proven\neffective, their scope is limited as it is not always feasible to access the\ntarget domain; further, they require repeated retraining if the model is to be\ndeployed in \\emph{multiple} test environments. Can one instead learn a\n\\emph{single} classifier that is robust to arbitrary label shifts from a broad\nfamily? In this paper, we answer this question by proposing a model that\nminimises an objective based on distributionally robust optimisation (DRO). We\nthen design and analyse a gradient descent-proximal mirror ascent algorithm\ntailored for large-scale problems to optimise the proposed objective. %, and\nestablish its convergence.

Yet in machine\nlearning, curricula are not widely used and empirically often yield only\nmoderate benefits. This stark difference in the importance of curriculum raises\na fundamental theoretical question: when and why does curriculum learning help?\n\nIn this work, we analyse a prototypical neural network model of curriculum\nlearning in the high-dimensional limit, employing statistical physics methods.\nCurricula could in principle change both the learning speed and asymptotic\nperformance of a model. To study the former, we provide an exact description of\nthe online learning setting, confirming the long-standing experimental\nobservation that curricula can modestly speed up learning. To study the latter,\nwe derive performance in a batch learning setting, in which a network trains to\nconvergence in successive phases of learning on dataset slices of varying\ndifficulty. With standard training losses, curriculum does not provide\ngeneralisation benefit, in line with empirical observations. However, we show\nthat by connecting different learning phases through simple Gaussian priors,\ncurriculum can yield a large improvement in test performance. Taken together,\nour reduced analytical descriptions help reconcile apparently conflicting\nempirical results and trace regimes where curriculum learning yields the\nlargest gains.

Explanations sit at the core of these\ndesirable attributes of a ML system. The emerging field is frequently called\n``Explainable AI (XAI)'' or ``Explainable ML.'' The goal of explainable ML is\nto intuitively explain the predictions of a ML system, while adhering to the\nneeds to various stakeholders. Many explanation techniques were developed with\ncontributions from both academia and industry. However, there are several\nexisting challenges that have not garnered enough interest and serve as\nroadblocks to widespread adoption of explainable ML. In this short paper, we\nenumerate challenges in explainable ML from an industry perspective.

          "description": "Restless and collapsing bandits are commonly used to model constrained\nresource allocation in settings featuring arms with action-dependent transition\nprobabilities, such as allocating health interventions among patients [Whittle,\n1988; Mate et al., 2020]. However, state-of-the-art Whittle-index-based\napproaches to this planning problem either do not consider fairness among arms,\nor incentivize fairness without guaranteeing it [Mate et al., 2021].\nAdditionally, their optimality guarantees only apply when arms are indexable\nand threshold-optimal. We demonstrate that the incorporation of hard fairness\nconstraints necessitates the coupling of arms, which undermines the\ntractability, and by extension, indexability of the problem. We then introduce\nProbFair, a probabilistically fair stationary policy that maximizes total\nexpected reward and satisfies the budget constraint, while ensuring a strictly\npositive lower bound on the probability of being pulled at each timestep. We\nevaluate our algorithm on a real-world application, where interventions support\ncontinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy adherence among obstructive\nsleep apnea (OSA) patients, as well as simulations on a broader class of\nsynthetic transition matrices.",

          "description": "Adversarial examples contain carefully crafted perturbations that can fool\ndeep neural networks (DNNs) into making wrong predictions. Enhancing the\nadversarial robustness of DNNs has gained considerable interest in recent\nyears. Although image transformation-based defenses were widely considered at\nan earlier time, most of them have been defeated by adaptive attacks. In this\npaper, we propose a new image transformation defense based on error diffusion\nhalftoning, and combine it with adversarial training to defend against\nadversarial examples. Error diffusion halftoning projects an image into a 1-bit\nspace and diffuses quantization error to neighboring pixels. This process can\nremove adversarial perturbations from a given image while maintaining\nacceptable image quality in the meantime in favor of recognition. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed method is able to improve adversarial\nrobustness even under advanced adaptive attacks, while most of the other image\ntransformation-based defenses do not.

          "description": "Neural SDEs combine many of the best qualities of both RNNs and SDEs: memory\nefficient training, high-capacity function approximation, and strong priors on\nmodel space. This makes them a natural choice for modelling many types of\ntemporal dynamics. Training a Neural SDE (either as a VAE or as a GAN) requires\nbackpropagating through an SDE solve. This may be done by solving a\nbackwards-in-time SDE whose solution is the desired parameter gradients.\nHowever, this has previously suffered from severe speed and accuracy issues,\ndue to high computational cost and numerical truncation errors. Here, we\novercome these issues through several technical innovations. First, we\nintroduce the \\textit{reversible Heun method}. This is a new SDE solver that is\n\\textit{algebraically reversible}: eliminating numerical gradient errors, and\nthe first such solver of which we are aware. Moreover it requires half as many\nfunction evaluations as comparable solvers, giving up to a $1.98\\times$\nspeedup. Second, we introduce the \\textit{Brownian Interval}: a new, fast,\nmemory efficient, and exact way of sampling \\textit{and reconstructing}\nBrownian motion. With this we obtain up to a $10.6\\times$ speed improvement\nover previous techniques, which in contrast are both approximate and relatively\nslow. Third, when specifically training Neural SDEs as GANs (Kidger et al.\n2021), we demonstrate how SDE-GANs may be trained through careful weight\nclipping and choice of activation function. This reduces computational cost\n(giving up to a $1.87\\times$ speedup) and removes the numerical truncation\nerrors associated with gradient penalty. Altogether, we outperform the\nstate-of-the-art by substantial margins, with respect to training speed, and\nwith respect to classification, prediction, and MMD test metrics.

          "description": "Spectral clustering (SC) is one of the most popular clustering methods and\noften outperforms traditional clustering methods. SC uses the eigenvectors of a\nLaplacian matrix calculated from a similarity matrix of a dataset. SC has the\nserious drawbacks that are the significant increases in the time complexity\nderived from the computation of eigenvectors and the memory space complexity to\nstore the similarity matrix. To address the issues, I develop a new approximate\nspectral clustering using the network generated by growing neural gas (GNG),\ncalled ASC with GNG in this study. ASC with GNG uses not only reference vectors\nfor vector quantization but also the topology of the network for extraction of\nthe topological relationship between data points in a dataset. ASC with GNG\nmakes the similarity matrix from both the reference vectors and the topology of\nthe network generated by GNG. Using the network generated from a dataset by\nGNG, ASC with GNG achieves to reduce the computational and space complexities\nand improve clustering quality. In this study, I demonstrate that ASC with GNG\neffectively reduces computational time. Moreover, this study shows that ASC\nwith GNG displays equal to or better clustering performance than SC.",

          "description": "There are applications that may require removing the trace of a sample from\nthe system, e.g., a user requests their data to be deleted, or corrupted data\nis discovered. Simply removing a sample from storage units does not necessarily\nremove its entire trace since downstream machine learning models may store some\ninformation about the samples used to train them. A sample can be perfectly\nunlearned if we retrain all models that used it from scratch with that sample\nremoved from their training dataset. When multiple such unlearning requests are\nexpected to be served, unlearning by retraining becomes prohibitively\nexpensive. Ensemble learning enables the training data to be split into smaller\ndisjoint shards that are assigned to non-communicating weak learners. Each\nshard is used to produce a weak model. These models are then aggregated to\nproduce the final central model. This setup introduces an inherent trade-off\nbetween performance and unlearning cost, as reducing the shard size reduces the\nunlearning cost but may cause degradation in performance. In this paper, we\npropose a coded learning protocol where we utilize linear encoders to encode\nthe training data into shards prior to the learning phase. We also present the\ncorresponding unlearning protocol and show that it satisfies the perfect\nunlearning criterion. Our experimental results show that the proposed coded\nmachine unlearning provides a better performance versus unlearning cost\ntrade-off compared to the uncoded baseline.",

          "description": "The recent emergence of contrastive learning approaches facilitates the\nresearch on graph representation learning (GRL), introducing graph contrastive\nlearning (GCL) into the literature. These methods contrast semantically similar\nand dissimilar sample pairs to encode the semantics into node or graph\nembeddings. However, most existing works only performed model-level evaluation,\nand did not explore the combination space of modules for more comprehensive and\nsystematic studies. For effective module-level evaluation, we propose a\nframework that decomposes GCL models into four modules: (1) a sampler to\ngenerate anchor, positive and negative data samples (nodes or graphs); (2) an\nencoder and a readout function to get sample embeddings; (3) a discriminator to\nscore each sample pair (anchor-positive and anchor-negative); and (4) an\nestimator to define the loss function. Based on this framework, we conduct\ncontrolled experiments over a wide range of architectural designs and\nhyperparameter settings on node and graph classification tasks. Specifically,\nwe manage to quantify the impact of a single module, investigate the\ninteraction between modules, and compare the overall performance with current\nmodel architectures. Our key findings include a set of module-level guidelines\nfor GCL, e.g., simple samplers from LINE and DeepWalk are strong and robust; an\nMLP encoder associated with Sum readout could achieve competitive performance\non graph classification. Finally, we release our implementations and results as\nOpenGCL, a modularized toolkit that allows convenient reproduction, standard\nmodel and module evaluation, and easy extension.",

          "description": "In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on training deep neural\nnetworks capable of state-of-the-art performance without the need for the\nexpensive over-parameterization by proposing the concept of In-Time\nOver-Parameterization (ITOP) in sparse training. By starting from a random\nsparse network and continuously exploring sparse connectivities during\ntraining, we can perform an Over-Parameterization in the space-time manifold,\nclosing the gap in the expressibility between sparse training and dense\ntraining. We further use ITOP to understand the underlying mechanism of Dynamic\nSparse Training (DST) and indicate that the benefits of DST come from its\nability to consider across time all possible parameters when searching for the\noptimal sparse connectivity. As long as there are sufficient parameters that\nhave been reliably explored during training, DST can outperform the dense\nneural network by a large margin. We present a series of experiments to support\nour conjecture and achieve the state-of-the-art sparse training performance\nwith ResNet-50 on ImageNet. More impressively, our method achieves dominant\nperformance over the overparameterization-based sparse methods at extreme\nsparsity levels.

Apart from the wider research on handwritten digit\nrecognition on MNIST dataset, there are many other research works on various\nscript recognition. However, it is not very common for multi-script digit\nrecognition which encourage the development of robust and multipurpose systems.\nAdditionally working on multi-script digit recognition enables multi-task\nlearning, considering the script classification as a related task for instance.\nIt is evident that multi-task learning improves model performance through\ninductive transfer using the information contained in related tasks. Therefore,\nin this study multi-script handwritten digit recognition using multi-task\nlearning will be investigated. As a specific case of demonstrating the solution\nto the problem, Amharic handwritten character recognition will also be\nexperimented. The handwritten digits of three scripts including Latin, Arabic\nand Kannada are studied to show that multi-task models with reformulation of\nthe individual tasks have shown promising results. In this study a novel way of\nusing the individual tasks predictions was proposed to help classification\nperformance and regularize the different loss for the purpose of the main task.\nThis finding has outperformed the baseline and the conventional multi-task\nlearning models.

However, this approach has\npotential limitations, as the model learns to solve individual (source, target)\nexamples (i.e., at the instance level), instead of learning to solve tasks by\ntaking all examples within a task as a whole (i.e., at the task level). To this\nend, we introduce Hypter, a framework that improves text-to-text transformer's\ngeneralization ability to unseen tasks by training a hypernetwork to generate\ntask-specific, light-weight adapters from task descriptions.

          "description": "While multitask representation learning has become a popular approach in\nreinforcement learning (RL), theoretical understanding of why and when it works\nremains limited. This paper presents analyses for the statistical benefit of\nmultitask representation learning in linear Markov Decision Process (MDP) under\na generative model. In this paper, we consider an agent to learn a\nrepresentation function $\\phi$ out of a function class $\\Phi$ from $T$ source\ntasks with $N$ data per task, and then use the learned $\\hat{\\phi}$ to reduce\nthe required number of sample for a new task. We first discover a\n\\emph{Least-Activated-Feature-Abundance} (LAFA) criterion, denoted as $\\kappa$,\nwith which we prove that a straightforward least-square algorithm learns a\npolicy which is $\\tilde{O}(H^2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mathcal{C}(\\Phi)^2 \\kappa\nd}{NT}+\\frac{\\kappa d}{n}})$ sub-optimal. Here $H$ is the planning horizon,\n$\\mathcal{C}(\\Phi)$ is $\\Phi$'s complexity measure, $d$ is the dimension of the\nrepresentation (usually $d\\ll \\mathcal{C}(\\Phi)$) and $n$ is the number of\nsamples for the new task. Thus the required $n$ is $O(\\kappa d H^4)$ for the\nsub-optimality to be close to zero, which is much smaller than\n$O(\\mathcal{C}(\\Phi)^2\\kappa d H^4)$ in the setting without multitask\nrepresentation learning, whose sub-optimality gap is\n$\\tilde{O}(H^2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\kappa \\mathcal{C}(\\Phi)^2d}{n}})$. This\ntheoretically explains the power of multitask representation learning in\nreducing sample complexity. Further, we note that to ensure high sample\nefficiency, the LAFA criterion $\\kappa$ should be small. In fact, $\\kappa$\nvaries widely in magnitude depending on the different sampling distribution for\nnew task. This indicates adaptive sampling technique is important to make\n$\\kappa$ solely depend on $d$. Finally, we provide empirical results of a noisy\ngrid-world environment to corroborate our theoretical findings.",

We argue that model stitching is a powerful and perhaps\nunder-appreciated tool, which reveals aspects of representations that measures\nsuch as centered kernel alignment (CKA) cannot. Through extensive experiments,\nwe use model stitching to obtain quantitative verifications for intuitive\nstatements such as \"good networks learn similar representations'', by\ndemonstrating that good networks of the same architecture, but trained in very\ndifferent ways (e.g.: supervised vs. self-supervised learning), can be stitched\nto each other without drop in performance.

While\nmuch focus is placed on discovering what models learn, the question of how a\nmodel learns is less studied beyond theoretical landscape characterizations and\nlocal geometric approximations near optimal conditions. Here, we present a\ntoolkit for the Dynamical Organization Of Deep Learning Loss Landscapes, or\nDOODL3. DOODL3 formulates the training of neural networks as a dynamical\nsystem, analyzes the learning process, and presents an interpretable global\nview of trajectories in the loss landscape. Our approach uses the coarseness of\ntopology to capture the granularity of geometry to mitigate against states of\ninstability or elongated training. Overall, our analysis presents an empirical\nframework to extract the global dynamics of a model and to use that information\nto guide the training of neural networks.",

          "description": "Continuously-indexed flows (CIFs) have recently achieved improvements over\nbaseline normalizing flows on a variety of density estimation tasks. CIFs do\nnot possess a closed-form marginal density, and so, unlike standard flows,\ncannot be plugged in directly to a variational inference (VI) scheme in order\nto produce a more expressive family of approximate posteriors. However, we show\nhere how CIFs can be used as part of an auxiliary VI scheme to formulate and\ntrain expressive posterior approximations in a natural way. We exploit the\nconditional independence structure of multi-layer CIFs to build the required\nauxiliary inference models, which we show empirically yield low-variance\nestimators of the model evidence. We then demonstrate the advantages of CIFs\nover baseline flows in VI problems when the posterior distribution of interest\npossesses a complicated topology, obtaining improved results in both the\nBayesian inference and surrogate maximum likelihood settings.",

As state-of-the-art deep learning\narchitectures have continued to grow in parameter count so have the compute\nbudgets and times required to train them, increasing the need for\ncompute-efficient methods that parallelize training. Two common approaches to\nparallelize the training of deep networks have been data and model parallelism.\nWhile useful, data and model parallelism suffer from diminishing returns in\nterms of compute efficiency for large batch sizes. In this paper, we\ninvestigate how to continue scaling compute efficiently beyond the point of\ndiminishing returns for large batches through local parallelism, a framework\nwhich parallelizes training of individual layers in deep networks by replacing\nglobal backpropagation with truncated layer-wise backpropagation. Local\nparallelism enables fully asynchronous layer-wise parallelism with a low memory\nfootprint, and requires little communication overhead compared with model\nparallelism. We show results in both vision and language domains across a\ndiverse set of architectures, and find that local parallelism is particularly\neffective in the high-compute regime.",

          "description": "Neural networks have been achieving high generalization performance on many\ntasks despite being highly over-parameterized. Since classical statistical\nlearning theory struggles to explain this behavior, much effort has recently\nbeen focused on uncovering the mechanisms behind it, in the hope of developing\na more adequate theoretical framework and having a better control over the\ntrained models. In this work, we adopt an alternate perspective, viewing the\nneural network as a dynamical system displacing input particles over time. We\nconduct a series of experiments and, by analyzing the network's behavior\nthrough its displacements, we show the presence of a low kinetic energy\ndisplacement bias in the transport map of the network, and link this bias with\ngeneralization performance. From this observation, we reformulate the learning\nproblem as follows: finding neural networks which solve the task while\ntransporting the data as efficiently as possible. This offers a novel\nformulation of the learning problem which allows us to provide regularity\nresults for the solution network, based on Optimal Transport theory. From a\npractical viewpoint, this allows us to propose a new learning algorithm, which\nautomatically adapts to the complexity of the given task, and leads to networks\nwith a high generalization ability even in low data regimes.",

          "description": "This paper considers decentralized minimization of $N:=nm$ smooth non-convex\ncost functions equally divided over a directed network of $n$ nodes.\nSpecifically, we describe a stochastic first-order gradient method, called\nGT-SARAH, that employs a SARAH-type variance reduction technique and gradient\ntracking (GT) to address the stochastic and decentralized nature of the\nproblem. We show that GT-SARAH, with appropriate algorithmic parameters, finds\nan $\\epsilon$-accurate first-order stationary point with\n$O\\big(\\max\\big\\{N^{\\frac{1}{2}},n(1-\\lambda)^{-2},n^{\\frac{2}{3}}m^{\\frac{1}{3}}(1-\\lambda)^{-1}\\big\\}L\\epsilon^{-2}\\big)$\ngradient complexity, where ${(1-\\lambda)\\in(0,1]}$ is the spectral gap of the\nnetwork weight matrix and $L$ is the smoothness parameter of the cost\nfunctions. This gradient complexity outperforms that of the existing\ndecentralized stochastic gradient methods. In particular, in a big-data regime\nsuch that ${n = O(N^{\\frac{1}{2}}(1-\\lambda)^{3})}$, this gradient complexity\nfurthers reduces to ${O(N^{\\frac{1}{2}}L\\epsilon^{-2})}$, independent of the\nnetwork topology, and matches that of the centralized near-optimal\nvariance-reduced methods. Moreover, in this regime GT-SARAH achieves a\nnon-asymptotic linear speedup, in that, the total number of gradient\ncomputations at each node is reduced by a factor of $1/n$ compared to the\ncentralized near-optimal algorithms that perform all gradient computations at a\nsingle node. To the best of our knowledge, GT-SARAH is the first algorithm that\nachieves this property. In addition, we show that appropriate choices of local\nminibatch size balance the trade-offs between the gradient and communication\ncomplexity of GT-SARAH. Over infinite time horizon, we establish that all nodes\nin GT-SARAH asymptotically achieve consensus and converge to a first-order\nstationary point in the almost sure and mean-squared sense.",

          "description": "With the popularity of Machine Learning (ML) solutions, algorithms and data\nhave been released faster than the capacity of processing them. In this\ncontext, the problem of Algorithm Recommendation (AR) is receiving a\nsignificant deal of attention recently. This problem has been addressed in the\nliterature as a learning task, often as a Meta-Learning problem where the aim\nis to recommend the best alternative for a specific dataset. For such, datasets\nencoded by meta-features are explored by ML algorithms that try to learn the\nmapping between meta-representations and the best technique to be used. One of\nthe challenges for the successful use of ML is to define which features are the\nmost valuable for a specific dataset since several meta-features can be used,\nwhich increases the meta-feature dimension. This paper presents an empirical\nanalysis of Feature Selection and Feature Extraction in the meta-level for the\nAR problem. The present study was focused on three criteria: predictive\nperformance, dimensionality reduction, and pipeline runtime. As we verified,\napplying Dimensionality Reduction (DR) methods did not improve predictive\nperformances in general. However, DR solutions reduced about 80% of the\nmeta-features, obtaining pretty much the same performance as the original setup\nbut with lower runtimes. The only exception was PCA, which presented about the\nsame runtime as the original meta-features. Experimental results also showed\nthat various datasets have many non-informative meta-features and that it is\npossible to obtain high predictive performance using around 20% of the original\nmeta-features. Therefore, due to their natural trend for high dimensionality,\nDR methods should be used for Meta-Feature Selection and Meta-Feature\nExtraction.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks have been shown as a class of useful tools for\naddressing signal recognition issues in recent years, especially for\nidentifying the nonlinear feature structures of signals. However, this power of\nmost deep learning techniques heavily relies on an abundant amount of training\ndata, so the performance of classic neural nets decreases sharply when the\nnumber of training data samples is small or unseen data are presented in the\ntesting phase. This calls for an advanced strategy, i.e., model-agnostic\nmeta-learning (MAML), which is able to capture the invariant representation of\nthe data samples or signals. In this paper, inspired by the special structure\nof the signal, i.e., real and imaginary parts consisted in practical\ntime-series signals, we propose a Complex-valued Attentional MEta Learner\n(CAMEL) for the problem of few-shot signal recognition by leveraging attention\nand meta-learning in the complex domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nalso the first complex-valued MAML that can find the first-order stationary\npoints of general nonconvex problems with theoretical convergence guarantees.\nExtensive experiments results showcase the superiority of the proposed CAMEL\ncompared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

Recent\ndevelopments in deep semi-supervised classification have reached unprecedented\nperformance and the gap between supervised and semi-supervised learning is\never-decreasing. This improvement in performance has been based on the\ninclusion of numerous technical tricks, strong augmentation techniques and\ncostly optimisation schemes with multi-term loss functions. We propose a new\nframework, LaplaceNet, for deep semi-supervised classification that has a\ngreatly reduced model complexity.

Our model\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods for deep semi-supervised classification,\nover several benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we consider the application of\nstrong-augmentations to neural networks theoretically and justify the use of a\nmulti-sampling approach for semi-supervised learning. We demonstrate, through\nrigorous experimentation, that a multi-sampling augmentation approach improves\ngeneralisation and reduces the sensitivity of the network to augmentation.",

          "description": "Generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, or domain generalization,\nis one of the central problems in modern machine learning. Recently, there is a\nsurge of attempts to propose algorithms for OOD that mainly build upon the idea\nof extracting invariant features. Although intuitively reasonable, theoretical\nunderstanding of what kind of invariance can guarantee OOD generalization is\nstill limited, and generalization to arbitrary out-of-distribution is clearly\nimpossible. In this work, we take the first step towards rigorous and\nquantitative definitions of 1) what is OOD; and 2) what does it mean by saying\nan OOD problem is learnable. We also introduce a new concept of expansion\nfunction, which characterizes to what extent the variance is amplified in the\ntest domains over the training domains, and therefore give a quantitative\nmeaning of invariant features. Based on these, we prove OOD generalization\nerror bounds. It turns out that OOD generalization largely depends on the\nexpansion function. As recently pointed out by Gulrajani and Lopez-Paz (2020),\nany OOD learning algorithm without a model selection module is incomplete. Our\ntheory naturally induces a model selection criterion. Extensive experiments on\nbenchmark OOD datasets demonstrate that our model selection criterion has a\nsignificant advantage over baselines.",

          "description": "Hypergraph offers a framework to depict the multilateral relationships in\nreal-world complex data. Predicting higher-order relationships, i.e hyperedge,\nbecomes a fundamental problem for the full understanding of complicated\ninteractions. The development of graph neural network (GNN) has greatly\nadvanced the analysis of ordinary graphs with pair-wise relations. However,\nthese methods could not be easily extended to the case of hypergraph. In this\npaper, we generalize the challenges of GNN in representing higher-order data in\nprinciple, which are edge- and node-level ambiguities. To overcome the\nchallenges, we present SNALS that utilizes bipartite graph neural network with\nstructural features to collectively tackle the two ambiguity issues. SNALS\ncaptures the joint interactions of a hyperedge by its local environment, which\nis retrieved by collecting the spectrum information of their connections. As a\nresult, SNALS achieves nearly 30% performance increase compared with most\nrecent GNN-based models. In addition, we applied SNALS to predict genetic\nhigher-order interactions on 3D genome organization data. SNALS showed\nconsistently high prediction accuracy across different chromosomes, and\ngenerated novel findings on 4-way gene interaction, which is further validated\nby existing literature.",

          "description": "In recent years, various notions of capacity and complexity have been\nproposed for characterizing the generalization properties of stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD) in deep learning. Some of the popular notions that\ncorrelate well with the performance on unseen data are (i) the `flatness' of\nthe local minimum found by SGD, which is related to the eigenvalues of the\nHessian, (ii) the ratio of the stepsize $\\eta$ to the batch-size $b$, which\nessentially controls the magnitude of the stochastic gradient noise, and (iii)\nthe `tail-index', which measures the heaviness of the tails of the network\nweights at convergence. In this paper, we argue that these three seemingly\nunrelated perspectives for generalization are deeply linked to each other. We\nclaim that depending on the structure of the Hessian of the loss at the\nminimum, and the choices of the algorithm parameters $\\eta$ and $b$, the SGD\niterates will converge to a \\emph{heavy-tailed} stationary distribution. We\nrigorously prove this claim in the setting of quadratic optimization: we show\nthat even in a simple linear regression problem with independent and\nidentically distributed data whose distribution has finite moments of all\norder, the iterates can be heavy-tailed with infinite variance. We further\ncharacterize the behavior of the tails with respect to algorithm parameters,\nthe dimension, and the curvature. We then translate our results into insights\nabout the behavior of SGD in deep learning. We support our theory with\nexperiments conducted on synthetic data, fully connected, and convolutional\nneural networks.",
