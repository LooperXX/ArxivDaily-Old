        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We describe a method for the identification of models for dynamical systems
from observational data. The method is based on the concept of symbolic
regression and uses genetic programming to evolve a system of ordinary
differential equations (ODE). The novelty is that we add a step of
gradient-based optimization of the ODE parameters. For this we calculate the
sensitivities of the solution to the initial value problem (IVP) using
automatic differentiation. The proposed approach is tested on a set of 19
problem instances taken from the literature which includes datasets from
simulated systems as well as datasets captured from mechanical systems. We find
that gradient-based optimization of parameters improves predictive accuracy of
the models. The best results are obtained when we first fit the individual
equations to the numeric differences and then subsequently fine-tune the
identified parameter values by fitting the IVP solution to the observed
variable values.]]></summary>

into resource constrained embedded systems (e.g. low end FPGAs) is a growing
research area. Using secure practices, third party FPGA designers can be
provided with no knowledge of initial and final classification layers. In this
work, we demonstrate that hardware intrinsic attack (HIA) in such a "secure"
design is still possible. Proposed HIA is inserted inside mathematical
operations of individual layers of CNN, which propagates erroneous operations
in all the subsequent CNN layers that lead to misclassification. The attack is
non-periodic and completely random, hence it becomes difficult to detect. Five
different attack scenarios with respect to each CNN layer are designed and
evaluated based on the overhead resources and the rate of triggering in
comparison to the original implementation. Our results for two CNN
architectures show that in all the attack scenarios, additional latency is
negligible (<0.61%), increment in DSP, LUT, FF is also less than 2.36%. Three
attack scenarios do not require any additional BRAM resources, while in two
scenarios BRAM increases, which compensates with the corresponding decrease in
FF and LUTs. To the authors' best knowledge this work is the first to address
the hardware intrinsic CNN attack with the attacker does not have knowledge of
the full CNN.]]></summary>

derive a conditional moment restriction (CMR) through which we can identify

multiparty dialogue and suggests two new tasks for more comprehensive
predictions of personal entities in daily conversations. We first demonstrate
that there are substantial limitations to the evaluation methods of previous
work, namely that randomized assignment of samples to training and test data
substantially decreases the complexity of cloze-style reading comprehension.
According to our analysis, replacing the random data split with a chronological
data split reduces test accuracy on previous single-variable passage completion
task from 72\% to 34\%, that leaves much more room to improve. Our proposed
tasks extend the previous single-variable passage completion task by replacing
more character mentions with variables. Several deep learning models are
developed to validate these three tasks. A thorough error analysis is provided
to understand the challenges and guide the future direction of this research.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Automatic differentiation (autodiff) has revolutionized machine learning. It
allows expressing complex computations by composing elementary ones in creative
ways and removes the burden of computing their derivatives by hand. More
recently, differentiation of optimization problem solutions has attracted
widespread attention with applications such as optimization as a layer, and in
bi-level problems such as hyper-parameter optimization and meta-learning.
However, the formulas for these derivatives often involve case-by-case tedious
mathematical derivations. In this paper, we propose a unified, efficient and
modular approach for implicit differentiation of optimization problems. In our
approach, the user defines (in Python in the case of our implementation) a
function $F$ capturing the optimality conditions of the problem to be
differentiated. Once this is done, we leverage autodiff of $F$ and implicit
differentiation to automatically differentiate the optimization problem. Our
approach thus combines the benefits of implicit differentiation and autodiff.
It is efficient as it can be added on top of any state-of-the-art solver and
modular as the optimality condition specification is decoupled from the
implicit differentiation mechanism. We show that seemingly simple principles
allow to recover many recently proposed implicit differentiation methods and
create new ones easily. We demonstrate the ease of formulating and solving
bi-level optimization problems using our framework. We also showcase an
application to the sensitivity analysis of molecular dynamics.]]></summary>

(ConvLSTM) networks. Utilizing the expert annotations, model training was
performed 5 times with separate hold-out sets using 5-fold cross-validation to
segment ground-glass opacity and high opacity (including consolidation and
pleural effusion). The performance of the method was evaluated on CT data sets
from 197 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
test result for SARS-CoV-2. Strong agreement between expert manual and
automatic segmentation was obtained for lung lesions with a Dice score
coefficient of 0.876 $\pm$ 0.005; excellent correlations of 0.978 and 0.981 for
ground-glass opacity and high opacity volumes. In the external validation set
of 67 patients, there was dice score coefficient of 0.767 $\pm$ 0.009 as well
as excellent correlations of 0.989 and 0.996 for ground-glass opacity and high

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), AUC maximization and robust estimation,
to mention but a few. A substantial amount of studies are devoted to studying
the convergence behavior of their stochastic gradient-type algorithms. In
contrast, there is relatively little work on their generalization, i.e., how
the learning models built from training examples would behave on test examples.
In this paper, we provide a comprehensive generalization analysis of stochastic
gradient methods for minimax problems under both convex-concave and
nonconvex-nonconcave cases through the lens of algorithmic stability. We
establish a quantitative connection between stability and several
generalization measures both in expectation and with high probability. For the
convex-concave setting, our stability analysis shows that stochastic gradient
descent ascent attains optimal generalization bounds for both smooth and
nonsmooth minimax problems. We also establish generalization bounds for both

of tensors, each of an arbitrary shape, which is often seen in Neural Networks.
Each of the tensors in the set is modeled using Tensor Rings, though the
concept applies to other Tensor Networks. Owing its name to the T-shape of
nodes in diagram notation of Tensor Rings, T-Basis is simply a list of equally
shaped three-dimensional tensors, used to represent Tensor Ring nodes. Such
representation allows us to parameterize the tensor set with a small number of
parameters (coefficients of the T-Basis tensors), scaling logarithmically with
each tensor's size in the set and linearly with the dimensionality of T-Basis.
We evaluate the proposed approach on the task of neural network compression and
demonstrate that it reaches high compression rates at acceptable performance
drops. Finally, we analyze memory and operation requirements of the compressed
networks and conclude that T-Basis networks are equally well suited for
training and inference in resource-constrained environments and usage on the
edge devices.]]></summary>

generative adversarial learning. KDD GAN formulates the training as a
likelihood ratio optimization problem where the data distributions are written
explicitly via (local) Kernel Density Estimates (KDE). This is inspired by the
recent progress in contrastive learning and its relation to KDE. We define the
KDEs directly in feature space and forgo the requirement of invertibility of
the kernel feature mappings. In our approach, features are no longer optimized
for linear separability, as in the original GAN formulation, but for the more
general discrimination of distributions in the feature space. We analyze the
gradient of our loss with respect to the feature representation and show that
it is better behaved than that of the original hinge loss. We perform
experiments with the proposed KDE-based loss, used either as a training loss or
a regularization term, on both CIFAR10 and scaled versions of ImageNet. We use
BigGAN/SA-GAN as a backbone and baseline, since our focus is not to design the
architecture of the networks. We show a boost in the quality of generated
samples with respect to FID from 10% to 40% compared to the baseline. Code will

important for road asset mapping and autonomous driving. In this paper we
present a two-stage framework that detects and geolocalizes traffic signs from
low frame rate street videos. Our proposed system uses a modified version of
RetinaNet (GPS-RetinaNet), which predicts a positional offset for each sign
relative to the camera, in addition to performing the standard classification
and bounding box regression. Candidate sign detections from GPS-RetinaNet are
condensed into geolocalized signs by our custom tracker, which consists of a
learned metric network and a variant of the Hungarian Algorithm. Our metric
network estimates the similarity between pairs of detections, then the
Hungarian Algorithm matches detections across images using the similarity

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We show a connection between sampling and optimization on discrete domains.
For a family of distributions $\mu$ defined on size $k$ subsets of a ground set
of elements that is closed under external fields, we show that rapid mixing of
natural local random walks implies the existence of simple approximation
algorithms to find $\max \mu(\cdot)$. More precisely we show that if
(multi-step) down-up random walks have spectral gap at least inverse
polynomially large in $k$, then (multi-step) local search can find $\max
\mu(\cdot)$ within a factor of $k^{O(k)}$. As the main application of our
result, we show a simple nearly-optimal $k^{O(k)}$-factor approximation
algorithm for MAP inference on nonsymmetric DPPs. This is the first nontrivial
multiplicative approximation for finding the largest size $k$ principal minor
of a square (not-necessarily-symmetric) matrix $L$ with $L+L^\intercal\succeq
0$.

We establish the connection between sampling and optimization by showing that
an exchange inequality, a concept rooted in discrete convex analysis, can be
derived from fast mixing of local random walks. We further connect exchange
inequalities with composable core-sets for optimization, generalizing recent
results on composable core-sets for DPP maximization to arbitrary distributions
that satisfy either the strongly Rayleigh property or that have a log-concave
generating polynomial.]]></summary>

decision-making tools for preventing customer attrition (churn) in customer
relationship management (CRM). Focusing on a CRM dataset with several different
categories of factors that impact customer heterogeneity (i.e., usage of
self-care service channels, duration of service, and responsiveness to
marketing actions), we provide new predictive analytics of customer churn rate
based on a machine learning method that enhances the classification of logistic
regression by adding a mixed penalty term. The proposed penalized logistic
regression can prevent overfitting when dealing with big data and minimize the
loss function when balancing the cost from the median (absolute value) and mean
(squared value) regularization. We show the analytical properties of the
proposed method and its computational advantage in this research. In addition,
we investigate the performance of the proposed method with a CRM data set (that
has a large number of features) under different settings by efficiently
eliminating the disturbance of (1) least important features and (2) sensitivity

on attention encoder-decoder (AED) architectures which tend to suffer from
over-fitting in low resource scenarios. One solution to tackle this issue is to
generate synthetic data with a trained text-to-speech system (TTS) if
additional text is available. This was successfully applied in many
publications with AED systems, but only very limited in the context of other
ASR architectures. We investigate the effect of varying pre-processing, the
speaker embedding and input encoding of the TTS system w.r.t. the effectiveness
of the synthesized data for AED-ASR training. Additionally, we also consider
internal language model subtraction for the first time, resulting in up to 38%
relative improvement. We compare the AED results to a state-of-the-art hybrid
ASR system, a monophone based system using
connectionist-temporal-classification (CTC) and a monotonic transducer based
system. We show that for the later systems the addition of synthetic data has
no relevant effect, but they still outperform the AED systems on
LibriSpeech-100h. We achieve a final word-error-rate of 3.3%/10.0% with a
hybrid system on the clean/noisy test-sets, surpassing any previous

networks (CNN) can represent incredibly complex nonlinear functions which map
between combinations of images and scalars. For example, CNNs can be used to
map combinations of accelerator parameters and images which are 2D projections
of the 6D phase space distributions of charged particle beams as they are
transported between various particle accelerator locations. Despite their
strengths, applying ML to time-varying systems, or systems with shifting
distributions, is an open problem, especially for large systems for which
collecting new data for re-training is impractical or interrupts operations.
Particle accelerators are one example of large time-varying systems for which
collecting detailed training data requires lengthy dedicated beam measurements
which may no longer be available during regular operations. We present a
recently developed method of adaptive ML for time-varying systems. Our approach
is to map very high (N>100k) dimensional inputs (a combination of scalar
parameters and images) into the low dimensional (N~2) latent space at the
output of the encoder section of an encoder-decoder CNN. We then actively tune
the low dimensional latent space-based representation of complex system
dynamics by the addition of an adaptively tuned feedback vector directly before
the decoder sections builds back up to our image-based high-dimensional phase
space density representations. This method allows us to learn correlations
within and to quickly tune the characteristics of incredibly high parameter
systems and to track their evolution in real time based on feedback without
massive new data sets for re-training.]]></summary>

Our approach was based on training machine learning models on the surveys' data
to predict grade retention between 2012 and 2017 using information from 2012 or

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Machine Learning algorithms often prompt individuals to strategically modify
their observable attributes to receive more favorable predictions. As a result,
the distribution the predictive model is trained on may differ from the one it
operates on in deployment. While such distribution shifts, in general, hinder
accurate predictions, our work identifies a unique opportunity associated with
shifts due to strategic responses: We show that we can use strategic responses
effectively to recover causal relationships between the observable features and
outcomes we wish to predict. More specifically, we study a game-theoretic model
in which a principal deploys a sequence of models to predict an outcome of
interest (e.g., college GPA) for a sequence of strategic agents (e.g., college
applicants). In response, strategic agents invest efforts and modify their
features for better predictions. In such settings, unobserved confounding
variables can influence both an agent's observable features (e.g., high school
records) and outcomes. Therefore, standard regression methods generally produce
biased estimators. In order to address this issue, our work establishes a novel
connection between strategic responses to machine learning models and
instrumental variable (IV) regression, by observing that the sequence of
deployed models can be viewed as an instrument that affects agents' observable
features but does not directly influence their outcomes. Therefore, two-stage
least squares (2SLS) regression can recover the causal relationships between
observable features and outcomes. Beyond causal recovery, we can build on our
2SLS method to address two additional relevant optimization objectives: agent
outcome maximization and predictive risk minimization. Finally, our numerical
simulations on semi-synthetic data show that our methods significantly
outperform OLS regression in causal relationship estimation.]]></summary>

(CRMAB). The constraints are in the form of time varying set of actions (set of
available arms). This variation can be either stochastic or semi-deterministic.
Given a set of arms, a fixed number of them can be chosen to be played in each
decision interval. The play of each arm yields a state dependent reward. The
current states of arms are partially observable through binary feedback signals
from arms that are played. The current availability of arms is fully
observable. The objective is to maximize long term cumulative reward. The
uncertainty about future availability of arms along with partial state
information makes this objective challenging. Applications for CRMAB abound in
the domain of cyber-physical systems. First, this optimization problem is
analyzed using Whittle's index policy. To this end, a constrained restless
single-armed bandit is studied. It is shown to admit a threshold-type optimal
policy and is also indexable. An algorithm to compute Whittle's index is
presented. An alternate solution method with lower complexity is also presented
in the form of an online rollout policy. Further, upper bounds on the value

various solutions. The simulation study compares the performance of Whittle's

distribution and have proved to be powerful models for data generation and
density estimation. In this work, we propose a novel type of normalizing flow
driven by a differential deformation of the Wiener process. As a result, we
obtain a rich time series model whose observable process inherits many of the
appealing properties of its base process, such as efficient computation of
likelihoods and marginals. Furthermore, our continuous treatment provides a
natural framework for irregular time series with an independent arrival
process, including straightforward interpolation. We illustrate the desirable
properties of the proposed model on popular stochastic processes and
demonstrate its superior flexibility to variational RNN and latent ODE
baselines in a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world data.]]></summary>

resource-limited IoT devices such as smart sensors, which realizes standalone
online adaptation for streaming data without data transfers to remote servers.
OS-ELM (Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine) has been one of promising
neural-network-based online algorithms for on-chip learning because it can
perform online training at low computational cost and is easy to implement as a
digital circuit. Existing OS-ELM digital circuits employ fixed-point data
format and the bit-widths are often manually tuned, however, this may cause
overflow or underflow which can lead to unexpected behavior of the circuit. For
on-chip learning systems, an overflow/underflow-free design has a great impact
since online training is continuously performed and the intervals of
intermediate variables will dynamically change as time goes by. In this paper,
we propose an overflow/underflow-free bit-width optimization method for
fixed-point digital circuits of OS-ELM. Experimental results show that our
method realizes overflow/underflow-free OS-ELM digital circuits with 1.0x -
1.5x more area cost compared to the baseline simulation method where overflow

learning (RL) systems in the real world. In this paper, we show that the
sequential structure of the RL problem necessitates new approaches to
generalization beyond the well-studied techniques used in supervised learning.
While supervised learning methods can generalize effectively without explicitly
accounting for epistemic uncertainty, we show that, perhaps surprisingly, this
is not the case in RL. We show that generalization to unseen test conditions
from a limited number of training conditions induces implicit partial
observability, effectively turning even fully-observed MDPs into POMDPs.
Informed by this observation, we recast the problem of generalization in RL as
solving the induced partially observed Markov decision process, which we call
the epistemic POMDP. We demonstrate the failure modes of algorithms that do not
appropriately handle this partial observability, and suggest a simple
ensemble-based technique for approximately solving the partially observed
problem. Empirically, we demonstrate that our simple algorithm derived from the
epistemic POMDP achieves significant gains in generalization over current
methods on the Procgen benchmark suite.]]></summary>

time, it is through discrete time mappings that much of the understanding of
chaos is formed. Henri Poincar\'e first made this connection by tracking
consecutive iterations of the continuous flow with a lower-dimensional,
transverse subspace. The mapping that iterates the dynamics through consecutive
intersections of the flow with the subspace is now referred to as a Poincar\'e
map, and it is the primary method available for interpreting and classifying
chaotic dynamics. Unfortunately, in all but the simplest systems, an explicit
form for such a mapping remains outstanding. This work proposes a method for
obtaining explicit Poincar\'e mappings by using deep learning to construct an
invertible coordinate transformation into a conjugate representation where the
dynamics are governed by a relatively simple chaotic mapping. The invertible
change of variable is based on an autoencoder, which allows for dimensionality
reduction, and has the advantage of classifying chaotic systems using the
equivalence relation of topological conjugacies. Indeed, the enforcement of
topological conjugacies is the critical neural network regularization for
learning the coordinate and dynamics pairing. We provide expository
applications of the method to low-dimensional systems such as the R\"ossler and
Lorenz systems, while also demonstrating the utility of the method on
infinite-dimensional systems, such as the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation.]]></summary>

$(\beta,\gamma)$-convexity, we can translate natural density properties of
clusters (which include, for instance, clusters that are strongly non-convex in
$\mathbb{R}^d$) into a graph-theoretic notion of convexity. By exploiting this
convexity notion, we design a deterministic algorithm that recovers
$(\beta,\gamma)$-convex clusters using $O(k^2 \log n + k^2
(6/\beta\gamma)^{dens(X)})$ same-cluster queries, where $k$ is the number of
clusters and $dens(X)$ is the density dimension of the semimetric. We show that
an exponential dependence on the density dimension is necessary, and we also
show that, if we are allowed to make $O(k^2 + k\log n)$ additional queries to a
"cluster separation" oracle, then we can recover clusters that have different
and arbitrary scales, even when the scale of each cluster is unknown.]]></summary>

time by assigning zones -- fixed pitch ranges of the keyboard -- to different
instruments. In this paper, we aim to further extend this idea and examine the
feasibility of automatic instrumentation -- dynamically assigning instruments
to notes in solo music during performance. In addition to the online,
real-time-capable setting for performative use cases, automatic instrumentation
can also find applications in assistive composing tools in an offline setting.
Due to the lack of paired data of original solo music and their full
arrangements, we approach automatic instrumentation by learning to separate
parts (e.g., voices, instruments and tracks) from their mixture in symbolic
multitrack music, assuming that the mixture is to be played on a keyboard. We
frame the task of part separation as a sequential multi-class classification
problem and adopt machine learning to map sequences of notes into sequences of
part labels. To examine the effectiveness of our proposed models, we conduct a
comprehensive empirical evaluation over four diverse datasets of different
genres and ensembles -- Bach chorales, string quartets, game music and pop
music. Our experiments show that the proposed models outperform various
baselines. We also demonstrate the potential for our proposed models to produce
alternative convincing instrumentations for an existing arrangement by
separating its mixture into parts. All source code and audio samples can be

nonlinear dynamical models for applications in machine learning, system
identification and control. The new model class has ``built in'' guarantees of
stability and robustness: all models in the class are contracting - a strong
form of nonlinear stability - and models can satisfy prescribed incremental
integral quadratic constraints (IQC), including Lipschitz bounds and
incremental passivity. RENs are otherwise very flexible: they can represent all
stable linear systems, all previously-known sets of contracting recurrent
neural networks and echo state networks, all deep feedforward neural networks,
and all stable Wiener/Hammerstein models. RENs are parameterized directly by a
vector in R^N, i.e. stability and robustness are ensured without parameter
constraints, which simplifies learning since generic methods for unconstrained
optimization can be used. The performance and robustness of the new model set
is evaluated on benchmark nonlinear system identification problems, and the
paper also presents applications in data-driven nonlinear observer design and
control with stability guarantees.]]></summary>

backdoored model will misclassify the trigger-embedded inputs into an
attacker-chosen target label while performing normally on other benign inputs.
There are already numerous works on backdoor attacks on neural networks, but
only a few works consider graph neural networks (GNNs). As such, there is no
intensive research on explaining the impact of trigger injecting position on
the performance of backdoor attacks on GNNs.

To bridge this gap, we conduct an experimental investigation on the
performance of backdoor attacks on GNNs. We apply two powerful GNN
explainability approaches to select the optimal trigger injecting position to
achieve two attacker objectives -- high attack success rate and low clean
accuracy drop. Our empirical results on benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art
neural network models demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in
selecting trigger injecting position for backdoor attacks on GNNs. For
instance, on the node classification task, the backdoor attack with trigger
injecting position selected by GraphLIME reaches over $84 \%$ attack success
rate with less than $2.5 \%$ accuracy drop]]></summary>

parametric human mesh to images of obese people. Despite obese person mesh
fitting being an important problem with numerous applications (e.g.,
healthcare), much recent progress in mesh recovery has been restricted to
images of non-obese people. In this work, we identify this crucial gap in the
current literature by presenting and discussing limitations of existing
algorithms. Next, we present a simple baseline to address this problem that is
scalable and can be easily used in conjunction with existing algorithms to
improve their performance. Finally, we present a generalized human mesh
optimization algorithm that substantially improves the performance of existing
methods on both obese person images as well as community-standard benchmark
datasets. A key innovation of this technique is that it does not rely on
supervision from expensive-to-create mesh parameters. Instead, starting from
widely and cheaply available 2D keypoints annotations, our method automatically
generates mesh parameters that can in turn be used to re-train and fine-tune
any existing mesh estimation algorithm. This way, we show our method acts as a
drop-in to improve the performance of a wide variety of contemporary mesh

beta-VAE framework to sort out the importance of the generative factors,
providing more insights for non-linear system analysis. These qualities will

biomedical data. In particular, DNNs have been used to seamlessly fuse
heterogeneous information from neuroanatomy, genetics, biomarkers, and
neuropsychological tests for highly accurate Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. On
the other hand, their black-box nature is still a barrier for the adoption of
such a system in the clinic, where interpretability is absolutely essential. We
propose Shapley Value Explanation of Heterogeneous Neural Networks (SVEHNN) for
explaining the Alzheimer's diagnosis made by a DNN from the 3D point cloud of
the neuroanatomy and tabular biomarkers. Our explanations are based on the
Shapley value, which is the unique method that satisfies all fundamental axioms
for local explanations previously established in the literature. Thus, SVEHNN
has many desirable characteristics that previous work on interpretability for
medical decision making is lacking. To avoid the exponential time complexity of
the Shapley value, we propose to transform a given DNN into a Lightweight
Probabilistic Deep Network without re-training, thus achieving a complexity
only quadratic in the number of features. In our experiments on synthetic and
real data, we show that we can closely approximate the exact Shapley value with
a dramatically reduced runtime and can reveal the hidden knowledge the network
has learned from the data.]]></summary>

multi-parameter Bayesian frameworks, such knowledge is incorporated as a prior.
On the other hand, various model parameters can have different learning rates
in real-world problems, especially with skewed data. Two often-faced challenges
in Operation Management and Management Science applications are the absence of
informative priors, and the inability to control parameter learning rates. In
this study, we propose a hierarchical Empirical Bayes approach that addresses
both challenges, and that can generalize to any Bayesian framework. Our method
learns empirical meta-priors from the data itself and uses them to decouple the
learning rates of first-order and second-order features (or any other given
feature grouping) in a Generalized Linear Model. As the first-order features
are likely to have a more pronounced effect on the outcome, focusing on
learning first-order weights first is likely to improve performance and
convergence time. Our Empirical Bayes method clamps features in each group
together and uses the deployed model's observed data to empirically compute a
hierarchical prior in hindsight. We report theoretical results for the
unbiasedness, strong consistency, and optimal frequentist cumulative regret
properties of our meta-prior variance estimator. We apply our method to a
standard supervised learning optimization problem, as well as an online
combinatorial optimization problem in a contextual bandit setting implemented
in an Amazon production system. Both during simulations and live experiments,
our method shows marked improvements, especially in cases of small traffic. Our
findings are promising, as optimizing over sparse data is often a challenge.]]></summary>

turn a deep neural net into a fast, powerful heuristic solver of NP-hard
problems. This approach has a great potential in practical applications because
it allows near-optimal solutions to be found without expert guides armed with
substantial domain knowledge. We introduce Policy Optimization with Multiple
Optima (POMO), an end-to-end approach for building such a heuristic solver.
POMO is applicable to a wide range of CO problems. It is designed to exploit
the symmetries in the representation of a CO solution. POMO uses a modified
REINFORCE algorithm that forces diverse rollouts towards all optimal solutions.
Empirically, the low-variance baseline of POMO makes RL training fast and
stable, and it is more resistant to local minima compared to previous
approaches. We also introduce a new augmentation-based inference method, which
accompanies POMO nicely. We demonstrate the effectiveness of POMO by solving
three popular NP-hard problems, namely, traveling salesman (TSP), capacitated
vehicle routing (CVRP), and 0-1 knapsack (KP). For all three, our solver based
on POMO shows a significant improvement in performance over all recent learned
heuristics. In particular, we achieve the optimality gap of 0.14% with TSP100
while reducing inference time by more than an order of magnitude.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modern policy gradient algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
rely on an arsenal of heuristics, including loss clipping and gradient
clipping, to ensure successful learning. These heuristics are reminiscent of
techniques from robust statistics, commonly used for estimation in outlier-rich
(``heavy-tailed'') regimes. In this paper, we present a detailed empirical
study to characterize the heavy-tailed nature of the gradients of the PPO
surrogate reward function. We demonstrate that the gradients, especially for
the actor network, exhibit pronounced heavy-tailedness and that it increases as
the agent's policy diverges from the behavioral policy (i.e., as the agent goes
further off policy). Further examination implicates the likelihood ratios and
advantages in the surrogate reward as the main sources of the observed
heavy-tailedness. We then highlight issues arising due to the heavy-tailed
nature of the gradients. In this light, we study the effects of the standard
PPO clipping heuristics, demonstrating that these tricks primarily serve to
offset heavy-tailedness in gradients. Thus motivated, we propose incorporating
GMOM, a high-dimensional robust estimator, into PPO as a substitute for three
clipping tricks. Despite requiring less hyperparameter tuning, our method
matches the performance of PPO (with all heuristics enabled) on a battery of
MuJoCo continuous control tasks.]]></summary>

designed to interact with users during a certain activity, such as browsing,
chatting, socializing, emailing, driving, etc. The economic and incentive
structure of this exchange, as well as its algorithmic nature, have not been
explored to our knowledge. We model this interaction as a Stackelberg game
between a Designer and one or more Agents. We model an Agent as a Markov chain
whose states are activities; we assume that the Agent's utility is a linear
function of the steady-state distribution of this chain. The Designer may
design a platform for each of these activities/states; if a platform is adopted
by the Agent, the transition probabilities of the Markov chain are affected,
and so is the objective of the Agent. The Designer's utility is a linear
function of the steady state probabilities of the accessible states minus the
development cost of the platforms. The underlying optimization problem of the
Agent -- how to choose the states for which to adopt the platform -- is an MDP.
If this MDP has a simple yet plausible structure (the transition probabilities
from one state to another only depend on the target state and the recurrent
probability of the current state) the Agent's problem can be solved by a greedy
algorithm. The Designer's optimization problem (designing a custom suite for
the Agent so as to optimize, through the Agent's optimum reaction, the
Designer's revenue), is NP-hard to approximate within any finite ratio;
however, the special case, while still NP-hard, has an FPTAS. These results
generalize from a single Agent to a distribution of Agents with finite support,
as well as to the setting where the Designer must find the best response to the
existing strategies of other Designers. We discuss other implications of our
results and directions of future research.]]></summary>

This begs the question of what are these audio transformer models learning.
Moreover, although the standard methodology is to choose the last layer

answer these questions for the two recent audio transformer models, Mockingjay
and wave2vec2.0. We compare them on a comprehensive set of language delivery

Additionally, we probe the audio models' understanding of textual surface,

availability of large amounts of labeled brain imaging data, but such data are
scarce and expensive to generate. While powerful data generation mechanisms,
such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have been designed in the last
decade for computer vision, such improvements have not yet carried over to
brain imaging. A likely reason is that GANs training is ill-suited to the
noisy, high-dimensional and small-sample data available in functional
neuroimaging.In this paper, we introduce Conditional Independent Components
Analysis (Conditional ICA): a fast functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
data augmentation technique, that leverages abundant resting-state data to
create images by sampling from an ICA decomposition. We then propose a
mechanism to condition the generator on classes observed with few samples. We
first show that the generative mechanism is successful at synthesizing data
indistinguishable from observations, and that it yields gains in classification
accuracy in brain decoding problems. In particular it outperforms GANs while
being much easier to optimize and interpret. Lastly, Conditional ICA enhances
classification accuracy in eight datasets without further parameters tuning.]]></summary>

ability of a learning algorithm. Among different notions of stability,
\emph{uniform stability} is arguably the most popular one, which yields
exponential generalization bounds. However, uniform stability only considers
the worst-case loss change (or so-called sensitivity) by removing a single data
point, which is distribution-independent and therefore undesirable. There are
many cases that the worst-case sensitivity of the loss is much larger than the
average sensitivity taken over the single data point that is removed,
especially in some advanced models such as random feature models or neural
networks. Many previous works try to mitigate the distribution independent
issue by proposing weaker notions of stability, however, they either only yield
polynomial bounds or the bounds derived do not vanish as sample size goes to
infinity. Given that, we propose \emph{locally elastic stability} as a weaker
and distribution-dependent stability notion, which still yields exponential
generalization bounds. We further demonstrate that locally elastic stability
implies tighter generalization bounds than those derived based on uniform
stability in many situations by revisiting the examples of bounded support
vector machines, regularized least square regressions, and stochastic gradient
descent.]]></summary>

distributions are the same. To this end, a key requirement is to develop models
that can generalize to unseen distributions. Domain generalization (DG), i.e.,
out-of-distribution generalization, has attracted increasing interests in
recent years. Domain generalization deals with a challenging setting where one
or several different but related domain(s) are given, and the goal is to learn
a model that can generalize to an unseen test domain. Great progress has been
made in the area of domain generalization for years. This paper presents the
first review of recent advances in this area. First, we provide a formal
definition of domain generalization and discuss several related fields. We then
thoroughly review the theories related to domain generalization and carefully
analyze the theory behind generalization. We categorize recent algorithms into
three classes: data manipulation, representation learning, and learning
strategy, and present several popular algorithms in detail for each category.
Third, we introduce the commonly used datasets and applications. Finally, we
summarize existing literature and present some potential research topics for
the future.]]></summary>

kernel ridge regression estimates. Unfortunately, when the response variable is
highly skewed, the divide-and-conquer kernel ridge regression (dacKRR) may
overlook the underrepresented region and result in unacceptable results. We
develop a novel response-adaptive partition strategy to overcome the
limitation. In particular, we propose to allocate the replicates of some
carefully identified informative observations to multiple nodes (local
processors). The idea is analogous to the popular oversampling technique.
Although such a technique has been widely used for addressing discrete label
skewness, extending it to the dacKRR setting is nontrivial. We provide both
theoretical and practical guidance on how to effectively over-sample the
observations under the dacKRR setting. Furthermore, we show the proposed
estimate has a smaller asymptotic mean squared error (AMSE) than that of the
classical dacKRR estimate under mild conditions. Our theoretical findings are

making (e.g., loan approvals), there has been growing interest in post hoc
techniques which provide recourse to affected individuals. These techniques
generate recourses under the assumption that the underlying predictive model
does not change. However, in practice, models are often regularly updated for a
variety of reasons (e.g., dataset shifts), thereby rendering previously
prescribed recourses ineffective. To address this problem, we propose a novel
framework, RObust Algorithmic Recourse (ROAR), that leverages adversarial
training for finding recourses that are robust to model shifts. To the best of
our knowledge, this work proposes the first solution to this critical problem.
We also carry out detailed theoretical analysis which underscores the
importance of constructing recourses that are robust to model shifts: 1) we
derive a lower bound on the probability of invalidation of recourses generated
by existing approaches which are not robust to model shifts. 2) we prove that
the additional cost incurred due to the robust recourses output by our
framework is bounded. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthetic and

purely from observational data. A key challenge is how to ensure the learned
policy is safe, which requires quantifying the risk associated with different
actions. In the online setting, distributional RL algorithms do so by learning
the distribution over returns (i.e., cumulative rewards) instead of the
expected return; beyond quantifying risk, they have also been shown to learn
better representations for planning. We propose Conservative Offline
Distributional Actor Critic (CODAC), an offline RL algorithm suitable for both
risk-neutral and risk-averse domains. CODAC adapts distributional RL to the
offline setting by penalizing the predicted quantiles of the return for
out-of-distribution actions. We prove that CODAC learns a conservative return
distribution -- in particular, for finite MDPs, CODAC converges to an uniform
lower bound on the quantiles of the return distribution; our proof relies on a
novel analysis of the distributional Bellman operator. In our experiments, on
two challenging robot navigation tasks, CODAC successfully learns risk-averse
policies using offline data collected purely from risk-neutral agents.
Furthermore, CODAC is state-of-the-art on the D4RL MuJoCo benchmark in terms of
both expected and risk-sensitive performance.]]></summary>

of machine learning such as decision making, it is therefore very difficult to
establish clear and direct objectives for training representation learning
models. It has been argued that a good representation should disentangle the
underlying variation factors, yet how to translate this into training
objectives remains unknown. This paper presents an attempt to establish direct
training criterions and design principles for developing good representation
learning models. We propose that a good representation learning model should be
maximally expressive, i.e., capable of distinguishing the maximum number of
input configurations. We formally define expressiveness and introduce the
maximum expressiveness (MEXS) theorem of a general learning model. We propose
to train a model by maximizing its expressiveness while at the same time
incorporating general priors such as model smoothness. We present a conscience
competitive learning algorithm which encourages the model to reach its MEXS
whilst at the same time adheres to model smoothness prior. We also introduce a
label consistent training (LCT) technique to boost model smoothness by
encouraging it to assign consistent labels to similar samples. We present
extensive experimental results to show that our method can indeed design
representation learning models capable of developing representations that are
as good as or better than state of the art. We also show that our technique is
computationally efficient, robust against different parameter settings and can
work effectively on a variety of datasets.]]></summary>

convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide the current state of the art in
denoising natural images, where they produce impressive results. However, their
potential has barely been explored in the context of scientific imaging.
Denoising CNNs are typically trained on real natural images artificially
corrupted with simulated noise. In contrast, in scientific applications,
noiseless ground-truth images are usually not available. To address this issue,
we propose a simulation-based denoising (SBD) framework, in which CNNs are
trained on simulated images. We test the framework on data obtained from
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), an imaging technique with widespread
applications in material science, biology, and medicine. SBD outperforms
existing techniques by a wide margin on a simulated benchmark dataset, as well
as on real data. Apart from the denoised images, SBD generates likelihood maps
to visualize the agreement between the structure of the denoised image and the
observed data. Our results reveal shortcomings of state-of-the-art denoising
architectures, such as their small field-of-view: substantially increasing the
field-of-view of the CNNs allows them to exploit non-local periodic patterns in
the data, which is crucial at high noise levels. In addition, we analyze the
generalization capability of SBD, demonstrating that the trained networks are
robust to variations of imaging parameters and of the underlying signal
structure. Finally, we release the first publicly available benchmark dataset
of TEM images, containing 18,000 examples.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Autoencoders and generative neural network models have recently gained
popularity in fluid mechanics due to their spontaneity and low processing time
instead of high fidelity CFD simulations. Auto encoders are used as model order
reduction tools in applications of fluid mechanics by compressing input
high-dimensional data using an encoder to map the input space into a
lower-dimensional latent space. Whereas, generative models such as Variational
Auto-encoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are proving to
be effective in generating solutions to chaotic models with high 'randomness'
such as turbulent flows. In this study, forced isotropic turbulence flow is
generated by parameterizing into some basic statistical characteristics. The
models trained on pre-simulated data from dependencies on these characteristics
and the flow generation is then affected by varying these parameters. The
latent vectors pushed along the generator models like the decoders and
generators contain independent entries which can be used to create different
outputs with similar properties. The use of neural network-based architecture
removes the need for dependency on the classical mesh-based Navier-Stoke
equation estimation which is prominent in many CFD softwares.]]></summary>

led to an outburst in the amount of data stored digitally. Consequently,
several retrieval systems have been developed depending on the type of data
stored in these databases. However, unlike text data or images, performing a
search for 3D models is non-trivial. Among 3D models, retrieving 3D
Engineering/CAD models or mechanical components is even more challenging due to
the presence of holes, volumetric features, presence of sharp edges etc., which
make CAD a domain unto itself. The research work presented in this paper aims
at developing a dataset suitable for building a retrieval system for 3D CAD
models based on deep learning. 3D CAD models from the available CAD databases
are collected, and a dataset of computer-generated sketch data, termed
'CADSketchNet', has been prepared. Additionally, hand-drawn sketches of the
components are also added to CADSketchNet. Using the sketch images from this
dataset, the paper also aims at evaluating the performance of various retrieval
system or a search engine for 3D CAD models that accepts a sketch image as the
input query. Many experimental models are constructed and tested on
CADSketchNet. These experiments, along with the model architecture, choice of
similarity metrics are reported along with the search results.]]></summary>

contributors to global warming. Renewable energy sources are a viable
alternative to produce electrical energy and to reduce the emission from the
power industry. These energy sources are the building blocks of green energy,
which all have different characteristics. Their availabilities are also
diverse, depending on geographical locations and other parameters. Low
implementation cost and distributed availability all over the world uplifts
their popularity exponentially. Therefore, it has unlocked opportunities for
consumers to produce electricity locally and use it on-site, which reduces
dependency on centralized utility companies. The research considers two main
objectives: the prediction of wind speed that simplifies wind farm planning and
feasibility study. Secondly, the need to understand the dependency structure of
the wind speeds of multiple distant locations. To address the first objective,
twelve artificial intelligence algorithms were used for wind speed prediction
from collected meteorological parameters. The model performances were compared
to determine the wind speed prediction accuracy. The results show a deep
learning approach, long short-term memory (LSTM) outperforms other models with
the highest accuracy of 97.8%. For dependency, a multivariate cumulative
distribution function, Copula, was used to find the joint distribution of two
or more distant location wind speeds, followed by a case study. We found that
the appropriate copula family and the parameters vary based on the distance in
between. For the case study, Joe-Frank (BB8) copula shows an efficient joint
distribution fit for a wind speed pair with a standard error of 0.0094.
Finally, some insights about the uncertainty aspects of wind speed dependency
were addressed.]]></summary>

computer vision, this has not yet been the case for behavioral modeling and
behavioral health applications. This is because the domain's datasets are
smaller, have heterogeneous datatypes, and typically exhibit a large degree of
missingness. Therefore, off-the-shelf deep learning models require significant,
often prohibitive, adaptation. Accordingly, many research applications still
rely on manually coded features with boosted tree models, sometimes with
task-specific features handcrafted by experts. Here, we address these
challenges by providing a neural architecture framework for mobile sensing data
that can learn generalizable feature representations from time series and
demonstrates the feasibility of transfer learning on small data domains through
finetuning. This architecture combines benefits from CNN and Trans-former
architectures to (1) enable better prediction performance by learning directly
from raw minute-level sensor data without the need for handcrafted features by
up to 0.33 ROC AUC, and (2) use pretraining to outperform simpler neural models

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anomaly Detection is an unsupervised learning task aimed at detecting
anomalous behaviours with respect to historical data. In particular,
multivariate Anomaly Detection has an important role in many applications
thanks to the capability of summarizing the status of a complex system or
observed phenomenon with a single indicator (typically called `Anomaly Score')
and thanks to the unsupervised nature of the task that does not require human
tagging. The Isolation Forest is one of the most commonly adopted algorithms in
the field of Anomaly Detection, due to its proven effectiveness and low
computational complexity. A major problem affecting Isolation Forest is
represented by the lack of interpretability, an effect of the inherent
randomness governing the splits performed by the Isolation Trees, the building
blocks of the Isolation Forest. In this paper we propose effective, yet
computationally inexpensive, methods to define feature importance scores at
both global and local level for the Isolation Forest. Moreover, we define a
procedure to perform unsupervised feature selection for Anomaly Detection
problems based on our interpretability method; such procedure also serves the
purpose of tackling the challenging task of feature importance evaluation in
unsupervised anomaly detection. We assess the performance on several synthetic
and real-world datasets, including comparisons against state-of-the-art
interpretability techniques, and make the code publicly available to enhance
reproducibility and foster research in the field.]]></summary>

Optimization (CPPO) which leverages a general function class and uses a

model belongs to our function class, CPPO can learn with the offline data only
providing partial coverage, i.e., it can learn a policy that completes against
any policy that is covered by the offline data, in polynomial sample complexity
with respect to the statistical complexity of the function class. We then
demonstrate that this algorithmic framework can be applied to many specialized
Markov Decision Processes where the additional structural assumptions can
further refine the concept of partial coverage. One notable example is low-rank
MDP with representation learning where the partial coverage is defined using
the concept of relative condition number measured by the underlying unknown
ground truth feature representation. Finally, we introduce and study the
Bayesian setting in offline RL. The key benefit of Bayesian offline RL is that
algorithmically, we do not need to explicitly construct pessimism or reward
penalty which could be hard beyond models with linear structures. We present a
posterior sampling-based incremental policy optimization algorithm (PS-PO)
which proceeds by iteratively sampling a model from the posterior distribution

this problem forms the basis of our approach, which we call Model-Based Domain
Generalization. Due to the inherent challenges in solving constrained
optimization problems in deep learning, we exploit nonconvex duality theory to
develop unconstrained relaxations of this statistical problem with tight bounds
on the duality gap. Based on this theoretical motivation, we propose a novel
domain generalization algorithm with convergence guarantees. In our
experiments, we report improvements of up to 30 percentage points over
state-of-the-art domain generalization baselines on several benchmarks
including ColoredMNIST, Camelyon17-WILDS, FMoW-WILDS, and PACS.]]></summary>

ii) a holiday adjustment procedure, iii) training of individual forecasting
models, iv) forecast combination by smoothed Bernstein Online Aggregation
(BOA). The approach is flexible and can quickly adopt to new energy system
situations as they occurred during and after COVID-19 shutdowns. The pool of
individual prediction models ranges from rather simple time series models to
sophisticated models like generalized additive models (GAMs) and
high-dimensional linear models estimated by lasso. They incorporate
autoregressive, calendar and weather effects efficiently. All steps contain
novel concepts that contribute to the excellent forecasting performance of the

conditionally independent of the outcome, play an important role in causal
inference with unobserved confounders. However, the existing IV-based
counterfactual prediction methods need well-predefined IVs, while it's an art
rather than science to find valid IVs in many real-world scenes. Moreover, the
predefined hand-made IVs could be weak or erroneous by violating the conditions
of valid IVs. These thorny facts hinder the application of the IV-based
counterfactual prediction methods. In this paper, we propose a novel Automatic
Instrumental Variable decomposition (AutoIV) algorithm to automatically
generate representations serving the role of IVs from observed variables (IV
candidates). Specifically, we let the learned IV representations satisfy the
relevance condition with the treatment and exclusion condition with the outcome
via mutual information maximization and minimization constraints, respectively.
We also learn confounder representations by encouraging them to be relevant to
both the treatment and the outcome. The IV and confounder representations
compete for the information with their constraints in an adversarial game,
which allows us to get valid IV representations for IV-based counterfactual
prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates valid
IV representations for accurate IV-based counterfactual prediction.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Machine Learning (ML) is of a great importance to society due to the
availability of huge data and high computational resources. This ultimately led
to the introduction of ML concepts at multiple levels of education including
K-12 students to promote computational thinking. However, teaching these
concepts to K-12 through traditional methodologies such as video lectures and
books is challenging. Many studies in the literature have reported that using
interactive environments such as games to teach computational thinking and
programming improves retention capacity and motivation among students.
Therefore, introducing ML concepts using a game might enhance students'
understanding of the subject and motivate them to learn further. However, we
are not aware of any existing game which explicitly focuses on introducing ML
concepts to students using game play. Hence, in this paper, we propose
ML-Quest, a 3D video game to provide conceptual overview of three ML concepts:
Supervised Learning, Gradient Descent and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
Classification. The crux of the game is to introduce the definition and working
of these concepts, which we call conceptual overview, in a simulated scenario
without overwhelming students with the intricacies of ML. The game has been
predominantly evaluated for its usefulness and player experience using the
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) model with the help of 23 higher-secondary
school students. The survey result shows that around 70% of the participants
either agree or strongly agree that the ML-Quest is quite interactive and
useful in introducing them to ML concepts.]]></summary>

Doubly-reparameterized gradients (DReGs) improve on the RT for multi-sample

additional reduction in variance. Here, we develop two generalizations of the
DReGs estimator and show that they can be used to train conditional and
hierarchical VAEs on image modelling tasks more effectively. First, we extend
the estimator to hierarchical models with several stochastic layers by showing
how to treat additional score function terms due to the hierarchical
variational posterior. We then generalize DReGs to score functions of arbitrary
distributions instead of just those of the sampling distribution, which makes
the estimator applicable to the parameters of the prior in addition to those of
the posterior.]]></summary>

determine the most accurate peak load-forecasting model for Korea, by comparing
the performance of time series, machine learning, and hybrid models. Seasonal
autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous variables (SARIMAX) is
used for the time series model. Artificial neural network (ANN), support vector

learning models. SARIMAX-ANN, SARIMAX-SVR, and SARIMAX-LSTM are used for the
hybrid models. The results indicate that the hybrid models exhibit significant
improvement over the SARIMAX model. The LSTM-based models outperformed the
others; the single and hybrid LSTM models did not exhibit a significant
performance difference. In the case of Korea's highest peak load in 2019, the
predictive power of the LSTM model proved to be greater than that of the
SARIMAX-LSTM model. The LSTM, SARIMAX-SVR, and SARIMAX-LSTM models outperformed

(via Double DQN) and transfer learning. The motivation behind is that Double
Q-learning can alleviate the problem of overestimation of the action values
present in conventional Q-learning, while transfer learning can leverage
knowledge acquired by an expert model to accelerate learning in the MARL
setting. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in a realistic V2X setting, with
synthetic data generated based on a geometry-based propagation model that

loss where we have to sample data carefully, in out method, we can generate
triplets using the whole dataset, and the optimization can still converge
without frequently running into a model collapsing issue. The adaptive margins
only need to be computed once before the training, which is much less expensive
than generating triplets after every epoch as in the fixed margin case. Besides

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) when being trained to generate images.
To perform real image editing, it requires an accurate mapping from the real
image to the latent space to leveraging these learned semantics, which is
important yet difficult. An in-domain GAN inversion approach is recently
proposed to constraint the inverted code within the latent space by forcing the
reconstructed image obtained from the inverted code within the real image
space. Empirically, we find that the inverted code by the in-domain GAN can
deviate from the latent space significantly. To solve this problem, we propose
a force-in-domain GAN based on the in-domain GAN, which utilizes a
discriminator to force the inverted code within the latent space. The
force-in-domain GAN can also be interpreted by a cycle-GAN with slight
modification. Extensive experiments show that our force-in-domain GAN not only
reconstructs the target image at the pixel level, but also align the inverted
code with the latent space well for semantic editing.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper is both an introduction and an invitation. It is an introduction
to CARLE, a Life-like cellular automata simulator and reinforcement learning
environment. It is also an invitation to Carle's Game, a challenge in
open-ended machine exploration and creativity. Inducing machine agents to excel
at creating interesting patterns across multiple cellular automata universes is
a substantial challenge, and approaching this challenge is likely to require
contributions from the fields of artificial life, AI, machine learning, and
complexity, at multiple levels of interest. Carle's Game is based on machine
agent interaction with CARLE, a Cellular Automata Reinforcement Learning
Environment. CARLE is flexible, capable of simulating any of the 262,144
different rules defining Life-like cellular automaton universes. CARLE is also
fast and can simulate automata universes at a rate of tens of thousands of
steps per second through a combination of vectorization and GPU acceleration.
Finally, CARLE is simple. Compared to high-fidelity physics simulators and
video games designed for human players, CARLE's two-dimensional grid world
offers a discrete, deterministic, and atomic universal playground, despite its
complexity. In combination with CARLE, Carle's Game offers an initial set of
agent policies, learning and meta-learning algorithms, and reward wrappers that
can be tailored to encourage exploration or specific tasks.]]></summary>

to identify different instrument timbres with as few parameters as possible.
For this purpose, we have worked with classical orchestral instruments played
with different dynamics, which are part of a few instrument families and which
play notes in the same pitch range. It has been possible to assess the ability
to classify instruments by timbre even if the instruments are playing the same
note with the same intensity. The network employed uses a multi-head attention
mechanism, with 8 heads and a dense network at the output taking as input the
log-mel magnitude spectrograms of the sound samples. This network allows the
identification of 20 instrument classes of the classical orchestra, achieving
an overall F$_1$ value of 0.62. An analysis of the weights of the attention
layer has been performed and the confusion matrix of the model is presented,
allowing us to assess the ability of the proposed architecture to distinguish
timbre and to establish the aspects on which future work should focus.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being uncertain when facing the unknown is key to intelligent decision
making. However, machine learning algorithms lack reliable estimates about
their predictive uncertainty. This leads to wrong and overly-confident
decisions when encountering classes unseen during training. Despite the
importance of equipping classifiers with uncertainty estimates ready for the
real world, prior work has focused on small datasets and little or no class
discrepancy between training and testing data. To close this gap, we introduce
UIMNET: a realistic, ImageNet-scale test-bed to evaluate predictive uncertainty
estimates for deep image classifiers. Our benchmark provides implementations of
eight state-of-the-art algorithms, six uncertainty measures, four in-domain
metrics, three out-domain metrics, and a fully automated pipeline to train,
calibrate, ensemble, select, and evaluate models. Our test-bed is open-source
and all of our results are reproducible from a fixed commit in our repository.
Adding new datasets, algorithms, measures, or metrics is a matter of a few
lines of code-in so hoping that UIMNET becomes a stepping stone towards
realistic, rigorous, and reproducible research in uncertainty estimation. Our
results show that ensembles of ERM classifiers as well as single MIMO
classifiers are the two best alternatives currently available to measure
uncertainty about both in-domain and out-domain classes.]]></summary>

as traffic congestion and waste of energy. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a
trending data-driven approach for adaptive traffic signal control in complex
urban traffic networks. Although the development of deep neural networks (DNN)
further enhances its learning capability, there are still some challenges in
applying deep RLs to transportation networks with multiple signalized
intersections, including non-stationarity environment, exploration-exploitation
dilemma, multi-agent training schemes, continuous action spaces, etc. In order
to address these issues, this paper first proposes a multi-agent deep
deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) method by extending the actor-critic
policy gradient algorithms. MADDPG has a centralized learning and decentralized
execution paradigm in which critics use additional information to streamline
the training process, while actors act on their own local observations. The
model is evaluated via simulation on the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO)
platform. Model comparison results show the efficiency of the proposed
algorithm in controlling traffic lights.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motivation: Predicting Drug-Target Interaction (DTI) is a well-studied topic
in bioinformatics due to its relevance in the fields of proteomics and
pharmaceutical research. Although many machine learning methods have been
successfully applied in this task, few of them aim at leveraging the inherent
heterogeneous graph structure in the DTI network to address the challenge. For
better learning and interpreting the DTI topological structure and the
similarity, it is desirable to have methods specifically for predicting
interactions from the graph structure.

Results: We present an end-to-end framework, DTI-GAT (Drug-Target Interaction
prediction with Graph Attention networks) for DTI predictions. DTI-GAT
incorporates a deep neural network architecture that operates on
graph-structured data with the attention mechanism, which leverages both the
interaction patterns and the features of drug and protein sequences. DTI-GAT
facilitates the interpretation of the DTI topological structure by assigning
different attention weights to each node with the self-attention mechanism.
Experimental evaluations show that DTI-GAT outperforms various state-of-the-art
systems on the binary DTI prediction problem. Moreover, the independent study
results further demonstrate that our model can be generalized better than other
conventional methods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: Medical decision-making impacts both individual and public
health. Clinical scores are commonly used among a wide variety of
decision-making models for determining the degree of disease deterioration at
the bedside. AutoScore was proposed as a useful clinical score generator based
on machine learning and a generalized linear model. Its current framework,
however, still leaves room for improvement when addressing unbalanced data of
rare events. Methods: Using machine intelligence approaches, we developed
AutoScore-Imbalance, which comprises three components: training dataset
optimization, sample weight optimization, and adjusted AutoScore. All scoring
models were evaluated on the basis of their area under the curve (AUC) in the
receiver operating characteristic analysis and balanced accuracy (i.e., mean
value of sensitivity and specificity). By utilizing a publicly accessible
dataset from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, we assessed the proposed
model and baseline approaches in the prediction of inpatient mortality.
Results: AutoScore-Imbalance outperformed baselines in terms of AUC and
balanced accuracy. The nine-variable AutoScore-Imbalance sub-model achieved the
highest AUC of 0.786 (0.732-0.839) while the eleven-variable original AutoScore
obtained an AUC of 0.723 (0.663-0.783), and the logistic regression with 21
variables obtained an AUC of 0.743 (0.685-0.800). The AutoScore-Imbalance
sub-model (using down-sampling algorithm) yielded an AUC of 0. 0.771
(0.718-0.823) with only five variables, demonstrating a good balance between
performance and variable sparsity. Conclusions: The AutoScore-Imbalance tool
has the potential to be applied to highly unbalanced datasets to gain further
insight into rare medical events and to facilitate real-world clinical
decision-making.]]></summary>

variant of continual learning that leverages the non-parametric nature of
kernel methods to tackle catastrophic forgetting. We deploy an episodic memory
unit that stores a subset of samples for each task to learn task-specific
classifiers based on kernel ridge regression. This does not require memory
replay and systematically avoids task interference in the classifiers. We
further introduce variational random features to learn a data-driven kernel for
each task. To do so, we formulate kernel continual learning as a variational
inference problem, where a random Fourier basis is incorporated as the latent
variable. The variational posterior distribution over the random Fourier basis
is inferred from the coreset of each task. In this way, we are able to generate
more informative kernels specific to each task, and, more importantly, the
coreset size can be reduced to achieve more compact memory, resulting in more
efficient continual learning based on episodic memory. Extensive evaluation on
four benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness and promise of kernels for
continual learning.]]></summary>

Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem where the transition kernel $P^*$ belongs
to a family of models $\mathcal{P}^*$ with finite metric entropy. In the model
selection framework, instead of $\mathcal{P}^*$, we are given $M$ nested
families of transition kernels $\cP_1 \subset \cP_2 \subset \ldots \subset
\cP_M$. We propose and analyze a novel algorithm, namely \emph{Adaptive
Reinforcement Learning (General)} (\texttt{ARL-GEN}) that adapts to the
smallest such family where the true transition kernel $P^*$ lies.
\texttt{ARL-GEN} uses the Upper Confidence Reinforcement Learning
(\texttt{UCRL}) algorithm with value targeted regression as a blackbox and puts
a model selection module at the beginning of each epoch. Under a mild
separability assumption on the model classes, we show that \texttt{ARL-GEN}
obtains a regret of
$\Tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d_{\mathcal{E}}^*H^2+\sqrt{d_{\mathcal{E}}^* \mathbb{M}^*
H^2 T})$, with high probability, where $H$ is the horizon length, $T$ is the
total number of steps, $d_{\mathcal{E}}^*$ is the Eluder dimension and
$\mathbb{M}^*$ is the metric entropy corresponding to $\mathcal{P}^*$. Note
that this regret scaling matches that of an oracle that knows $\mathcal{P}^*$
in advance. We show that the cost of model selection for \texttt{ARL-GEN} is an
additive term in the regret having a weak dependence on $T$. Subsequently, we
remove the separability assumption and consider the setup of linear mixture
MDPs, where the transition kernel $P^*$ has a linear function approximation.
With this low rank structure, we propose novel adaptive algorithms for model
selection, and obtain (order-wise) regret identical to that of an oracle with
knowledge of the true model class.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent work has shown how easily white-box adversarial attacks can be applied
to state-of-the-art image classifiers. However, real-life scenarios resemble
more the black-box adversarial conditions, lacking transparency and usually
imposing natural, hard constraints on the query budget.

We propose $\textbf{EvoBA}$, a black-box adversarial attack based on a
surprisingly simple evolutionary search strategy. $\textbf{EvoBA}$ is
query-efficient, minimizes $L_0$ adversarial perturbations, and does not
require any form of training.

$\textbf{EvoBA}$ shows efficiency and efficacy through results that are in
line with much more complex state-of-the-art black-box attacks such as
$\textbf{AutoZOOM}$. It is more query-efficient than $\textbf{SimBA}$, a simple
and powerful baseline black-box attack, and has a similar level of complexity.
Therefore, we propose it both as a new strong baseline for black-box
adversarial attacks and as a fast and general tool for gaining empirical
insight into how robust image classifiers are with respect to $L_0$ adversarial
perturbations.

There exist fast and reliable $L_2$ black-box attacks, such as
$\textbf{SimBA}$, and $L_{\infty}$ black-box attacks, such as
$\textbf{DeepSearch}$. We propose $\textbf{EvoBA}$ as a query-efficient $L_0$
black-box adversarial attack which, together with the aforementioned methods,
can serve as a generic tool to assess the empirical robustness of image
classifiers. The main advantages of such methods are that they run fast, are
query-efficient, and can easily be integrated in image classifiers development
pipelines.

While our attack minimises the $L_0$ adversarial perturbation, we also report
$L_2$, and notice that we compare favorably to the state-of-the-art $L_2$
black-box attack, $\textbf{AutoZOOM}$, and of the $L_2$ strong baseline,
$\textbf{SimBA}$.]]></summary>

reinforcement learning (IRL) may encounter objects or agents in the

complete removal is impossible the nuisance observations must be filtered out.
However, identifying the source of observations when large amounts of

Bayesian model that incorporates both the expert's and the confounding
elements' observations thereby explicitly modeling the diverse observations a
robot may receive. We extend an existing IRL algorithm originally designed to
work under partial occlusion of the expert to consider the diverse
observations. In a simulated robotic sorting domain containing both occlusion

(a) access to samples from intermediate distributions, and (b) samples being
annotated with the amount of change from the source distribution, self-training
can be successfully applied on gradually shifted samples to adapt the model
toward the target distribution. We hypothesize having (a) is enough to enable
iterative self-training to slowly adapt the model to the target distribution,
by making use of an implicit curriculum. In the case where (a) does not hold,
we observe that iterative self-training falls short. We propose GIFT, a method
that creates virtual samples from intermediate distributions by interpolating
representations of examples from source and target domains. We evaluate an
iterative-self-training method on datasets with natural distribution shifts,
and show that when applied on top of other domain adaptation methods, it
improves the performance of the model on the target dataset. We run an analysis
on a synthetic dataset to show that in the presence of (a)

Fourier lens. In this paper, we strive to broaden this understanding by showing
that alternative non-Fourier embedding functions can indeed be used for
positional encoding. Moreover, we show that their performance is entirely
determined by a trade-off between the stable rank of the embedded matrix and
the distance preservation between embedded coordinates. We further establish
that the now ubiquitous Fourier feature mapping of position is a special case
that fulfills these conditions. Consequently, we present a more general theory
to analyze positional encoding in terms of shifted basis functions. To this

structure of chemical compounds using both artificial neural networks (ANNs)
and mixed integer linear programming (MILP). In the framework, we first define
a feature vector $f(C)$ of a chemical graph $C$ and construct an ANN that maps
$x=f(C)$ to a predicted value $\eta(x)$ of a chemical property $\pi$ to $C$.
After this, we formulate an MILP that simulates the computation process of
$f(C)$ from $C$ and that of $\eta(x)$ from $x$. Given a target value $y^*$ of
the chemical property $\pi$, we infer a chemical graph $C^\dagger$ such that
$\eta(f(C^\dagger))=y^*$ by solving the MILP. In this paper, we use linear
regression to construct a prediction function $\eta$ instead of ANNs. For this,
we derive an MILP formulation that simulates the computation process of a
prediction function by linear regression. The results of computational
experiments suggest our method can infer chemical graphs with around up to 50

(DRL) via combining deep learning (DL) with reinforcement learning (RL), which
has noticed that the distribution of the acquired data would change during the
training process. DQN found this property might cause instability for training,
so it proposed effective methods to handle the downside of the property.
Instead of focusing on the unfavourable aspects, we find it critical for RL to
ease the gap between the estimated data distribution and the ground truth data
distribution while supervised learning (SL) fails to do so. From this new
perspective, we extend the basic paradigm of RL called the Generalized Policy
Iteration (GPI) into a more generalized version, which is called the
Generalized Data Distribution Iteration (GDI). We see massive RL algorithms and
techniques can be unified into the GDI paradigm, which can be considered as one
of the special cases of GDI. We provide theoretical proof of why GDI is better
than GPI and how it works. Several practical algorithms based on GDI have been
proposed to verify the effectiveness and extensiveness of it. Empirical
experiments prove our state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on Arcade Learning

perceptually impressive synthesis, but can they also be great likelihood-based
models? We answer this in the affirmative, and introduce a family of
diffusion-based generative models that obtain state-of-the-art likelihoods on
standard image density estimation benchmarks. Unlike other diffusion-based
models, our method allows for efficient optimization of the noise schedule
jointly with the rest of the model. We show that the variational lower bound
(VLB) simplifies to a remarkably short expression in terms of the
signal-to-noise ratio of the diffused data, thereby improving our theoretical
understanding of this model class. Using this insight, we prove an equivalence
between several models proposed in the literature. In addition, we show that
the continuous-time VLB is invariant to the noise schedule, except for the
signal-to-noise ratio at its endpoints. This enables us to learn a noise
schedule that minimizes the variance of the resulting VLB estimator, leading to
faster optimization. Combining these advances with architectural improvements,
we obtain state-of-the-art likelihoods on image density estimation benchmarks,
outperforming autoregressive models that have dominated these benchmarks for
many years, with often significantly faster optimization. In addition, we show
how to turn the model into a bits-back compression scheme, and demonstrate
lossless compression rates close to the theoretical optimum.]]></summary>

is necessary for an agent to exploit its observation history in the considered
place and efficiently reach known goals. This ability can be associated with
spatial reasoning, where an agent is able to perceive spatial relationships and
regularities, and discover object affordances. In classical Reinforcement
Learning (RL) setups, this capacity is learned from reward alone. We introduce
supplementary supervision in the form of auxiliary tasks designed to favor the
emergence of spatial perception capabilities in agents trained for a
goal-reaching downstream objective. We show that learning to estimate metrics
quantifying the spatial relationships between an agent at a given location and
a goal to reach has a high positive impact in Multi-Object Navigation settings.
Our method significantly improves the performance of different baseline agents,
that either build an explicit or implicit representation of the environment,
even matching the performance of incomparable oracle agents taking ground-truth

approach to multi-label classification (MLC) using 1-dimensional convolution
kernels to learn label dependencies at multi-scale. Modern multi-label
classifiers have been adopting recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a memory
structure to capture and exploit label dependency relations. The RNN-based MLC
models however tend to introduce a very large number of parameters that may
cause under-/over-fitting problems. The proposed method uses the 1-dimensional
convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) to serve the same purpose in a more
efficient manner. By training a model with multiple kernel sizes, the method is
able to learn the dependency relations among labels at multiple scales, while
it uses a drastically smaller number of parameters. With public benchmark
datasets, we demonstrate that our model can achieve better accuracies with much
smaller number of model parameters compared to RNN-based MLC models.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Transformers provide a class of expressive architectures that are extremely
effective for sequence modeling. However, the key limitation of transformers is
their quadratic memory and time complexity $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ with respect to
the sequence length in attention layers, which restricts application in
extremely long sequences. Most existing approaches leverage sparsity or
low-rank assumptions in the attention matrix to reduce cost, but sacrifice
expressiveness. Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attention
capability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memory
complexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as a
conditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate the
conditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location can
attend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirect
attention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations of
embeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attention
patterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design of
such factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost
($\mathcal{O}(L\log(L))$ or $\mathcal{O}(L\sqrt{L})$). Combiner is a drop-in
replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily
implemented in common frameworks. An experimental evaluation on both
autoregressive and bidirectional sequence tasks demonstrates the effectiveness
of this approach, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text
modeling tasks.]]></summary>

informative labels) can instead return us more accurate and fair models. We are
primarily inspired by two observations that 1) increasing a certain class of
instances' label noise to balance the noise rates (increasing-to-balancing)
results in an easier learning problem; 2) Increasing-to-balancing improves
fairness guarantees against label bias. In this paper, we will first quantify
the trade-offs introduced by increasing a certain group of instances' label
noise rate w.r.t. the learning difficulties and performance guarantees. We
analytically demonstrate when such an increase proves to be beneficial, in
terms of either improved generalization errors or the fairness guarantees. Then
we present a method to leverage our idea of inserting label noise for the task
of learning with noisy labels, either without or with a fairness constraint.
The primary technical challenge we face is due to the fact that we would not
know which data instances are suffering from higher noise, and we would not
have the ground truth labels to verify any possible hypothesis. We propose a
detection method that informs us which group of labels might suffer from higher
noise, without using ground truth information. We formally establish the
effectiveness of the proposed solution and demonstrate it with extensive
experiments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A major research direction in contextual bandits is to develop algorithms
that are computationally efficient, yet support flexible, general-purpose
function approximation. Algorithms based on modeling rewards have shown strong
empirical performance, but typically require a well-specified model, and can
fail when this assumption does not hold. Can we design algorithms that are
efficient and flexible, yet degrade gracefully in the face of model
misspecification? We introduce a new family of oracle-efficient algorithms for
$\varepsilon$-misspecified contextual bandits that adapt to unknown model
misspecification -- both for finite and infinite action settings. Given access
to an online oracle for square loss regression, our algorithm attains optimal
regret and -- in particular -- optimal dependence on the misspecification
level, with no prior knowledge. Specializing to linear contextual bandits with
infinite actions in $d$ dimensions, we obtain the first algorithm that achieves
the optimal $O(d\sqrt{T} + \varepsilon\sqrt{d}T)$ regret bound for unknown
misspecification level $\varepsilon$.

On a conceptual level, our results are enabled by a new optimization-based
perspective on the regression oracle reduction framework of Foster and Rakhlin,
which we anticipate will find broader use.]]></summary>

diversity maintenance, especially in rich communities where the complexity of
these patterns is magnified through indirect interactions that prevent their

cutting-edge Machine Learning techniques called Generative Artificial
Intelligence (GenAI) to decipher species coexistence patterns in vegetation
patches, training generative adversarial networks (GAN) and variational
AutoEncoders (VAE) that are then used to unravel some of the mechanisms behind
community assemblage. 3. The GAN accurately reproduces the species composition
of real patches as well as the affinity of plant species to different soil
types, and the VAE also reaches a high level of accuracy, above 99%. Using the
artificially generated patches, we found that high order interactions tend to
suppress the positive effects of low order interactions. Finally, by
reconstructing successional trajectories we could identify the pioneer species
with larger potential to generate a high diversity of distinct patches in terms
of species composition. 4. Understanding the complexity of species coexistence

This perception led to analyzing deep learning models not only from the

to their robustness. We aim to investigate any existing correlations between
graph theoretic properties and the robustness of Sparse Neural Networks. Our
hypothesis is, that graph theoretic properties as a prior of neural network
structures are related to their robustness. To answer to this hypothesis, we
designed an empirical study with neural network models obtained through random
graphs used as sparse structural priors for the networks. We additionally
investigated the evaluation of a randomly pruned fully connected network as a
point of reference.

We found that robustness measures are independent of initialization methods
but show weak correlations with graph properties: higher graph densities
correlate with lower robustness, but higher average path lengths and average

continuity of many software systems, especially large-scale distributed
systems. They faithfully record runtime information to facilitate system
troubleshooting and behavior understanding. Due to the large scale and
complexity of modern software systems, the volume of logs has reached an
unprecedented level. Consequently, for log-based anomaly detection,
conventional methods of manual inspection or even traditional machine
learning-based methods become impractical, which serve as a catalyst for the
rapid development of deep learning-based solutions. However, there is currently
a lack of rigorous comparison among the representative log-based anomaly
detectors which resort to neural network models. Moreover, the
re-implementation process demands non-trivial efforts and bias can be easily
introduced. To better understand the characteristics of different anomaly
detectors, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review and evaluation on
five popular models used by six state-of-the-art methods. Particularly, four of
the selected methods are unsupervised and the remaining two are supervised.
These methods are evaluated with two publicly-available log datasets, which
contain nearly 16 millions log messages and 0.4 million anomaly instances in
total. We believe our work can serve as a basis in this field and contribute to
the future academic researches and industrial applications.]]></summary>

information in noisy environments is a key and challenging goal. A stimulating,
though controversial, hypothesis poses that operating in dynamical regimes near
the edge of a phase transition, i.e. at criticality or the "edge of chaos", can
provide information-processing living systems with important operational
advantages, creating, e.g., an optimal trade-off between robustness and
flexibility. Here, we elaborate on a recent theoretical result, which
establishes that the spectrum of covariance matrices of neural networks
representing complex inputs in a robust way needs to decay as a power-law of
the rank, with an exponent close to unity, a result that has been indeed
experimentally verified in neurons of the mouse visual cortex. Aimed at
understanding and mimicking these results, we construct an artificial neural
network and train it to classify images. Remarkably, we find that the best
performance in such a task is obtained when the network operates near the
critical point, at which the eigenspectrum of the covariance matrix follows the
very same statistics as actual neurons do. Thus, we conclude that operating
near criticality can also have -- besides the usually alleged virtues -- the
advantage of allowing for flexible, robust and efficient input representations.]]></summary>

a cornerstone of artificial intelligence. While existing methods are typically
evaluated on downstream tasks such as classification or generative image

10,000 reinforcement learning policies, we extensively evaluate to what extent
different representation properties affect out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of these policies

power-hungry, owing to data transfer between memory and logic units.
Oxide-based RRAMs are outstanding candidates to implement in-memory computing,
which is less power-intensive. Their weak RESET regime, is particularly
attractive for learning, as it allows tuning the resistance of the devices with
remarkable endurance. However, the resistive change behavior in this regime
suffers many fluctuations and is particularly challenging to model, especially
in a way compatible with tools used for simulating deep learning. In this work,
we present a model of the weak RESET process in hafnium oxide RRAM and
integrate this model within the PyTorch deep learning framework. Validated on
experiments on a hybrid CMOS/RRAM technology, our model reproduces both the
noisy progressive behavior and the device-to-device (D2D) variability. We use
this tool to train Binarized Neural Networks for the MNIST handwritten digit
recognition task and the CIFAR-10 object classification task. We simulate our
model with and without various aspects of device imperfections to understand
their impact on the training process and identify that the D2D variability is
the most detrimental aspect. The framework can be used in the same manner for
other types of memories to identify the device imperfections that cause the
most degradation, which can, in turn, be used to optimize the devices to reduce
the impact of these imperfections.]]></summary>

Importantly, while it is the artificial agent that learns and acts, it is still

task-specification approaches typically involve humans providing stationary
reward functions or explicit demonstrations of the desired tasks. However,
there has recently been a great deal of research energy invested in exploring
alternative ways in which humans may guide learning agents that may, e.g., be
more suitable for certain tasks or require less human effort. This survey
provides a high-level overview of five recent machine learning frameworks that

can be effectively incorporated into well-know forecast architectures,
requiring a low number of parameters and producing interpretable results that
improve forecasting accuracy. We test the Spectral Attention Autoregressive

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A variety of recent works, spanning pruning, lottery tickets, and training
within random subspaces, have shown that deep neural networks can be trained
using far fewer degrees of freedom than the total number of parameters. We
explain this phenomenon by first examining the success probability of hitting a
training loss sub-level set when training within a random subspace of a given
training dimensionality. We find a sharp phase transition in the success
probability from $0$ to $1$ as the training dimension surpasses a threshold.
This threshold training dimension increases as the desired final loss
decreases, but decreases as the initial loss decreases. We then theoretically
explain the origin of this phase transition, and its dependence on
initialization and final desired loss, in terms of precise properties of the
high dimensional geometry of the loss landscape. In particular, we show via
Gordon's escape theorem, that the training dimension plus the Gaussian width of
the desired loss sub-level set, projected onto a unit sphere surrounding the
initialization, must exceed the total number of parameters for the success
probability to be large. In several architectures and datasets, we measure the
threshold training dimension as a function of initialization and demonstrate
that it is a small fraction of the total number of parameters, thereby
implying, by our theory, that successful training with so few dimensions is
possible precisely because the Gaussian width of low loss sub-level sets is
very large. Moreover, this threshold training dimension provides a strong null
model for assessing the efficacy of more sophisticated ways to reduce training
degrees of freedom, including lottery tickets as well a more optimal method we
introduce: lottery subspaces.]]></summary>

effective models for semi-supervised learning, but facing the obstacle of
over-smoothing, which will weaken the representation ability of GCNs. Recently
some works are proposed to tackle with above limitation by randomly perturbing
graph topology or feature matrix to generate data augmentations as input for
training. However, these operations have to pay the price of information
structure integrity breaking, and inevitably sacrifice information
stochastically from original graph. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph
entropy definition as an quantitative index to evaluate feature information
diffusion among a graph. Under considerations of preserving graph entropy, we
propose an effective strategy to generate perturbed training data using a
stochastic mechanism but guaranteeing graph topology integrity and with only a
small amount of graph entropy decaying. Extensive experiments have been
conducted on real-world datasets and the results verify the effectiveness of
our proposed method in improving semi-supervised node classification accuracy
compared with a surge of baselines. Beyond that, our proposed approach
significantly enhances the robustness and generalization ability of GCNs during

machine learning provider can convey confidence to decision-makers by
guaranteeing their predictions are distribution calibrated -- amongst the
inputs that receive a predicted class probabilities vector $q$, the actual
distribution over classes is $q$. For multi-class prediction problems, however,
achieving distribution calibration tends to be infeasible, requiring sample
complexity exponential in the number of classes $C$. In this work, we introduce
a new notion -- \emph{decision calibration} -- that requires the predicted
distribution and true distribution to be ``indistinguishable'' to a set of
downstream decision-makers. When all possible decision makers are under
consideration, decision calibration is the same as distribution calibration.
However, when we only consider decision makers choosing between a bounded
number of actions (e.g. polynomial in $C$), our main result shows that
decisions calibration becomes feasible -- we design a recalibration algorithm
that requires sample complexity polynomial in the number of actions and the
number of classes. We validate our recalibration algorithm empirically:

multiple knowledge sequentially, and a growing number of approaches have been
proposed to mitigate this problem. Some of these methods achieved considerable
performance by associating the flat local minima with forgetting mitigation in
continual learning. However, they inevitably need (1) tedious hyperparameters
tuning, and (2) additional computational cost. To alleviate these problems, in
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective optimization method, called
AlterSGD, to search for a flat minima in the loss landscape. In AlterSGD, we
conduct gradient descent and ascent alternatively when the network tends to
converge at each session of learning new knowledge. Moreover, we theoretically
prove that such a strategy can encourage the optimization to converge to a flat
minima. We verify AlterSGD on continual learning benchmark for semantic
segmentation and the empirical results show that we can significantly mitigate
the forgetting and outperform the state-of-the-art methods with a large margin
under challenging continual learning protocols.]]></summary>

framework for NFV-enabled networks. In the proposed system model, the goal is
to maximize energy efficiency (EE), by guaranteeing end-to-end (E2E) quality of
service (QoS) for different service types. To this end, we formulate an
optimization problem in which power and spectrum resources are allocated in the
radio part. In the core part, the chaining, placement, and scheduling of
functions are performed to ensure the QoS of all users. This joint optimization
problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), considering time-varying
characteristics of the available resources and wireless channels. A soft
actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (SAC-DRL) algorithm based on the
maximum entropy framework is subsequently utilized to solve the above MDP.
Numerical results reveal that the proposed joint approach based on the SAC-DRL
algorithm could significantly reduce energy consumption compared to the case in
which R-RA and NFV-RA problems are optimized separately.]]></summary>

lack of prediction explainability, several methods have been developed to
explain a model's behavior in terms of the training data points that most
influence the model. However, these methods tend to mark outliers as highly
influential points, limiting the insights that practitioners can draw from
points that are not representative of the training data. In this work, we take
a step towards finding influential training points that also represent the
training data well. We first review methods for assigning importance scores to
training points. Given importance scores, we propose a method to select a set
of DIVerse INfluEntial (DIVINE) training points as a useful explanation of
model behavior. As practitioners might not only be interested in finding data
points influential with respect to model accuracy, but also with respect to
other important metrics, we show how to evaluate training data points on the
basis of group fairness. Our method can identify unfairness-inducing training
points, which can be removed to improve fairness outcomes. Our quantitative
experiments and user studies show that visualizing DIVINE points helps
practitioners understand and explain model behavior better than earlier

through targeted labeling, enabling significant labeling cost savings. As most
research on active learning has been carried out before transformer-based
language models ("transformers") became popular, despite its practical
importance, comparably few papers have investigated how transformers can be
combined with active learning to date. This can be attributed to the fact that
using state-of-the-art query strategies for transformers induces a prohibitive
runtime overhead, which effectively cancels out, or even outweighs
aforementioned cost savings. In this paper, we revisit uncertainty-based query
strategies, which had been largely outperformed before, but are particularly
suited in the context of fine-tuning transformers. In an extensive evaluation
on five widely used text classification benchmarks, we show that considerable
improvements of up to 14.4 percentage points in area under the learning curve
are achieved, as well as a final accuracy close to the state of the art for all
but one benchmark, using only between 0.4% and 15% of the training data.]]></summary>

statistical structure, with many real-world applications in science and
engineering from controlling robotic arms to understanding neuronal
computations. A major challenge for these graphical models is that inferences
such as marginalization are intractable for general graphs. These inferences
are often approximated by a distributed message-passing algorithm such as
Belief Propagation, which does not always perform well on graphs with cycles,
nor can it always be easily specified for complex continuous probability
distributions. Such difficulties arise frequently in expressive graphical
models that include intractable higher-order interactions. In this paper we
construct iterative message-passing algorithms using Graph Neural Networks
defined on factor graphs to achieve fast approximate inference on graphical
models that involve many-variable interactions. Experimental results on several
families of graphical models demonstrate the out-of-distribution generalization
capability of our method to different sized graphs, and indicate the domain in
which our method gains advantage over Belief Propagation.]]></summary>

Kullback-Leibler divergence which is often used in machine learning, signal
processing, and information sciences. Since the Jeffreys divergence between the
ubiquitous Gaussian Mixture Models are not available in closed-form, many
techniques with various pros and cons have been proposed in the literature to
either (i) estimate, (ii) approximate, or (iii) lower and upper bound this
divergence. In this work, we propose a simple yet fast heuristic to approximate
the Jeffreys divergence between two GMMs of arbitrary number of components. The
heuristic relies on converting GMMs into pairs of dually parameterized
probability densities belonging to exponential families. In particular, we
consider Polynomial Exponential Densities, and design a goodness-of-fit
criterion to measure the dissimilarity between a GMM and a PED which is a
generalization of the Hyv\"arinen divergence. This criterion allows one to
select the orders of the PEDs to approximate the GMMs. We demonstrate
experimentally that the computational time of our heuristic improves over the
stochastic Monte Carlo estimation baseline by several orders of magnitude while
approximating reasonably well the Jeffreys divergence, specially when the
univariate mixtures have a small number of modes.]]></summary>

and models in deep learning. While it is computationally beneficial to use
large batch sizes, it often requires a specially designed learning rate (LR)
schedule to achieve a comparable level of performance as in smaller batch
training. Especially, when the number of training epochs is constrained, the
use of a large LR and a warmup strategy is critical in the final performance of
large-batch training due to the reduced number of updating steps. In this work,
we propose an automated LR scheduling algorithm which is effective for neural
network training with a large batch size under the given epoch budget. In
specific, the whole schedule consists of two phases: adaptive warmup and
predefined decay, where the LR is increased until the training loss no longer
decreases and decreased to zero until the end of training. Here, whether the
training loss has reached the minimum value is robustly checked with Gaussian
process smoothing in an online manner with a low computational burden. Coupled
with adaptive stochastic optimizers such as AdamP and LAMB, the proposed
scheduler successfully adjusts the LRs without cumbersome hyperparameter tuning
and achieves comparable or better performances than tuned baselines on various
image classification benchmarks and architectures with a wide range of batch
sizes.]]></summary>

applications for over the top (OTT) and networking use cases. The success of
these use cases will depend on the availability of big data sets which is not

and the cost of data collection procedures. Transfer learning (TL) is a
promising approach to deal with these challenges through the sharing of

learning accuracy can be considerably improved. However, there are
implementation challenges to efficiently deploy and utilize TL in 6G. In this

examples of TL in 6G and highlight the spatio-temporal features of data in 6G
that can lead to efficient TL. By simulation results, we demonstrate how
transferring the quantized neural network weights between two use cases can
make a trade-off between overheads and performance and attain more efficient TL

surfaces owing to the inherent flexibility of interlooped yarns and recent
advances in manufacturing providing better control of local stitch patterns.
Fully yarn-level modelling of large-scale knitted membranes is not feasible.
Therefore, we consider a two-scale homogenisation approach and model the
membrane as a Kirchhoff-Love shell on the macroscale and as Euler-Bernoulli
rods on the microscale. The governing equations for both the shell and the rod
are discretised with cubic B-spline basis functions. The solution of the
nonlinear microscale problem requires a significant amount of time due to the
large deformations and the enforcement of contact constraints, rendering
conventional online computational homogenisation approaches infeasible. To
sidestep this problem, we use a pre-trained statistical Gaussian Process
Regression (GPR) model to map the macroscale deformations to macroscale
stresses. During the offline learning phase, the GPR model is trained by
solving the microscale problem for a sufficiently rich set of deformation
states obtained by either uniform or Sobol sampling. The trained GPR model
encodes the nonlinearities and anisotropies present in the microscale and
serves as a material model for the macroscale Kirchhoff-Love shell. After
verifying and validating the different components of the proposed approach, we
introduce several examples involving membranes subjected to tension and shear

representations from conventional MIR models which are pre-trained on tagging,
we find that using representations from Jukebox as input features yields 30%
stronger performance on average across four MIR tasks: tagging, genre
classification, emotion recognition, and key detection. For key detection, we
observe that representations from Jukebox are considerably stronger than those

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dense optical flow estimation is challenging when there are large
displacements in a scene with heterogeneous motion dynamics, occlusion, and
scene homogeneity. Traditional approaches to handle these challenges include
hierarchical and multiresolution processing methods. Learning-based optical
flow methods typically use a multiresolution approach with image warping when a
broad range of flow velocities and heterogeneous motion is present. Accuracy of
such coarse-to-fine methods is affected by the ghosting artifacts when images
are warped across multiple resolutions and by the vanishing problem in smaller
scene extents with higher motion contrast. Previously, we devised strategies
for building compact dense prediction networks guided by the effective
receptive field (ERF) characteristics of the network (DDCNet). The DDCNet
design was intentionally simple and compact allowing it to be used as a
building block for designing more complex yet compact networks. In this work,
we extend the DDCNet strategies to handle heterogeneous motion dynamics by
cascading DDCNet based sub-nets with decreasing extents of their ERF. Our
DDCNet with multiresolution capability (DDCNet-Multires) is compact without any
specialized network layers. We evaluate the performance of the DDCNet-Multires
network using standard optical flow benchmark datasets. Our experiments
demonstrate that DDCNet-Multires improves over the DDCNet-B0 and -B1 and
provides optical flow estimates with accuracy comparable to similar lightweight
learning-based methods.]]></summary>

feedback between layers, are often biologically implausible, and are vulnerable
to adversarial attacks that humans are not susceptible to. On the other hand,
Hebbian learning in winner-take-all (WTA) networks, is unsupervised,
feed-forward, and biologically plausible. However, an objective optimization
theory for WTA networks has been missing, except under very limiting
assumptions. Here we derive formally such a theory, based on biologically
plausible but generic ANN elements. Through Hebbian learning, network
parameters maintain a Bayesian generative model of the data. There is no
supervisory loss function, but the network does minimize cross-entropy between
its activations and the input distribution. The key is a "soft" WTA where there
is no absolute "hard" winner neuron, and a specific type of Hebbian-like
plasticity of weights and biases. We confirm our theory in practice, where, in
handwritten digit (MNIST) recognition, our Hebbian algorithm, SoftHebb,
minimizes cross-entropy without having access to it, and outperforms the more
frequently used, hard-WTA-based method. Strikingly, it even outperforms
supervised end-to-end backpropagation, under certain conditions. Specifically,
in a two-layered network, SoftHebb outperforms backpropagation when the
training dataset is only presented once, when the testing data is noisy, and
under gradient-based adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks that confuse
SoftHebb are also confusing to the human eye. Finally, the model can generate
interpolations of objects from its input distribution.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Combinatorial optimization (CO) has been a hot research topic because of its
theoretic and practical importance. As a classic CO problem, deep hashing aims
to find an optimal code for each data from finite discrete possibilities, while
the discrete nature brings a big challenge to the optimization process.
Previous methods usually mitigate this challenge by binary approximation,
substituting binary codes for real-values via activation functions or
regularizations. However, such approximation leads to uncertainty between
real-values and binary ones, degrading retrieval performance. In this paper, we
propose a novel Deep Momentum Uncertainty Hashing (DMUH). It explicitly
estimates the uncertainty during training and leverages the uncertainty
information to guide the approximation process. Specifically, we model
bit-level uncertainty via measuring the discrepancy between the output of a
hashing network and that of a momentum-updated network. The discrepancy of each
bit indicates the uncertainty of the hashing network to the approximate output
of that bit. Meanwhile, the mean discrepancy of all bits in a hashing code can
be regarded as image-level uncertainty. It embodies the uncertainty of the
hashing network to the corresponding input image. The hashing bit and image
with higher uncertainty are paid more attention during optimization. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study the uncertainty in
hashing bits. Extensive experiments are conducted on four datasets to verify
the superiority of our method, including CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE, MS-COCO, and a
million-scale dataset Clothing1M. Our method achieves the best performance on
all of the datasets and surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods by a large
margin.]]></summary>

preserving high-frequency information -- through the encoding of coordinate
positions as an array of Fourier features. Hitherto, the rationale for the
effectiveness of these positional encodings has been solely studied through a
Fourier lens. In this paper, we strive to broaden this understanding by showing
that alternative non-Fourier embedding functions can indeed be used for
positional encoding. Moreover, we show that their performance is entirely
determined by a trade-off between the stable rank of the embedded matrix and
the distance preservation between embedded coordinates. We further establish
that the now ubiquitous Fourier feature mapping of position is a special case
that fulfills these conditions. Consequently, we present a more general theory
to analyze positional encoding in terms of shifted basis functions. To this
end, we develop the necessary theoretical formulae and empirically verify that
our theoretical claims hold in practice. Codes available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent trend in Non-Rigid Structure-from-Motion (NRSfM) is to express
local, differential constraints between pairs of images, from which the surface
normal at any point can be obtained by solving a system of polynomial
equations. The systems of equations derived in previous work, however, are of
high degree, having up to five real solutions, thus requiring a computationally
expensive strategy to select a unique solution. Furthermore, they suffer from
degeneracies that make the resulting estimates unreliable, without any
mechanism to identify this situation.

In this paper, we show that, under widely applicable assumptions, we can
derive a new system of equation in terms of the surface normals whose two
solutions can be obtained in closed-form and can easily be disambiguated
locally. Our formalism further allows us to assess how reliable the estimated
local normals are and, hence, to discard them if they are not. Our experiments
show that our reconstructions, obtained from two or more views, are
significantly more accurate than those of state-of-the-art methods, while also

function (PUF) outputs facilitate reliable, secure, and private key agreement
with the help of public, noiseless, and authenticated storage. PUF outputs are
highly correlated, so transform coding methods have been combined with scalar
quantizers to extract uncorrelated bit sequences with reliability guarantees.
For PUF circuits with continuous-valued outputs, the models for transformed
outputs are made more realistic by replacing the fitted distributions with
corresponding truncated ones. The state-of-the-art PUF methods that provide
reliability guarantees to each extracted bit are shown to be inadequate to
guarantee the same reliability level for all PUF outputs. Thus, a quality of
service parameter is introduced to control the percentage of PUF outputs for
which a target reliability level can be guaranteed. A public ring oscillator
(RO) output dataset is used to illustrate that a truncated Gaussian
distribution can be fitted to transformed RO outputs that are inputs to uniform
scalar quantizers such that reliability guarantees can be provided for each bit
extracted from any PUF device under additive Gaussian noise components by
eliminating a small subset of PUF outputs. Furthermore, we conversely show that
it is not possible to provide such reliability guarantees without eliminating
any PUF output if no extra secrecy and privacy leakage is allowed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are commonly used for modeling complex
distributions of data. Both the generators and discriminators of GANs are often
modeled by neural networks, posing a non-transparent optimization problem which
is non-convex and non-concave over the generator and discriminator,
respectively. Such networks are often heuristically optimized with gradient
descent-ascent (GDA), but it is unclear whether the optimization problem
contains any saddle points, or whether heuristic methods can find them in
practice. In this work, we analyze the training of Wasserstein GANs with
two-layer neural network discriminators through the lens of convex duality, and
for a variety of generators expose the conditions under which Wasserstein GANs
can be solved exactly with convex optimization approaches, or can be
represented as convex-concave games. Using this convex duality interpretation,
we further demonstrate the impact of different activation functions of the
discriminator. Our observations are verified with numerical results
demonstrating the power of the convex interpretation, with applications in
progressive training of convex architectures corresponding to linear generators
and quadratic-activation discriminators for CelebA image generation. The code

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite their outstanding accuracy, semi-supervised segmentation methods
based on deep neural networks can still yield predictions that are considered
anatomically impossible by clinicians, for instance, containing holes or
disconnected regions. To solve this problem, we present a Context-aware Virtual
Adversarial Training (CaVAT) method for generating anatomically plausible
segmentation. Unlike approaches focusing solely on accuracy, our method also
considers complex topological constraints like connectivity which cannot be
easily modeled in a differentiable loss function. We use adversarial training
to generate examples violating the constraints, so the network can learn to
avoid making such incorrect predictions on new examples, and employ the
Reinforce algorithm to handle non-differentiable segmentation constraints. The
proposed method offers a generic and efficient way to add any constraint on top
of any segmentation network. Experiments on two clinically-relevant datasets
show our method to produce segmentations that are both accurate and
anatomically-plausible in terms of region connectivity.]]></summary>

within a Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) solution using a brightfield microscope.
However, this method takes a long time, is based on the experience of the
clinician, and has a low accuracy. With the increase of neural network
applications in the field of clinical microscopy it is now possible to automate
such manual processes increasing both efficiency and accuracy. This study
presents a deep neural network structure that enables the rapid solutions for
these problems and can perform automatic fungi detection in grayscale images
without colorants. Microscopic images of 81 fungi and 235 ceratine were
collected. Then, smaller patches were extracted containing 2062 fungi and 2142
ceratine. In order to detect fungus and ceratine, two models were created one
of which was a custom neural network and the other was based on the VGG16
architecture. The developed custom model had 99.84% accuracy, and an area under
the curve (AUC) value of 1.00, while the VGG16 model had 98.89% accuracy and an
AUC value of 0.99. However, average accuracy and AUC value of clinicians is
72.8% and 0.87 respectively. This deep learning model allows the development of
an automated system that can detect fungi within microscopic images.]]></summary>

convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide the current state of the art in
denoising natural images, where they produce impressive results. However, their
potential has barely been explored in the context of scientific imaging.
Denoising CNNs are typically trained on real natural images artificially
corrupted with simulated noise. In contrast, in scientific applications,
noiseless ground-truth images are usually not available. To address this issue,
we propose a simulation-based denoising (SBD) framework, in which CNNs are
trained on simulated images. We test the framework on data obtained from
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), an imaging technique with widespread
applications in material science, biology, and medicine. SBD outperforms
existing techniques by a wide margin on a simulated benchmark dataset, as well
as on real data. Apart from the denoised images, SBD generates likelihood maps
to visualize the agreement between the structure of the denoised image and the
observed data. Our results reveal shortcomings of state-of-the-art denoising
architectures, such as their small field-of-view: substantially increasing the
field-of-view of the CNNs allows them to exploit non-local periodic patterns in
the data, which is crucial at high noise levels. In addition, we analyze the
generalization capability of SBD, demonstrating that the trained networks are
robust to variations of imaging parameters and of the underlying signal
structure. Finally, we release the first publicly available benchmark dataset
of TEM images, containing 18,000 examples.]]></summary>

distributions are the same. To this end, a key requirement is to develop models
that can generalize to unseen distributions. Domain generalization (DG), i.e.,
out-of-distribution generalization, has attracted increasing interests in
recent years. Domain generalization deals with a challenging setting where one
or several different but related domain(s) are given, and the goal is to learn
a model that can generalize to an unseen test domain. Great progress has been
made in the area of domain generalization for years. This paper presents the
first review of recent advances in this area. First, we provide a formal
definition of domain generalization and discuss several related fields. We then
thoroughly review the theories related to domain generalization and carefully
analyze the theory behind generalization. We categorize recent algorithms into
three classes: data manipulation, representation learning, and learning
strategy, and present several popular algorithms in detail for each category.
Third, we introduce the commonly used datasets and applications. Finally, we
summarize existing literature and present some potential research topics for
the future.]]></summary>

medical image data. Classically, they account for pre-defined statistics of
shape, texture, and other low-level image features. Alternatively, deep
learning-based representations are derived from supervised learning but require
expensive annotations from experts and often suffer from overfitting and data
imbalance issues. In this work, we address the challenge of learning
representations of 3D medical images for an effective quantification under data
imbalance. We propose a \emph{self-supervised} representation learning
framework to learn high-level features of 3D volumes as a complement to
existing radiomics features. Specifically, we demonstrate how to learn image
representations in a self-supervised fashion using a 3D Siamese network. More
importantly, we deal with data imbalance by exploiting two unsupervised
strategies: a) sample re-weighting, and b) balancing the composition of
training batches. When combining our learned self-supervised feature with
traditional radiomics, we show significant improvement in brain tumor
classification and lung cancer staging tasks covering MRI and CT imaging
modalities.]]></summary>

of tensors, each of an arbitrary shape, which is often seen in Neural Networks.
Each of the tensors in the set is modeled using Tensor Rings, though the
concept applies to other Tensor Networks. Owing its name to the T-shape of
nodes in diagram notation of Tensor Rings, T-Basis is simply a list of equally
shaped three-dimensional tensors, used to represent Tensor Ring nodes. Such
representation allows us to parameterize the tensor set with a small number of
parameters (coefficients of the T-Basis tensors), scaling logarithmically with
each tensor's size in the set and linearly with the dimensionality of T-Basis.
We evaluate the proposed approach on the task of neural network compression and
demonstrate that it reaches high compression rates at acceptable performance
drops. Finally, we analyze memory and operation requirements of the compressed
networks and conclude that T-Basis networks are equally well suited for
training and inference in resource-constrained environments and usage on the
edge devices.]]></summary>

multi-label classification tasks, i.e., some policies may have negative impacts

a novel Label-Based AutoAugmentation (LB-Aug) method for multi-label scenarios,
where augmentation policies are generated with respect to labels by an
augmentation-policy network. The policies are learned via reinforcement
learning using policy gradient methods, providing a mapping from instance

segment ground-glass opacity and high opacity (including consolidation and
pleural effusion). The performance of the method was evaluated on CT data sets
from 197 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction

coefficient of 0.876 $\pm$ 0.005; excellent correlations of 0.978 and 0.981 for

the result that any other party has. Furthermore, the party that trains the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detecting anatomical landmarks in medical images plays an essential role in
understanding the anatomy and planning automated processing. In recent years, a
variety of deep neural network methods have been developed to detect landmarks
automatically. However, all of those methods are unary in the sense that a
highly specialized network is trained for a single task say associated with a
particular anatomical region. In this work, for the first time, we investigate
the idea of ``You Only Learn Once (YOLO)'' and develop a universal anatomical
landmark detection model to realize multiple landmark detection tasks with
end-to-end training based on mixed datasets. The model consists of a local
network and a global network: The local network is built upon the idea of
universal U-Net to learn multi-domain local features and the global network is
a parallelly-duplicated sequential of dilated convolutions that extract global
features to further disambiguate the landmark locations. It is worth mentioning
that the new model design requires much fewer parameters than models with
standard convolutions to train. We evaluate our YOLO model on three X-ray
datasets of 1,588 images on the head, hand, and chest, collectively
contributing 62 landmarks. The experimental results show that our proposed
universal model behaves largely better than any previous models trained on
multiple datasets. It even beats the performance of the model that is trained
separately for every single dataset.]]></summary>

driving (AD). The performance, typically evaluated in terms of mean Average
Precision, does not take into account orientation and distance of the actors in
the scene, which are important for the safe AD. It also ignores environmental
context. Recently, Philion et al. proposed a neural planning metric (PKL),
based on the KL divergence of a planner's trajectory and the groundtruth route,
to accommodate these requirements. In this paper, we use this neural planning
metric to score all submissions of the nuScenes detection challenge and analyze
the results. We find that while somewhat correlated with mAP, the PKL metric
shows different behavior to increased traffic density, ego velocity, road
curvature and intersections. Finally, we propose ideas to extend the neural
planning metric.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging via multi-exposure fusion is an important
task for most modern imaging platforms. In spite of recent developments in both
hardware and algorithm innovations, challenges remain over content association
ambiguities caused by saturation, motion, and various artifacts introduced
during multi-exposure fusion such as ghosting, noise, and blur. In this work,
we propose an Attention-guided Progressive Neural Texture Fusion (APNT-Fusion)
HDR restoration model which aims to address these issues within one framework.
An efficient two-stream structure is proposed which separately focuses on
texture feature transfer over saturated regions and multi-exposure tonal and
texture feature fusion. A neural feature transfer mechanism is proposed which
establishes spatial correspondence between different exposures based on
multi-scale VGG features in the masked saturated HDR domain for discriminative
contextual clues over the ambiguous image areas. A progressive texture blending
module is designed to blend the encoded two-stream features in a multi-scale
and progressive manner. In addition, we introduce several novel attention
mechanisms, i.e., the motion attention module detects and suppresses the
content discrepancies among the reference images; the saturation attention
module facilitates differentiating the misalignment caused by saturation from
those caused by motion; and the scale attention module ensures texture blending
consistency between different coder/decoder scales. We carry out comprehensive
qualitative and quantitative evaluations and ablation studies, which validate
that these novel modules work coherently under the same framework and
outperform state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

In particular, we observe that MaskFormer outperforms per-pixel classification

unsupervised domain generalization, which aims to learn generalizable models
with unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose a Domain-Irrelevant Unsupervised
Learning (DIUL) method to cope with the significant and misleading
heterogeneity within unlabeled data and severe distribution shifts between
source and target data. Surprisingly we observe that DIUL can not only
counterbalance the scarcity of labeled data but also further strengthen the
generalization ability of models when the labeled data are sufficient. As a
pretraining approach, DIUL shows superior to ImageNet pretraining protocol even
when the available data are unlabeled and of a greatly smaller amount compared
to ImageNet. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method compared with state-of-the-art unsupervised learning counterparts.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent works on plug-and-play image restoration have shown that a denoiser
can implicitly serve as the image prior for model-based methods to solve many
inverse problems. Such a property induces considerable advantages for
plug-and-play image restoration (e.g., integrating the flexibility of
model-based method and effectiveness of learning-based methods) when the
denoiser is discriminatively learned via deep convolutional neural network
(CNN) with large modeling capacity. However, while deeper and larger CNN models
are rapidly gaining popularity, existing plug-and-play image restoration
hinders its performance due to the lack of suitable denoiser prior. In order to
push the limits of plug-and-play image restoration, we set up a benchmark deep
denoiser prior by training a highly flexible and effective CNN denoiser. We
then plug the deep denoiser prior as a modular part into a half quadratic
splitting based iterative algorithm to solve various image restoration
problems. We, meanwhile, provide a thorough analysis of parameter setting,
intermediate results and empirical convergence to better understand the working
mechanism. Experimental results on three representative image restoration
tasks, including deblurring, super-resolution and demosaicing, demonstrate that
the proposed plug-and-play image restoration with deep denoiser prior not only
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art model-based methods but also
achieves competitive or even superior performance against state-of-the-art
learning-based methods. The source code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite the remarkable successes of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
computer vision, it is time-consuming and error-prone to manually design a CNN.
Among various Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods that are motivated to
automate designs of high-performance CNNs, the differentiable NAS and
population-based NAS are attracting increasing interests due to their unique
characters. To benefit from the merits while overcoming the deficiencies of
both, this work proposes a novel NAS method, RelativeNAS. As the key to
efficient search, RelativeNAS performs joint learning between fast-learners
(i.e. networks with relatively higher accuracy) and slow-learners in a pairwise
manner. Moreover, since RelativeNAS only requires low-fidelity performance
estimation to distinguish each pair of fast-learner and slow-learner, it saves
certain computation costs for training the candidate architectures. The
proposed RelativeNAS brings several unique advantages: (1) it achieves
state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet with top-1 error rate of 24.88%, i.e.
outperforming DARTS and AmoebaNet-B by 1.82% and 1.12% respectively; (2) it
spends only nine hours with a single 1080Ti GPU to obtain the discovered cells,
i.e. 3.75x and 7875x faster than DARTS and AmoebaNet respectively; (3) it
provides that the discovered cells obtained on CIFAR-10 can be directly
transferred to object detection, semantic segmentation, and keypoint detection,
yielding competitive results of 73.1% mAP on PASCAL VOC, 78.7% mIoU on
Cityscapes, and 68.5% AP on MSCOCO, respectively. The implementation of
RelativeNAS is available at https://github.com/EMI-Group/RelativeNAS]]></summary>

source model degrades when bumping into the high data density near decision
boundary in target domain. A common solution is to minimize the Shannon Entropy
to push the decision boundary away from the high density area. However, entropy
minimization also leads to severe reduction of prediction diversity, and
unfortunately brings harm to the domain adaptation. In this paper, we
investigate the prediction discriminability and diversity by studying the
structure of the classification output matrix of a randomly selected data
batch. We find by theoretical analysis that the prediction discriminability and
diversity could be separately measured by the Frobenius-norm and rank of the
batch output matrix. The nuclear-norm is an upperbound of the former, and a
convex approximation of the latter. Accordingly, we propose Batch Nuclear-norm
Maximization and Minimization, which performs nuclear-norm maximization on the
target output matrix to enhance the target prediction ability, and nuclear-norm
minimization on the source batch output matrix to increase applicability of the
source domain knowledge. We further approximate the nuclear-norm by
L_{1,2}-norm, and design multi-batch optimization for stable solution on large
number of categories. The fast approximation method achieves O(n^2)
computational complexity and better convergence property. Experiments show that
our method could boost the adaptation accuracy and robustness under three
typical domain adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

in which the ratings are continuous values. In contrast to original triplet
loss where we have to sample data carefully, in out method, we can generate
triplets using the whole dataset, and the optimization can still converge
without frequently running into a model collapsing issue. The adaptive margins
only need to be computed once before the training, which is much less expensive
than generating triplets after every epoch as in the fixed margin case. Besides
substantially improved training stability (the proposed model never collapsed
in our experiments compared to a couple of times that the training collapsed on
existing triplet loss), we achieved slightly better performance than the
original triplet loss on various rating datasets and network architectures.]]></summary>

intuition about image quality metrics, available reference datasets, and SR
challenges. Deep learning-based approaches of SR are evaluated using a

include the enhanced deep SR network (EDSR), cycle-in-cycle GAN (CinCGAN),
multiscale residual network (MSRN), meta residual dense network (Meta-RDN),
recurrent back-projection network (RBPN), second-order attention network (SAN),

Our approach simplifies the current pipeline that depends heavily on surrogate

area experts, they fail to comprehensively solve the target task. By contrast,

is necessary for an agent to exploit its observation history in the considered
place and efficiently reach known goals. This ability can be associated with
spatial reasoning, where an agent is able to perceive spatial relationships and
regularities, and discover object affordances. In classical Reinforcement
Learning (RL) setups, this capacity is learned from reward alone. We introduce
supplementary supervision in the form of auxiliary tasks designed to favor the
emergence of spatial perception capabilities in agents trained for a
goal-reaching downstream objective. We show that learning to estimate metrics
quantifying the spatial relationships between an agent at a given location and
a goal to reach has a high positive impact in Multi-Object Navigation settings.
Our method significantly improves the performance of different baseline agents,

(HAT) for image-based person Re-ID with high performance. To achieve this goal,
we first propose a Deeply Supervised Aggregation (DSA) to recurrently aggregate
hierarchical features from CNN backbones. With multi-granularity supervisions,
the DSA can enhance multi-scale features for person retrieval, which is very
different from previous methods. Then, we introduce a Transformer-based Feature
Calibration (TFC) to integrate low-level detail information as the global prior
for high-level semantic information. The proposed TFC is inserted to each level
of hierarchical features, resulting in great performance improvements. To our
best knowledge, this work is the first to take advantages of both CNNs and
Transformers for image-based person Re-ID. Comprehensive experiments on four
large-scale Re-ID benchmarks demonstrate that our method shows better results
than several state-of-the-art methods. The code is released at

and witnessed rapid development with the popularity of deep learning
algorithms. Nevertheless, existing approaches often obtain inaccurate detection
results, mainly due to the relatively weak ability to utilize context
information and the inappropriate choice of offset references. This paper
presents a novel text instance expression which integrates both foreground and
background information into the pipeline, and naturally uses the pixels near
text boundaries as the offset starts. Besides, a corresponding post-processing
algorithm is also designed to sequentially combine the four prediction results
and reconstruct the text instance accurately. We evaluate our method on several
challenging scene text benchmarks, including both curved and multi-oriented
text datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach
obtains superior or competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art

no other work on thermal-optical grayscale fusion. Our method is also unique in

Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) domain instead of the gray level domain. As a
part of this work, we also present a new and unique database for obtaining the
region of interest in thermal images based on an existing thermal visual paired
database, containing the Region of Interest on 5 different classes of data.
Finally, we are proposing a simple low cost overhead statistical measure for
identifying the region of interest in the fused images, which we call as the
Region of Fusion (RoF). Experiments on the database show encouraging results in
identifying the region of interest in the fused images. We also show that they

shows that it is possible to learn a catalog that allows local semantic
transfers of facial features on generated images by capitalizing on the
disentanglement property of the StyleGAN latent space. RIS improves existing
art on: 1) feature disentanglement and allows for challenging transfers (i.e.,
hair and pose) that were not shown possible in SoTA methods. 2) eliminating the
need for per-image hyperparameter tuning, and for computing a catalog over a
large batch of images. 3) enabling face retrieval using the proposed facial
features (e.g., eyes), and to our best knowledge, is the first work to retrieve
face images at the fine-grained level. 4) robustness and natural application to
real images. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses show RIS achieves both
high-fidelity feature transfers and accurate fine-grained retrievals on real

Embolism (PE) is among the most fatal cardiovascular diseases. It is caused by
an artery blockage in the lung; confirming its presence is time-consuming and

is critical for diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. In this study we propose a
two-stage attention-based CNN-LSTM network for predicting PE, its associated

central) on computed tomography (CT) examinations. We trained our model on the
largest available public Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram PE dataset
(RSNA-STR Pulmonary Embolism CT (RSPECT) Dataset, N=7279 CT studies) and tested
it on an in-house curated dataset of N=106 studies. Our framework mirrors the
radiologic diagnostic process via a multi-slice approach so that the accuracy
and pathologic sequela of true pulmonary emboli may be meticulously assessed,
enabling physicians to better appraise the morbidity of a PE when present. Our
proposed method outperformed a baseline CNN classifier and a single-stage

several retrieval systems have been developed depending on the type of data

search for 3D models is non-trivial. Among 3D models, retrieving 3D
Engineering/CAD models or mechanical components is even more challenging due to
the presence of holes, volumetric features, presence of sharp edges etc., which
make CAD a domain unto itself. The research work presented in this paper aims
at developing a dataset suitable for building a retrieval system for 3D CAD
models based on deep learning. 3D CAD models from the available CAD databases
are collected, and a dataset of computer-generated sketch data, termed
'CADSketchNet', has been prepared. Additionally, hand-drawn sketches of the
components are also added to CADSketchNet. Using the sketch images from this
dataset, the paper also aims at evaluating the performance of various retrieval
system or a search engine for 3D CAD models that accepts a sketch image as the

duality gap. This poses a challenge when applying them directly to nonconvex
problems such as MAP-inference in a Markov random field (MRF) with continuous

the original nonconvex task in the space of measures. This infinite-dimensional
reformulation is then approximated by a semi-infinite one, which is obtained
via a piecewise polynomial discretization in the dual. We provide a geometric
intuition behind the primal problem induced by the dual discretization and draw
connections to optimization over moment spaces. In contrast to existing
discretizations which suffer from a grid bias, we show that a piecewise
polynomial discretization better preserves the continuous nature of our
problem. Invoking results from optimal transport theory and convex algebraic
geometry we reduce the semi-infinite program to a finite one and provide a
practical implementation based on semidefinite programming. We show,
experimentally and in theory, that the approach successfully reduces the

RetinaNet (GPS-RetinaNet), which predicts a positional offset for each sign
relative to the camera, in addition to performing the standard classification
and bounding box regression. Candidate sign detections from GPS-RetinaNet are
condensed into geolocalized signs by our custom tracker, which consists of a
learned metric network and a variant of the Hungarian Algorithm. Our metric
network estimates the similarity between pairs of detections, then the
Hungarian Algorithm matches detections across images using the similarity
scores provided by the metric network. Our models were trained using an updated
version of the ARTS dataset, which contains 25,544 images and 47.589 sign
annotations ~\cite{arts}. The proposed dataset covers a diverse set of
environments gathered from a broad selection of roads. Each annotaiton contains
a sign class label, its geospatial location, an assembly label, a side of road

explaining the Alzheimer's diagnosis made by a DNN from the 3D point cloud of
the neuroanatomy and tabular biomarkers. Our explanations are based on the
Shapley value, which is the unique method that satisfies all fundamental axioms
for local explanations previously established in the literature. Thus, SVEHNN
has many desirable characteristics that previous work on interpretability for
medical decision making is lacking. To avoid the exponential time complexity of
the Shapley value, we propose to transform a given DNN into a Lightweight
Probabilistic Deep Network without re-training, thus achieving a complexity
only quadratic in the number of features. In our experiments on synthetic and
real data, we show that we can closely approximate the exact Shapley value with
a dramatically reduced runtime and can reveal the hidden knowledge the network
has learned from the data.]]></summary>

essential role in various computer vision tasks. Many realistic and synthetic
datasets have been proposed to address different problems. However, there are
lots of unresolved challenges: (1) the creation of dataset is usually a tedious
process with manual annotations, (2) most datasets are only designed for a
single specific task, (3) the modification or randomization of the 3D scene is
difficult, and (4) the release of commercial 3D data may encounter copyright
issue.

This paper presents MINERVAS, a Massive INterior EnviRonments VirtuAl
Synthesis system, to facilitate the 3D scene modification and the 2D image
synthesis for various vision tasks. In particular, we design a programmable
pipeline with Domain-Specific Language, allowing users to (1) select scenes
from the commercial indoor scene database, (2) synthesize scenes for different
tasks with customized rules, and (3) render various imagery data, such as
visual color, geometric structures, semantic label. Our system eases the
difficulty of customizing massive numbers of scenes for different tasks and
relieves users from manipulating fine-grained scene configurations by providing
user-controllable randomness using multi-level samplers. Most importantly, it
empowers users to access commercial scene databases with millions of indoor
scenes and protects the copyright of core data assets, e.g., 3D CAD models. We
demonstrate the validity and flexibility of our system by using our synthesized
data to improve the performance on different kinds of computer vision tasks.]]></summary>

generative adversarial learning. KDD GAN formulates the training as a
likelihood ratio optimization problem where the data distributions are written
explicitly via (local) Kernel Density Estimates (KDE). This is inspired by the
recent progress in contrastive learning and its relation to KDE. We define the
KDEs directly in feature space and forgo the requirement of invertibility of
the kernel feature mappings. In our approach, features are no longer optimized
for linear separability, as in the original GAN formulation, but for the more
general discrimination of distributions in the feature space. We analyze the
gradient of our loss with respect to the feature representation and show that
it is better behaved than that of the original hinge loss. We perform
experiments with the proposed KDE-based loss, used either as a training loss or
a regularization term, on both CIFAR10 and scaled versions of ImageNet. We use
BigGAN/SA-GAN as a backbone and baseline, since our focus is not to design the
architecture of the networks. We show a boost in the quality of generated
samples with respect to FID from 10% to 40% compared to the baseline. Code will

classification, especially via pretraining on source data and fine-tuning on
target data. There is currently no consensus on how to choose appropriate
source data, and in the literature we can find both evidence of favoring large
natural image datasets such as ImageNet, and evidence of favoring more
specialized medical datasets. In this paper we perform a systematic study with
nine source datasets with natural or medical images, and three target medical
datasets, all with 2D images. We find that ImageNet is the source leading to
the highest performances, but also that larger datasets are not necessarily
better. We also study different definitions of data similarity. We show that
common intuitions about similarity may be inaccurate, and therefore not
sufficient to predict an appropriate source a priori. Finally, we discuss
several steps needed for further research in this field, especially with regard
to other types (for example 3D) medical images. Our experiments and pretrained

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a pervasive yet challenging problem,
since: 1) low-light measurements may vary due to different imaging conditions
in practice; 2) images can be enlightened subjectively according to diverse
preferences by each individual. To tackle these two challenges, this paper
presents a novel deep reinforcement learning based method, dubbed ReLLIE, for
customized low-light enhancement. ReLLIE models LLIE as a markov decision
process, i.e., estimating the pixel-wise image-specific curves sequentially and
recurrently. Given the reward computed from a set of carefully crafted
non-reference loss functions, a lightweight network is proposed to estimate the
curves for enlightening of a low-light image input. As ReLLIE learns a policy
instead of one-one image translation, it can handle various low-light
measurements and provide customized enhanced outputs by flexibly applying the
policy different times. Furthermore, ReLLIE can enhance real-world images with
hybrid corruptions, e.g., noise, by using a plug-and-play denoiser easily.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of
ReLLIE, comparing to the state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

parametric human mesh to images of obese people. Despite obese person mesh
fitting being an important problem with numerous applications (e.g.,
healthcare), much recent progress in mesh recovery has been restricted to
images of non-obese people. In this work, we identify this crucial gap in the
current literature by presenting and discussing limitations of existing
algorithms. Next, we present a simple baseline to address this problem that is
scalable and can be easily used in conjunction with existing algorithms to
improve their performance. Finally, we present a generalized human mesh
optimization algorithm that substantially improves the performance of existing
methods on both obese person images as well as community-standard benchmark
datasets. A key innovation of this technique is that it does not rely on
supervision from expensive-to-create mesh parameters. Instead, starting from
widely and cheaply available 2D keypoints annotations, our method automatically
generates mesh parameters that can in turn be used to re-train and fine-tune
any existing mesh estimation algorithm. This way, we show our method acts as a
drop-in to improve the performance of a wide variety of contemporary mesh
estimation methods. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scene text detection remains a grand challenge due to the variation in text
curvatures, orientations, and aspect ratios. One of the most intractable
problems is how to represent text instances of arbitrary shapes. Although many
state-of-the-art methods have been proposed to model irregular texts in a
flexible manner, most of them lose simplicity and robustness. Their complicated
post-processings and the regression under Dirac delta distribution undermine
the detection performance and the generalization ability. In this paper, we
propose an efficient text instance representation named CentripetalText (CT),
which decomposes text instances into the combination of text kernels and
centripetal shifts. Specifically, we utilize the centripetal shifts to
implement the pixel aggregation, which guide the external text pixels to the
internal text kernels. The relaxation operation is integrated into the dense
regression for centripetal shifts, allowing the correct prediction in a range,
not a specific value. The convenient reconstruction of the text contours and
the tolerance of the prediction errors in our method guarantee the high
detection accuracy and the fast inference speed respectively. Besides, we
shrink our text detector into a proposal generation module, namely
CentripetalText Proposal Network (CPN), replacing SPN in Mask TextSpotter v3
and producing more accurate proposals. To validate the effectiveness of our
designs, we conduct experiments on several commonly used scene text benchmarks,
including both curved and multi-oriented text datasets. For the task of scene
text detection, our approach achieves superior or competitive performance
compared to other existing methods, e.g., F-measure of 86.3% at 40.0 FPS on
Total-Text, F-measure of 86.1% at 34.8 FPS on MSRA-TD500, etc. For the task of
end-to-end scene text recognition, we outperform Mask TextSpotter v3 by 1.1% on
Total-Text.]]></summary>

biological and clinical analysis, enabling the study of cellular expression
patterns and cell lineages. However, current datasets for neuronal nuclei
usually contain volumes smaller than $10^{\text{-}3}\ mm^3$ with fewer than 500
instances per volume, unable to reveal the complexity in large brain regions
and restrict the investigation of neuronal structures. In this paper, we have
pushed the task forward to the sub-cubic millimeter scale and curated the NucMM
dataset with two fully annotated volumes: one $0.1\ mm^3$ electron microscopy
(EM) volume containing nearly the entire zebrafish brain with around 170,000
nuclei; and one $0.25\ mm^3$ micro-CT (uCT) volume containing part of a mouse
visual cortex with about 7,000 nuclei. With two imaging modalities and
significantly increased volume size and instance numbers, we discover a great
diversity of neuronal nuclei in appearance and density, introducing new
challenges to the field. We also perform a statistical analysis to illustrate
those challenges quantitatively. To tackle the challenges, we propose a novel
hybrid-representation learning model that combines the merits of foreground
mask, contour map, and signed distance transform to produce high-quality 3D
masks. The benchmark comparisons on the NucMM dataset show that our proposed
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art nuclei segmentation

medical therapy. Solutions for automated epileptic seizure detection can help
improve the current problem of incomplete and erroneous manual documentation of
epileptic seizures. In recent years, a number of wearable sensors have been
tested for this purpose. However, detecting seizures with subtle symptoms
remains difficult and current solutions tend to have a high false alarm rate.
Seizures can also affect the patient's arterial blood pressure, which has not
yet been studied for detection with sensors. The pulse transit time (PTT)
provides a noninvasive estimate of arterial blood pressure. It can be obtained
by using to two sensors, which are measuring the time differences between
arrivals of the pulse waves. Due to separated time chips a clock drift emerges,
which is strongly influencing the PTT. In this work, we present an algorithm
which responds to alterations in the PTT, considering the clock drift and
enabling the noninvasive monitoring of blood pressure alterations using
separated sensors. Furthermore we investigated whether seizures can be detected
using the PTT. Our results indicate that using the algorithm, it is possible to
detect seizures with a Random Forest. Using the PTT along with other signals in
a multimodal approach, the detection of seizures with subtle symptoms could
thereby be improved.]]></summary>

vision and machine learning in the e-commerce domain. Since the number of

recognition, where there are many products with slight or subtle visual
differences. It has always been a challenge to create a benchmark dataset for
training and evaluation on various visual search solutions in a real-world
setting. This motivated creation of eProduct, a dataset consisting of 2.5
million product images towards accelerating development in the areas of
self-supervised learning, weakly-supervised learning, and multimodal learning,
for fine-grained recognition. We present eProduct as a training set and an
evaluation set, where the training set contains 1.3M+ listing images with
titles and hierarchical category labels, for model development, and the
evaluation set includes 10,000 query and 1.1 million index images for visual

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) when being trained to generate images.
To perform real image editing, it requires an accurate mapping from the real
image to the latent space to leveraging these learned semantics, which is
important yet difficult. An in-domain GAN inversion approach is recently
proposed to constraint the inverted code within the latent space by forcing the
reconstructed image obtained from the inverted code within the real image
space. Empirically, we find that the inverted code by the in-domain GAN can
deviate from the latent space significantly. To solve this problem, we propose
a force-in-domain GAN based on the in-domain GAN, which utilizes a
discriminator to force the inverted code within the latent space. The
force-in-domain GAN can also be interpreted by a cycle-GAN with slight
modification. Extensive experiments show that our force-in-domain GAN not only
reconstructs the target image at the pixel level, but also align the inverted
code with the latent space well for semantic editing.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The goal of representation learning is different from the ultimate objective
of machine learning such as decision making, it is therefore very difficult to
establish clear and direct objectives for training representation learning
models. It has been argued that a good representation should disentangle the
underlying variation factors, yet how to translate this into training
objectives remains unknown. This paper presents an attempt to establish direct
training criterions and design principles for developing good representation
learning models. We propose that a good representation learning model should be
maximally expressive, i.e., capable of distinguishing the maximum number of
input configurations. We formally define expressiveness and introduce the
maximum expressiveness (MEXS) theorem of a general learning model. We propose
to train a model by maximizing its expressiveness while at the same time
incorporating general priors such as model smoothness. We present a conscience
competitive learning algorithm which encourages the model to reach its MEXS
whilst at the same time adheres to model smoothness prior. We also introduce a
label consistent training (LCT) technique to boost model smoothness by
encouraging it to assign consistent labels to similar samples. We present
extensive experimental results to show that our method can indeed design
representation learning models capable of developing representations that are
as good as or better than state of the art. We also show that our technique is
computationally efficient, robust against different parameter settings and can
work effectively on a variety of datasets.]]></summary>

researchers' attention in a decade. However, occlusion will occur for MER in
real-world scenarios. This paper deeply investigates an interesting but
unexplored challenging issue in MER, \ie, occlusion MER. First, to research MER
under real-world occlusion, synthetic occluded micro-expression databases are
created by using various mask for the community. Second, to suppress the
influence of occlusion, a \underline{R}egion-inspired \underline{R}elation
\underline{R}easoning \underline{N}etwork (\textbf{RRRN}) is proposed to model
relations between various facial regions. RRRN consists of a backbone network,
the Region-Inspired (\textbf{RI}) module and Relation Reasoning (\textbf{RR})
module. More specifically, the backbone network aims at extracting feature
representations from different facial regions, RI module computing an adaptive
weight from the region itself based on attention mechanism with respect to the
unobstructedness and importance for suppressing the influence of occlusion, and
RR module exploiting the progressive interactions among these regions by
performing graph convolutions. Experiments are conducted on handout-database
evaluation and composite database evaluation tasks of MEGC 2018 protocol.
Experimental results show that RRRN can significantly explore the importance of
facial regions and capture the cooperative complementary relationship of facial
regions for MER. The results also demonstrate RRRN outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches, especially on occlusion, and RRRN acts more robust

(IoT) and mobile networks) and databases (e.g., nutrition tables and food
compositional databases) in the food system generates massive information silos
due to the well-known data harmonization problem. The food knowledge graph
provides a unified and standardized conceptual terminology and their
relationships in a structured form and thus can transform these information
silos across the whole food system to a more reusable globally digitally
connected Internet of Food, enabling every stage of the food system from
farm-to-fork.

Scope and approach: We review the evolution of food knowledge organization,
from food classification, food ontology to food knowledge graphs. We then
discuss the progress in food knowledge graphs from several representative
applications. We finally discuss the main challenges and future directions.

Key findings and conclusions: Our comprehensive summary of current research
on food knowledge graphs shows that food knowledge graphs play an important
role in food-oriented applications, including food search and Question
Answering (QA), personalized dietary recommendation, food analysis and
visualization, food traceability, and food machinery intelligent manufacturing.
Future directions for food knowledge graphs cover several fields such as

studies have shown theirvulnerability to adversarial examples (AEs), i.e.,
care-fully perturbed inputs designed to fool the targetedDNN. Currently, the
literature is rich with many ef-fective attacks to craft such AEs. Meanwhile,
many de-fenses strategies have been developed to mitigate thisvulnerability.
However, these latter showed their effec-tiveness against specific attacks and
does not general-ize well to different attacks. In this paper, we proposea
framework for defending DNN classifier against ad-versarial samples. The
proposed method is based on atwo-stage framework involving a separate detector
anda denoising block. The detector aims to detect AEs bycharacterizing them
through the use of natural scenestatistic (NSS), where we demonstrate that
these statis-tical features are altered by the presence of
adversarialperturbations. The denoiser is based on block matching3D (BM3D)
filter fed by an optimum threshold valueestimated by a convolutional neural
network (CNN) toproject back the samples detected as AEs into theirdata
manifold. We conducted a complete evaluation onthree standard datasets namely
MNIST, CIFAR-10 andTiny-ImageNet. The experimental results show that
theproposed defense method outperforms the state-of-the-art defense techniques
by improving the robustnessagainst a set of attacks under black-box, gray-box
and white-box settings. The source code is available at:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[High-capacity image steganography, aimed at concealing a secret image in a
cover image, is a technique to preserve sensitive data, e.g., faces and
fingerprints. Previous methods focus on the security during transmission and
subsequently run a risk of privacy leakage after the restoration of secret
images at the receiving end. To address this issue, we propose a framework,
called Multitask Identity-Aware Image Steganography (MIAIS), to achieve direct
recognition on container images without restoring secret images. The key issue
of the direct recognition is to preserve identity information of secret images
into container images and make container images look similar to cover images at
the same time. Thus, we introduce a simple content loss to preserve the
identity information, and design a minimax optimization to deal with the
contradictory aspects. We demonstrate that the robustness results can be
transferred across different cover datasets. In order to be flexible for the
secret image restoration in some cases, we incorporate an optional restoration
network into our method, providing a multitask framework. The experiments under
the multitask scenario show the effectiveness of our framework compared with
other visual information hiding methods and state-of-the-art high-capacity
image steganography methods.]]></summary>

fully connected Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), we decompose it into local

implemented by attention mechanisms with projection matrices. We observe that
the unary terms only make small contributions to the outputs, and meanwhile
standard CNNs that rely solely on the unary terms achieve great performances on
a variety of tasks. Therefore, we propose Locally Enhanced Self-Attention
(LESA), which enhances the unary term by incorporating it with convolutions,
and utilizes a fusion module to dynamically couple the unary and binary
operations. In our experiments, we replace the self-attention modules with
LESA. The results on ImageNet and COCO show the superiority of LESA over

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Human vision is able to capture the part-whole hierarchical information from
the entire scene. This paper presents the Visual Parser (ViP) that explicitly
constructs such a hierarchy with transformers. ViP divides visual
representations into two levels, the part level and the whole level.
Information of each part represents a combination of several independent
vectors within the whole. To model the representations of the two levels, we
first encode the information from the whole into part vectors through an
attention mechanism, then decode the global information within the part vectors
back into the whole representation. By iteratively parsing the two levels with
the proposed encoder-decoder interaction, the model can gradually refine the
features on both levels. Experimental results demonstrate that ViP can achieve
very competitive performance on three major tasks e.g. classification,
detection and instance segmentation. In particular, it can surpass the previous
state-of-the-art CNN backbones by a large margin on object detection. The tiny
model of the ViP family with $7.2\times$ fewer parameters and $10.9\times$
fewer FLOPS can perform comparably with the largest model
ResNeXt-101-64$\times$4d of ResNe(X)t family. Visualization results also
demonstrate that the learnt parts are highly informative of the predicting
class, making ViP more explainable than previous fundamental architectures.

multiple knowledge sequentially, and a growing number of approaches have been
proposed to mitigate this problem. Some of these methods achieved considerable
performance by associating the flat local minima with forgetting mitigation in
continual learning. However, they inevitably need (1) tedious hyperparameters
tuning, and (2) additional computational cost. To alleviate these problems, in
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective optimization method, called
AlterSGD, to search for a flat minima in the loss landscape. In AlterSGD, we
conduct gradient descent and ascent alternatively when the network tends to
converge at each session of learning new knowledge. Moreover, we theoretically
prove that such a strategy can encourage the optimization to converge to a flat
minima. We verify AlterSGD on continual learning benchmark for semantic
segmentation and the empirical results show that we can significantly mitigate
the forgetting and outperform the state-of-the-art methods with a large margin

one hand, they facilitate innovation at companies, but on the other, they are
unlikely to be automated soon. Researchers struggle with accurately approaching
quantitatively the study of soft skills due to the lack of data-driven methods
to retrieve them. This limits the possibility for psychologists and HR managers
to understand the relation between humans and digitalisation. This paper
presents SkillNER, a novel data-driven method for automatically extracting soft
skills from text. It is a named entity recognition (NER) system trained with a
support vector machine (SVM) on a corpus of more than 5000 scientific papers.
We developed this system by measuring the performance of our approach against
different training models and validating the results together with a team of
psychologists. Finally, SkillNER was tested in a real-world case study using
the job descriptions of ESCO (European Skill/Competence Qualification and
Occupation) as textual source. The system enabled the detection of communities
of job profiles based on their shared soft skills and communities of soft
skills based on their shared job profiles. This case study demonstrates that
the tool can automatically retrieve soft skills from a large corpus in an
efficient way, proving useful for firms, institutions, and workers. The tool is

multiparty dialogue and suggests two new tasks for more comprehensive
predictions of personal entities in daily conversations. We first demonstrate
that there are substantial limitations to the evaluation methods of previous
work, namely that randomized assignment of samples to training and test data
substantially decreases the complexity of cloze-style reading comprehension.
According to our analysis, replacing the random data split with a chronological
data split reduces test accuracy on previous single-variable passage completion
task from 72\% to 34\%, that leaves much more room to improve. Our proposed
tasks extend the previous single-variable passage completion task by replacing
more character mentions with variables. Several deep learning models are
developed to validate these three tasks. A thorough error analysis is provided
to understand the challenges and guide the future direction of this research.]]></summary>

feedback between layers, are often biologically implausible, and are vulnerable
to adversarial attacks that humans are not susceptible to. On the other hand,
Hebbian learning in winner-take-all (WTA) networks, is unsupervised,
feed-forward, and biologically plausible. However, an objective optimization
theory for WTA networks has been missing, except under very limiting
assumptions. Here we derive formally such a theory, based on biologically
plausible but generic ANN elements. Through Hebbian learning, network
parameters maintain a Bayesian generative model of the data. There is no
supervisory loss function, but the network does minimize cross-entropy between
its activations and the input distribution. The key is a "soft" WTA where there
is no absolute "hard" winner neuron, and a specific type of Hebbian-like
plasticity of weights and biases. We confirm our theory in practice, where, in
handwritten digit (MNIST) recognition, our Hebbian algorithm, SoftHebb,
minimizes cross-entropy without having access to it, and outperforms the more
frequently used, hard-WTA-based method. Strikingly, it even outperforms
supervised end-to-end backpropagation, under certain conditions. Specifically,
in a two-layered network, SoftHebb outperforms backpropagation when the
training dataset is only presented once, when the testing data is noisy, and
under gradient-based adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks that confuse
SoftHebb are also confusing to the human eye. Finally, the model can generate
interpolations of objects from its input distribution.]]></summary>

introduced, many extensions to the model have been proposed, ranging from using
higher-order inference to directly optimizing evaluation metrics using

to the original model. Motivated by this observation and the recent advances in
pre-trained Transformer language models, we propose a simple yet effective
baseline for coreference resolution. Our model is a simplified version of the
original neural coreference resolution model, however, it achieves impressive

capabilities, including zero and few-shot translation between low-resource
language pairs. However, these models are often evaluated on high-resource
languages with the assumption that they generalize to low-resource ones. The
difficulty of evaluating MT models on low-resource pairs is often due to lack
of standardized evaluation datasets. In this paper, we present MENYO-20k, the
first multi-domain parallel corpus with a special focus on clean orthography
for Yor\`ub\'a--English with standardized train-test splits for benchmarking.
We provide several neural MT benchmarks and compare them to the performance of
popular pre-trained (massively multilingual) MT models both for the
heterogeneous test set and its subdomains. Since these pre-trained models use
huge amounts of data with uncertain quality, we also analyze the effect of
diacritics, a major characteristic of Yor\`ub\'a, in the training data. We
investigate how and when this training condition affects the final quality and
intelligibility of a translation. Our models outperform massively multilingual
models such as Google ($+8.7$ BLEU) and Facebook M2M ($+9.1$ BLEU) when
translating to Yor\`ub\'a, setting a high quality benchmark for future

understanding (NLU) challenges, the majority of this progress remains to be
concentrated on resource-rich languages like English. This work focuses on
Persian language, one of the widely spoken languages in the world, and yet
there are few NLU datasets available for this rich language. The availability

first benchmark in Persian language that includes a range of high-level tasks
-- Reading Comprehension, Textual Entailment, etc. These datasets are collected
in a multitude of ways, often involving manual annotations by native speakers.
This results in over 14.5$k$ new instances across 6 distinct NLU tasks.
Besides, we present the first results on state-of-the-art monolingual and
multi-lingual pre-trained language-models on this benchmark and compare them
with human performance, which provides valuable insights into our ability to
tackle natural language understanding challenges in Persian. We hope ParsiNLU

displacements in a scene with heterogeneous motion dynamics, occlusion, and
scene homogeneity. Traditional approaches to handle these challenges include
hierarchical and multiresolution processing methods. Learning-based optical
flow methods typically use a multiresolution approach with image warping when a
broad range of flow velocities and heterogeneous motion is present. Accuracy of
such coarse-to-fine methods is affected by the ghosting artifacts when images
are warped across multiple resolutions and by the vanishing problem in smaller
scene extents with higher motion contrast. Previously, we devised strategies
for building compact dense prediction networks guided by the effective
receptive field (ERF) characteristics of the network (DDCNet). The DDCNet
design was intentionally simple and compact allowing it to be used as a
building block for designing more complex yet compact networks. In this work,
we extend the DDCNet strategies to handle heterogeneous motion dynamics by
cascading DDCNet based sub-nets with decreasing extents of their ERF. Our
DDCNet with multiresolution capability (DDCNet-Multires) is compact without any
specialized network layers. We evaluate the performance of the DDCNet-Multires
network using standard optical flow benchmark datasets. Our experiments
demonstrate that DDCNet-Multires improves over the DDCNet-B0 and -B1 and
provides optical flow estimates with accuracy comparable to similar lightweight
learning-based methods.]]></summary>

distributions of data. Both the generators and discriminators of GANs are often
modeled by neural networks, posing a non-transparent optimization problem which
is non-convex and non-concave over the generator and discriminator,
respectively. Such networks are often heuristically optimized with gradient
descent-ascent (GDA), but it is unclear whether the optimization problem
contains any saddle points, or whether heuristic methods can find them in
practice. In this work, we analyze the training of Wasserstein GANs with
two-layer neural network discriminators through the lens of convex duality, and
for a variety of generators expose the conditions under which Wasserstein GANs
can be solved exactly with convex optimization approaches, or can be
represented as convex-concave games. Using this convex duality interpretation,
we further demonstrate the impact of different activation functions of the
discriminator. Our observations are verified with numerical results
demonstrating the power of the convex interpretation, with applications in
progressive training of convex architectures corresponding to linear generators
and quadratic-activation discriminators for CelebA image generation. The code

and requires significant efforts to converse with the claimant. This is a
highly professional job that involves many parts, such as identifying personal
information, collecting related evidence, and making a final insurance report.
Due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the previous offline insurance
assessment has to be conducted online. However, for the junior assessor often
lacking practical experience, it is not easy to quickly handle such a complex
online procedure, yet this is important as the insurance company needs to
decide how much compensation the claimant should receive based on the
assessor's feedback. In order to promote assessors' work efficiency and speed
up the overall procedure, in this paper, we propose a dialogue-based
information extraction system that integrates advanced NLP technologies for
medical insurance assessment. With the assistance of our system, the average
time cost of the procedure is reduced from 55 minutes to 35 minutes, and the
total human resources cost is saved 30% compared with the previous offline
procedure. Until now, the system has already served thousands of online claim
cases.]]></summary>

reliable human-computer interactive systems. However, annotations of large
scale datasets in FER has been a key challenge as these datasets suffer from
noise due to various factors like crowd sourcing, subjectivity of annotators,
poor quality of images, automatic labelling based on key word search etc. Such
noisy annotations impede the performance of FER due to the memorization ability
of deep networks. During early learning stage, deep networks fit on clean data.
Then, eventually, they start overfitting on noisy labels due to their
memorization ability, which limits FER performance. This report presents
Consensual Collaborative Training (CCT) framework used in our submission to
expression recognition track of the Affective Behaviour Analysis in-the-wild
(ABAW) 2021 competition. CCT co-trains three networks jointly using a convex
combination of supervision loss and consistency loss, without making any
assumption about the noise distribution. A dynamic transition mechanism is used
to move from supervision loss in early learning to consistency loss for
consensus of predictions among networks in the later stage. Co-training reduces
overall error, and consistency loss prevents overfitting to noisy samples. The
performance of the model is validated on challenging Aff-Wild2 dataset for
categorical expression classification. Our code is made publicly available at

building with subject-specific regularizations of image registration. We
develop an atlas construction process that automatically selects parameters to
control the smoothness of diffeomorphic transformation according to individual
image data. To achieve this, we introduce a hierarchical prior distribution on
regularization parameters that allows multiple penalties on images with various
degrees of geometric transformations. We then treat the regularization
parameters as latent variables and integrate them out from the model by using
the Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) algorithm. Another advantage of
our algorithm is that it eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning, which
can be tedious and infeasible. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on
3D brain MR images. Experimental results show that our model provides a sharper
atlas compared to the current atlas building algorithms with single-penalty
regularizations. Our code is publicly available at

achieved success on various commonsense reasoning tasks. However, for a given
task instance, the KG, or certain parts of the KG, may not be useful. Although
KG-augmented models often use attention to focus on specific KG components, the
KG is still always used, and the attention mechanism is never explicitly taught
which KG components should be used. Meanwhile, saliency methods can measure how
much a KG feature (e.g., graph, node, path) influences the model to make the
correct prediction, thus explaining which KG features are useful. This paper
explores how saliency explanations can be used to improve KG-augmented models'
performance. First, we propose to create coarse (Is the KG useful?) and fine
(Which nodes/paths in the KG are useful?) saliency explanations. Second, we
propose SalKG, a framework for KG-augmented models to learn from coarse and/or
fine saliency explanations. Given saliency explanations created from a task's
training set, SalKG jointly trains the model to predict the explanations, then
solve the task by attending to KG features highlighted by the predicted
explanations. On two popular commonsense QA benchmarks (CSQA, OBQA), we show
that \textsc{SalKG} models can yield large performance gains -- up to 3.27% on
CSQA.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Transformers provide a class of expressive architectures that are extremely
effective for sequence modeling. However, the key limitation of transformers is
their quadratic memory and time complexity $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ with respect to
the sequence length in attention layers, which restricts application in
extremely long sequences. Most existing approaches leverage sparsity or
low-rank assumptions in the attention matrix to reduce cost, but sacrifice
expressiveness. Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attention
capability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memory
complexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as a
conditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate the
conditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location can
attend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirect
attention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations of
embeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attention
patterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design of
such factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost
($\mathcal{O}(L\log(L))$ or $\mathcal{O}(L\sqrt{L})$). Combiner is a drop-in
replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily
implemented in common frameworks. An experimental evaluation on both
autoregressive and bidirectional sequence tasks demonstrates the effectiveness
of this approach, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text
modeling tasks.]]></summary>

on attention encoder-decoder (AED) architectures which tend to suffer from
over-fitting in low resource scenarios. One solution to tackle this issue is to
generate synthetic data with a trained text-to-speech system (TTS) if
additional text is available. This was successfully applied in many
publications with AED systems, but only very limited in the context of other
ASR architectures. We investigate the effect of varying pre-processing, the
speaker embedding and input encoding of the TTS system w.r.t. the effectiveness
of the synthesized data for AED-ASR training. Additionally, we also consider
internal language model subtraction for the first time, resulting in up to 38%
relative improvement. We compare the AED results to a state-of-the-art hybrid
ASR system, a monophone based system using
connectionist-temporal-classification (CTC) and a monotonic transducer based
system. We show that for the later systems the addition of synthetic data has
no relevant effect, but they still outperform the AED systems on
LibriSpeech-100h. We achieve a final word-error-rate of 3.3%/10.0% with a
hybrid system on the clean/noisy test-sets, surpassing any previous

to state-of-the-art image classifiers. However, real-life scenarios resemble
more the black-box adversarial conditions, lacking transparency and usually
imposing natural, hard constraints on the query budget.

We propose $\textbf{EvoBA}$, a black-box adversarial attack based on a
surprisingly simple evolutionary search strategy. $\textbf{EvoBA}$ is
query-efficient, minimizes $L_0$ adversarial perturbations, and does not
require any form of training.

$\textbf{EvoBA}$ shows efficiency and efficacy through results that are in
line with much more complex state-of-the-art black-box attacks such as
$\textbf{AutoZOOM}$. It is more query-efficient than $\textbf{SimBA}$, a simple
and powerful baseline black-box attack, and has a similar level of complexity.
Therefore, we propose it both as a new strong baseline for black-box
adversarial attacks and as a fast and general tool for gaining empirical
insight into how robust image classifiers are with respect to $L_0$ adversarial
perturbations.

There exist fast and reliable $L_2$ black-box attacks, such as
$\textbf{SimBA}$, and $L_{\infty}$ black-box attacks, such as
$\textbf{DeepSearch}$. We propose $\textbf{EvoBA}$ as a query-efficient $L_0$
black-box adversarial attack which, together with the aforementioned methods,
can serve as a generic tool to assess the empirical robustness of image
classifiers. The main advantages of such methods are that they run fast, are
query-efficient, and can easily be integrated in image classifiers development
pipelines.

While our attack minimises the $L_0$ adversarial perturbation, we also report
$L_2$, and notice that we compare favorably to the state-of-the-art $L_2$
black-box attack, $\textbf{AutoZOOM}$, and of the $L_2$ strong baseline,
$\textbf{SimBA}$.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adapter modules were recently introduced as an efficient alternative to
fine-tuning in NLP. Adapter tuning consists in freezing pretrained parameters
of a model and injecting lightweight modules between layers, resulting in the
addition of only a small number of task-specific trainable parameters. While
adapter tuning was investigated for multilingual neural machine translation,
this paper proposes a comprehensive analysis of adapters for multilingual
speech translation (ST). Starting from different pre-trained models (a
multilingual ST trained on parallel data or a multilingual BART (mBART) trained
on non-parallel multilingual data), we show that adapters can be used to: (a)
efficiently specialize ST to specific language pairs with a low extra cost in
terms of parameters, and (b) transfer from an automatic speech recognition
(ASR) task and an mBART pre-trained model to a multilingual ST task.
Experiments show that adapter tuning offer competitive results to full
fine-tuning, while being much more parameter-efficient.]]></summary>

perspective of having a large amount of separate ASR training data and MT
training data, and a smaller amount of speech-translation training data. Large
amounts of ASR and MT training data are utilized for pre-training the ASR and
MT models. Speech-translation data is used to jointly optimize ASR-MT models by
defining an end-to-end differentiable path from speech to translations. For
this purpose, we use the internal continuous representations from the
ASR-decoder as the input to MT module. We show that speech translation can be
further improved by training the ASR-decoder jointly with the MT-module using
large amount of text-only MT training data. We also show significant
improvements by training an ASR module capable of generating punctuated text,

learning architecture that learns jointly from textual input as well as from

more beneficial than using the broadband signal. Moreover, for a range of word
embedding types, EEG data improves binary and ternary sentiment classification

brains and many state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs). Here, we
investigate whether humans and DNNs allocate attention in comparable ways when
reading a text passage to subsequently answer a specific question. We analyze 3
transformer-based DNNs that reach human-level performance when trained to
perform the reading comprehension task. We find that the DNN attention
distribution quantitatively resembles human attention distribution measured by
fixation times. Human readers fixate longer on words that are more relevant to
the question-answering task, demonstrating that attention is modulated by
top-down reading goals, on top of lower-level visual and text features of the
stimulus. Further analyses reveal that the attention weights in DNNs are also
influenced by both top-down reading goals and lower-level stimulus features,
with the shallow layers more strongly influenced by lower-level text features
and the deep layers attending more to task-relevant words. Additionally, deep
layers' attention to task-relevant words gradually emerges when pre-trained DNN
models are fine-tuned to perform the reading comprehension task, which
coincides with the improvement in task performance. These results demonstrate
that DNNs can evolve human-like attention distribution through task
optimization, which suggests that human attention during goal-directed reading
comprehension is a consequence of task optimization.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Transformer-based end-to-end speech recognition models have received
considerable attention in recent years due to their high training speed and
ability to model a long-range global context. Position embedding in the
transformer architecture is indispensable because it provides supervision for
dependency modeling between elements at different positions in the input
sequence. To make use of the time order of the input sequence, many works
inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the element
into the input sequence. In this work, we investigate various position
embedding methods in the convolution-augmented transformer (conformer) and
adopt a novel implementation named rotary position embedding (RoPE). RoPE
encodes absolute positional information into the input sequence by a rotation
matrix, and then naturally incorporates explicit relative position information
into a self-attention module. To evaluate the effectiveness of the RoPE method,
we conducted experiments on AISHELL-1 and LibriSpeech corpora. Results show
that the conformer enhanced with RoPE achieves superior performance in the
speech recognition task. Specifically, our model achieves a relative word error
rate reduction of 8.70% and 7.27% over the conformer on test-clean and
test-other sets of the LibriSpeech corpus respectively.]]></summary>

pronounced in gender-inflected languages. Bias can appear through associations
of certain adjectives and animate nouns with the natural gender of referents,
but also due to unbalanced grammatical gender frequencies of inflected words.
This type of bias becomes more evident in generating conversational utterances
where gender is not specified within the sentence, because most current NLP
applications still work on a sentence-level context. As a step towards more
inclusive NLP, this paper proposes an automatic and generalisable rewriting
approach for short conversational sentences. The rewriting method can be
applied to sentences that, without extra-sentential context, have multiple
equivalent alternatives in terms of gender. The method can be applied both for
creating gender balanced outputs as well as for creating gender balanced
training data. The proposed approach is based on a neural machine translation
(NMT) system trained to 'translate' from one gender alternative to another.
Both the automatic and manual analysis of the approach show promising results
for automatic generation of gender alternatives for conversational sentences in

investigate whether this class of languages is also more difficult to translate

synthetic languages and a newly introduced translation challenge set, we find
that word order flexibility in the source language only leads to a very small
loss of NMT quality, even though the core verb arguments become impossible to
disambiguate in sentences without semantic cues. The latter issue is indeed
solved by the addition of case marking. However, in medium- and low-resource

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Named entity recognition (NER) is a well-studied task in natural language
processing. Traditional NER research only deals with flat entities and ignores
nested entities. The span-based methods treat entity recognition as a span
classification task. Although these methods have the innate ability to handle
nested NER, they suffer from high computational cost, ignorance of boundary
information, under-utilization of the spans that partially match with entities,
and difficulties in long entity recognition. To tackle these issues, we propose
a two-stage entity identifier. First we generate span proposals by filtering
and boundary regression on the seed spans to locate the entities, and then
label the boundary-adjusted span proposals with the corresponding categories.
Our method effectively utilizes the boundary information of entities and
partially matched spans during training. Through boundary regression, entities
of any length can be covered theoretically, which improves the ability to
recognize long entities. In addition, many low-quality seed spans are filtered
out in the first stage, which reduces the time complexity of inference.
Experiments on nested NER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms previous state-of-the-art models.]]></summary>

into text in another language. Traditional cascaded approaches for ST, using
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) systems, are
prone to error propagation. End-to-end approaches use only one system to avoid
propagating error, yet are difficult to employ due to data scarcity. We explore
zero-shot translation, which enables translating a pair of languages that is
unseen during training, thus avoid the use of end-to-end ST data. Zero-shot
translation has been shown to work for multilingual machine translation, yet
has not been studied for speech translation. We attempt to build zero-shot ST
models that are trained only on ASR and MT tasks but can do ST task during
inference. The challenge is that the representation of text and audio is
significantly different, thus the models learn ASR and MT tasks in different
ways, making it non-trivial to perform zero-shot. These models tend to output
the wrong language when performing zero-shot ST. We tackle the issues by
including additional training data and an auxiliary loss function that
minimizes the text-audio difference. Our experiment results and analysis show
that the methods are promising for zero-shot ST. Moreover, our methods are
particularly useful in the few-shot settings where a limited amount of ST data
is available, with improvements of up to +11.8 BLEU points compared to direct
end-to-end ST models and +3.9 BLEU points compared to ST models fine-tuned from

coordinating with different interlocutors within short conversations. This
ability has been understudied by the research on building neural communicative
agents. We study the task of few-shot $\textit{language coordination}$: agents
quickly adapting to their conversational partners' language abilities.
Different from current communicative agents trained with self-play, we require
the lead agent to coordinate with a $\textit{population}$ of agents with
different linguistic abilities, quickly adapting to communicate with unseen
agents in the population. This requires the ability to model the partner's
beliefs, a vital component of human communication. Drawing inspiration from
theory-of-mind (ToM; Premack& Woodruff (1978)), we study the effect of the
speaker explicitly modeling the listeners' mental states. The speakers, as
shown in our experiments, acquire the ability to predict the reactions of their
partner, which helps it generate instructions that concisely express its
communicative goal. We examine our hypothesis that the instructions generated
with ToM modeling yield better communication performance in both a referential
game and a language navigation task. Positive results from our experiments hint
at the importance of explicitly modeling communication as a socio-pragmatic
progress.]]></summary>

through targeted labeling, enabling significant labeling cost savings. As most
research on active learning has been carried out before transformer-based
language models ("transformers") became popular, despite its practical
importance, comparably few papers have investigated how transformers can be
combined with active learning to date. This can be attributed to the fact that
using state-of-the-art query strategies for transformers induces a prohibitive
runtime overhead, which effectively cancels out, or even outweighs
aforementioned cost savings. In this paper, we revisit uncertainty-based query
strategies, which had been largely outperformed before, but are particularly
suited in the context of fine-tuning transformers. In an extensive evaluation
on five widely used text classification benchmarks, we show that considerable
improvements of up to 14.4 percentage points in area under the learning curve
are achieved, as well as a final accuracy close to the state of the art for all
but one benchmark, using only between 0.4% and 15% of the training data.]]></summary>

promise in recent years because of the simplified model training and deployment
process. Conventional methods either train a universal multilingual model
without taking any language information or with a 1-hot language ID (LID)
vector to guide the recognition of the target language. In practice, the user
can be prompted to pre-select several languages he/she can speak. The
multilingual model without LID cannot well utilize the language information set
by the user while the multilingual model with LID can only handle one
pre-selected language. In this paper, we propose a novel configurable
multilingual model (CMM) which is trained only once but can be configured as
different models based on users' choices by extracting language-specific
modules together with a universal model from the trained CMM. Particularly, a
single CMM can be deployed to any user scenario where the users can pre-select
any combination of languages. Trained with 75K hours of transcribed anonymized
Microsoft multilingual data and evaluated with 10-language test sets, the
proposed CMM improves from the universal multilingual model by 26.0%, 16.9%,
and 10.4% relative word error reduction when the user selects 1, 2, or 3
languages, respectively. CMM also performs significantly better on
code-switching test sets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Transformers provide a class of expressive architectures that are extremely
effective for sequence modeling. However, the key limitation of transformers is
their quadratic memory and time complexity $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ with respect to
the sequence length in attention layers, which restricts application in
extremely long sequences. Most existing approaches leverage sparsity or
low-rank assumptions in the attention matrix to reduce cost, but sacrifice
expressiveness. Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attention
capability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memory
complexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as a
conditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate the
conditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location can
attend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirect
attention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations of
embeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attention
patterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design of
such factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost
($\mathcal{O}(L\log(L))$ or $\mathcal{O}(L\sqrt{L})$). Combiner is a drop-in
replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily
implemented in common frameworks. An experimental evaluation on both
autoregressive and bidirectional sequence tasks demonstrates the effectiveness
of this approach, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text
modeling tasks.]]></summary>

features should provide sufficient information for the predicted outcome and
should be independent of the membership of individuals in protected groups such

the justification of the text-based neural models. We tie the explanatory power
of the model to fairness in the outcome and propose a fairness-aware
summarization mechanism to detect and counteract the bias in such models. Given
a potentially biased natural language explanation for a decision, we use a
multi-task neural model and an attribution mechanism based on integrated
gradients to extract the high-utility and discrimination-free justifications in
the form of a summary. The extracted summary is then used for training a model
to make decisions for individuals. Results on several real-world datasets
suggests that our method: (i) assists users to understand what information is

text translation performance. In this study, we are interested in training a
speech to text translation model along with an auxiliary text to text
translation task. We conduct a detailed analysis to understand the impact of
the auxiliary task on the primary task within the multitask learning framework.
Our analysis confirms that multitask learning tends to generate similar decoder
representations from different modalities and preserve more information from
the pretrained text translation modules. We observe minimal negative transfer
effect between the two tasks and sharing more parameters is helpful to transfer
knowledge from the text task to the speech task. The analysis also reveals that
the modality representation difference at the top decoder layers is still not
negligible, and those layers are critical for the translation quality. Inspired
by these findings, we propose three methods to improve translation quality.
First, a parameter sharing and initialization strategy is proposed to enhance
information sharing between the tasks. Second, a novel attention-based
regularization is proposed for the encoders and pulls the representations from
different modalities closer. Third, an online knowledge distillation is
proposed to enhance the knowledge transfer from the text to the speech task.
Our experiments show that the proposed approach improves translation
performance by more than 2 BLEU over a strong baseline and achieves
state-of-the-art results on the \textsc{MuST-C} English-German, English-French

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Visually-aware recommendation on E-commerce platforms aims to leverage visual
information of items to predict a user's preference. It is commonly observed
that user's attention to visual features does not always reflect the real
preference. Although a user may click and view an item in light of a visual
satisfaction of their expectations, a real purchase does not always occur due
to the unsatisfaction of other essential features (e.g., brand, material,
price). We refer to the reason for such a visually related interaction
deviating from the real preference as a visual bias. Existing visually-aware
models make use of the visual features as a separate collaborative signal
similarly to other features to directly predict the user's preference without
considering a potential bias, which gives rise to a visually biased
recommendation. In this paper, we derive a causal graph to identify and analyze
the visual bias of these existing methods. In this causal graph, the visual
feature of an item acts as a mediator, which could introduce a spurious
relationship between the user and the item. To eliminate this spurious
relationship that misleads the prediction of the user's real preference, an
intervention and a counterfactual inference are developed over the mediator.
Particularly, the Total Indirect Effect is applied for a debiased prediction
during the testing phase of the model. This causal inference framework is model
agnostic such that it can be integrated into the existing methods. Furthermore,
we propose a debiased visually-aware recommender system, denoted as CausalRec
to effectively retain the supportive significance of the visual information and
remove the visual bias. Extensive experiments are conducted on eight benchmark
datasets, which shows the state-of-the-art performance of CausalRec and the
efficacy of debiasing.]]></summary>

one hand, they facilitate innovation at companies, but on the other, they are
unlikely to be automated soon. Researchers struggle with accurately approaching
quantitatively the study of soft skills due to the lack of data-driven methods
to retrieve them. This limits the possibility for psychologists and HR managers
to understand the relation between humans and digitalisation. This paper
presents SkillNER, a novel data-driven method for automatically extracting soft
skills from text. It is a named entity recognition (NER) system trained with a
support vector machine (SVM) on a corpus of more than 5000 scientific papers.
We developed this system by measuring the performance of our approach against
different training models and validating the results together with a team of
psychologists. Finally, SkillNER was tested in a real-world case study using
the job descriptions of ESCO (European Skill/Competence Qualification and
Occupation) as textual source. The system enabled the detection of communities
of job profiles based on their shared soft skills and communities of soft
skills based on their shared job profiles. This case study demonstrates that
the tool can automatically retrieve soft skills from a large corpus in an
efficient way, proving useful for firms, institutions, and workers. The tool is

queries when they have complex information-seeking needs. Conversational search
systems make it possible to improve user satisfaction by asking questions to

masterpieces and labeled the visual fixations with state-of-art vision models.
Second, we clustered the visual guidance templates of the art masterpieces with
unsupervised learning. Third, we developed a pipeline using generative
adversarial networks to learn the principles of visual guidance and that can
produce aesthetically pleasing layouts. We show that the aesthetic visual
guidance principles can be learned and integrated into a high-dimensional model
and can be queried by the features of graphic elements. We evaluate our
approach by generating layouts on various drawings and graphic designs.
Moreover, our model considers the color and structure of graphic elements when
generating layouts. Consequently, we believe our tool, which generates multiple

domains generalize better on unseen target domains. The performances of current

explore how unsupervised learning can help deep models generalizes across

unsupervised domain generalization, which aims to learn generalizable models
with unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose a Domain-Irrelevant Unsupervised

heterogeneity within unlabeled data and severe distribution shifts between

counterbalance the scarcity of labeled data but also further strengthen the
generalization ability of models when the labeled data are sufficient. As a
pretraining approach, DIUL shows superior to ImageNet pretraining protocol even
when the available data are unlabeled and of a greatly smaller amount compared

have attracted a surge of interest. Due to more compatible and complementary
information from multiple views, existing multi-view methods could achieve more
promising performance than conventional single-view methods in most situations.
However, there are still no sufficient researches on the unified framework in
existing multi-view works. Meanwhile, how to efficiently integrate multi-view
information is still full of challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel
multi-view learning framework, which aims to leverage most existing graph
embedding works into a unified formula via introducing the graph consensus
term. In particular, our method explores the graph structure in each view
independently to preserve the diversity property of graph embedding methods.
Meanwhile, we choose heterogeneous graphs to construct the graph consensus term
to explore the correlations among multiple views jointly. To this end, the
diversity and complementary information among different views could be
simultaneously considered. Furthermore, the proposed framework is utilized to
implement the multi-view extension of Locality Linear Embedding, named
Multi-view Locality Linear Embedding (MvLLE), which could be efficiently solved
by applying the alternating optimization strategy. Empirical validations
conducted on six benchmark datasets can show the effectiveness of our proposed
method.]]></summary>

accuracy and robustness of the probabilistic inferences on represented data.
The new method models the dependency between input feature vectors (images) and
weighs the outliers with a higher penalty by generalizing the original loss
function to the coupled entropy function, using the principles of nonlinear
statistical coupling. We evaluate the performance of the coupled VAE model
using the MNIST dataset. Compared with the traditional VAE algorithm, the
output images generated by the coupled VAE method are clearer and less blurry.
The visualization of the input images embedded in 2D latent variable space
provides a deeper insight into the structure of new model with coupled loss
function: the latent variable has a smaller deviation and a more compact latent
space generates the output values. We analyze the histogram of the likelihoods
of the input images using the generalized mean, which measures the model's
accuracy as a function of the relative risk. The neutral accuracy, which is the
geometric mean and is consistent with a measure of the Shannon cross-entropy,
is improved. The robust accuracy, measured by the -2/3 generalized mean, is
also improved.]]></summary>

to browse and engage with, has gained tremendous popularity among social media
platforms. In this paper, we propose to study the diversity problem in such a
scenario from an item sequence perspective using time series analysis
techniques. We derive a method called sliding spectrum decomposition (SSD) that
captures users' perception of diversity in browsing a long item sequence. We
also share our experiences in designing and implementing a suitable item
embedding method for accurate similarity measurement under long tail effect.
Combined together, they are now fully implemented and deployed in Xiaohongshu

images, but they often suffer from the training instability issues and the
phenomenon of mode loss. In order to attain greater diversity in GAN
synthesized data, it is critical to solving the problem of mode loss. Our work
explores probabilistic approaches to GAN modelling that could allow us to
tackle these issues. We present Prb-GANs, a new variation that uses dropout to
create a distribution over the network parameters with the posterior learnt
using variational inference. We describe theoretically and validate
experimentally using simple and complex datasets the benefits of such an
approach. We look into further improvements using the concept of uncertainty
measures. Through a set of further modifications to the loss functions for each
network of the GAN, we are able to get results that show the improvement of GAN
performance. Our methods are extremely simple and require very little
modification to existing GAN architecture.]]></summary>

dynamic closure, which encompasses the conditions from prior analyses for deep
neural network function approximation. Under Besov dynamic closure, we prove
that the FQI-type algorithm enjoys the sample complexity of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \kappa^{1 + d/\alpha} \cdot \epsilon^{-2 -
2d/\alpha} \right)$ where $\kappa$ is a distribution shift measure, $d$ is the
dimensionality of the state-action space, $\alpha$ is the (possibly fractional)
smoothness parameter of the underlying MDP, and $\epsilon$ is a user-specified
precision. This is an improvement over the sample complexity of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( K \cdot \kappa^{2 + d/\alpha} \cdot \epsilon^{-2 -

Importantly, our sample complexity is obtained under the new general dynamic

from a single RGB image. In contrast to previous works that map from local

estimate egocentric vehicle orientation. This approach features a deep model
that transforms perceived intensities to IGRs, which are mapped to a 3D
representation encoding object orientation in the camera coordinate system.
Core problems are what IGRs to use and how to learn them more effectively. We
answer the former question by designing IGRs based on an interpolated cuboid
that derives from primitive 3D annotation readily. The latter question
motivates us to incorporate geometry knowledge with a new loss function based
on a projective invariant. This loss function allows unlabeled data to be used
in the training stage to improve representation learning. Without additional
labels, our system outperforms previous monocular RGB-based methods for joint
vehicle detection and pose estimation on the KITTI benchmark, achieving
performance even comparable to stereo methods. Code and pre-trained models are

remotely in inaccessible places: the robot could reproduce in the remote
location the movements of an operator equipped with a wearable motion capture
device while sending visual feedback to the operator. While substantial
progress has been made on transferring ("retargeting") human motions to
humanoid robots, a major problem preventing the deployment of such systems in
real applications is the presence of communication delays between the human
input and the feedback from the robot: even a few hundred milliseconds of delay
can irreversibly disturb the operator, let alone a few seconds. To overcome
these delays, we introduce a system in which a humanoid robot executes commands
before it actually receives them, so that the visual feedback appears to be
synchronized to the operator, whereas the robot executed the commands in the
past. To do so, the robot continuously predicts future commands by querying a
machine learning model that is trained on past trajectories and conditioned on
the last received commands. In our experiments, an operator was able to
successfully control a humanoid robot (32 degrees of freedom) with stochastic
delays up to 2 seconds in several whole-body manipulation tasks, including
reaching different targets, picking up, and placing a box at distinct

utilize the recurrent neural network architecture or self-attention to model
the sequential patterns and temporal influence among a user's historical
behavior and learn the user's preference at a specific time. However, these
methods have two main drawbacks. First, they focus on modeling users' dynamic
states from a user-centric perspective and always neglect the dynamics of items
over time. Second, most of them deal with only the first-order user-item
interactions and do not consider the high-order connectivity between users and
items, which has recently been proved helpful for the sequential
recommendation. To address the above problems, in this article, we attempt to
model user-item interactions by a bipartite graph structure and propose a new
recommendation approach based on a Position-enhanced and Time-aware Graph
Convolutional Network (PTGCN) for the sequential recommendation. PTGCN models
the sequential patterns and temporal dynamics between user-item interactions by
defining a position-enhanced and time-aware graph convolution operation and
learning the dynamic representations of users and items simultaneously on the
bipartite graph with a self-attention aggregator. Also, it realizes the
high-order connectivity between users and items by stacking multi-layer graph
convolutions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PTGCN, we carried out a
comprehensive evaluation of PTGCN on three real-world datasets of different
sizes compared with a few competitive baselines. Experimental results indicate
that PTGCN outperforms several state-of-the-art models in terms of two
commonly-used evaluation metrics for ranking.]]></summary>

severity of retinal degenerative diseases such as age-related macular
degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy (DR) in clinical
practice, for which the fovea and optic disc (OD) are important retinal
landmarks. However, the occurrence of lesions, drusen, and other retinal
abnormalities during retinal degeneration severely complicates automatic
landmark detection and segmentation. Here we propose HBA-U-Net: a U-Net
backbone enriched with hierarchical bottleneck attention. The network consists
of a novel bottleneck attention block that combines and refines self-attention,
channel attention, and relative-position attention to highlight retinal
abnormalities that may be important for fovea and OD segmentation in the
degenerated retina. HBA-U-Net achieved state-of-the-art results on fovea
detection across datasets and eye conditions (ADAM: Euclidean Distance (ED) of
25.4 pixels, REFUGE: 32.5 pixels, IDRiD: 32.1 pixels), on OD segmentation for
AMD (ADAM: Dice Coefficient (DC) of 0.947), and on OD detection for DR (IDRiD:

pointwise residuals. We derive rigorous bounds on the error, incurred by PINNs
in approximating the solutions of a large class of linear parabolic PDEs,
namely Kolmogorov equations that include the heat equation and Black-Scholes
equation of option pricing, as examples. We construct neural networks, whose
PINN residual (generalization error) can be made as small as desired. We also
prove that the total $L^2$-error can be bounded by the generalization error,
which in turn is bounded in terms of the training error, provided that a
sufficient number of randomly chosen training (collocation) points is used.
Moreover, we prove that the size of the PINNs and the number of training
samples only grow polynomially with the underlying dimension, enabling PINNs to
overcome the curse of dimensionality in this context. These results enable us
to provide a comprehensive error analysis for PINNs in approximating Kolmogorov

many practical cases. In addition, we usually do not know the class-priors of

life. Characterizing such complex brain development requires effective analysis
of longitudinal and multi-modal neuroimaging data. Here, we propose such an
analysis approach named Longitudinal Correlation Analysis (LCA). LCA couples
the data of two modalities by first reducing the input from each modality to a
latent representation based on autoencoders. A self-supervised strategy then
relates the two latent spaces by jointly disentangling two directions, one in
each space, such that the longitudinal changes in latent representations along
those directions are maximally correlated between modalities. We applied LCA to
analyze the longitudinal T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRIs of 679 youths
from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence.
Unlike existing approaches that focus on either cross-sectional or single-modal
modeling, LCA successfully unraveled coupled macrostructural and
microstructural brain development from morphological and diffusivity features
extracted from the data. A retesting of LCA on raw 3D image volumes of those
subjects successfully replicated the findings from the feature-based analysis.
Lastly, the developmental effects revealed by LCA were inline with the current
understanding of maturational patterns of the adolescent brain.]]></summary>

of BERT to pre-train a 12-layer Transformer model over 4,166 pieces of

effective even if none of the MIDI data of the downstream tasks are seen at the
pre-training stage, and that freezing the self-attention layers of the
Transformer at the fine-tuning stage slightly degrades performance. All the

achieve growing and preserving investment performance. Within the modern
portfolio construction framework that built on Markowitz's theory, the
covariance matrix of stock returns is required to model the portfolio risk.
Traditional approaches to estimate the covariance matrix are based on human
designed risk factors, which often requires tremendous time and effort to
design better risk factors to improve the covariance estimation. In this work,
we formulate the quest of mining risk factors as a learning problem and propose
a deep learning solution to effectively "design" risk factors with neural
networks. The learning objective is carefully set to ensure the learned risk
factors are effective in explaining stock returns as well as have desired
orthogonality and stability. Our experiments on the stock market data
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method: our method can obtain
$1.9\%$ higher explained variance measured by $R^2$ and also reduce the risk of
a global minimum variance portfolio. Incremental analysis further supports our
design of both the architecture and the learning objective.]]></summary>

design goals such as minimizing the worst-case error, satisfying a given

techniques for optimizing such non-decomposable objectives reduce the problem
into a sequence of cost-sensitive learning tasks, each of which is then solved
by re-weighting the training loss with example-specific costs. We point out
that the standard approach of re-weighting the loss to incorporate label costs
can produce unsatisfactory results when used to train over-parameterized
models. As a remedy, we propose new cost-sensitive losses that extend the
classical idea of logit adjustment to handle more general cost matrices. Our

This paper aims to improve disaster relief efficiency via mining and analyzing
social media data like public attitudes towards disaster response and public
demands for targeted relief supplies during different types of disasters. We
focus on different natural disasters based on properties such as types,
durations, and damages, which contains a total of 41,993 tweets. In this paper,
public perception is assessed qualitatively by manually classified tweets,
which contain information like the demand for targeted relief supplies,
satisfactions of disaster response, and public fear. Public attitudes to
natural disasters are studied via a quantitative analysis using eight machine
learning models. To better provide decision-makers with the appropriate model,
the comparison of machine learning models based on computational time and
prediction accuracy is conducted. The change of public opinion during different
natural disasters and the evolution of people's behavior of using social media
for disaster relief in the face of the identical type of natural disasters as
Twitter continues to evolve are studied. The results in this paper demonstrate
the feasibility and validation of the proposed research approach and provide

stratification of patients. Automated segmentation methods can help to assess
risk areas more accurately, and assist in therapeutic procedures or even

variational autoencoder and U-Net with a common EfficientNet-B4 backbone, and
uses a joint loss for latent-space optimization for target samples. We show
that our model can generalize to unseen target NBI (target) modality when
trained using only WLI (source) modality. Our experiments on both upper and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In machine learning, the notion of multi-armed bandits refers to a class of
online learning problems, in which an agent is supposed to simultaneously
explore and exploit a given set of choice alternatives in the course of a
sequential decision process. In the standard setting, the agent learns from
stochastic feedback in the form of real-valued rewards. In many applications,
however, numerical reward signals are not readily available -- instead, only
weaker information is provided, in particular relative preferences in the form
of qualitative comparisons between pairs of alternatives. This observation has
motivated the study of variants of the multi-armed bandit problem, in which
more general representations are used both for the type of feedback to learn
from and the target of prediction. The aim of this paper is to provide a survey
of the state of the art in this field, referred to as preference-based
multi-armed bandits or dueling bandits. To this end, we provide an overview of
problems that have been considered in the literature as well as methods for
tackling them. Our taxonomy is mainly based on the assumptions made by these
methods about the data-generating process and, related to this, the properties
of the preference-based feedback.]]></summary>

transcription-style automatic speech recognition (RT-ASR) systems from
small-scale rich transcription-style and large-scale common transcription-style
datasets. In spontaneous speech tasks, various speech phenomena such as
fillers, word fragments, laughter and coughs, etc. are often included. While
common transcriptions do not give special awareness to these phenomena, rich
transcriptions explicitly convert them into special phenomenon tokens as well
as textual tokens. In previous studies, the textual and phenomenon tokens were
simultaneously estimated in an end-to-end manner. However, it is difficult to
build accurate RT-ASR systems because large-scale rich transcription-style
datasets are often unavailable. To solve this problem, our training method uses
a limited rich transcription-style dataset and common transcription-style
dataset simultaneously. The Key process in our semi-supervised learning is to
convert the common transcription-style dataset into a pseudo-rich
transcription-style dataset. To this end, we introduce style tokens which
control phenomenon tokens are generated or not into transformer-based
autoregressive modeling. We use this modeling for generating the pseudo-rich
transcription-style datasets and for building RT-ASR system from the pseudo and
original datasets. Our experiments on spontaneous ASR tasks showed the
effectiveness of the proposed method.]]></summary>

leverage the power of AI models for clinical decision support. For medical
images, saliency maps are the most common form of explanation. The maps
highlight important features for AI model's prediction. Although many saliency
map methods have been proposed, it is unknown how well they perform on
explaining decisions on multi-modal medical images, where each modality/channel
carries distinct clinical meanings of the same underlying biomedical
phenomenon. Understanding such modality-dependent features is essential for
clinical users' interpretation of AI decisions. To tackle this clinically
important but technically ignored problem, we propose the MSFI
(Modality-Specific Feature Importance) metric to examine whether saliency maps
can highlight modality-specific important features. MSFI encodes the clinical
requirements on modality prioritization and modality-specific feature
localization. Our evaluations on 16 commonly used saliency map methods,
including a clinician user study, show that although most saliency map methods
captured modality importance information in general, most of them failed to
highlight modality-specific important features consistently and precisely. The
evaluation results guide the choices of saliency map methods and provide
insights to propose new ones targeting clinical applications.]]></summary>

signalized traffic operations management. Specifically, we focus on predicting
sensor states in high-resolution (second-by-second). This contrasts with
traditional traffic forecasting problems, which have focused on predicting
aggregated traffic variables, typically over intervals that are no shorter than
5 minutes. Our contributions can be summarized as offering three insights:
first, we show how the prediction problem can be modeled as a matrix completion
problem. Second, we employ a block-coordinate descent algorithm and demonstrate
that the algorithm converges in sub-linear time to a block coordinate-wise
optimizer. This allows us to capitalize on the "bigness" of high-resolution
data in a computationally feasible way. Third, we develop an ensemble learning
(or adaptive boosting) approach to reduce the training error to within any
arbitrary error threshold. The latter utilizes past days so that the boosting
can be interpreted as capturing periodic patterns in the data. The performance
of the proposed method is analyzed theoretically and tested empirically using
both simulated data and a real-world high-resolution traffic dataset from Abu
Dhabi, UAE. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms
other state-of-the-art algorithms.]]></summary>

train a global model without obtaining clients' private data. The main
challenges in FL are statistical diversity among clients, limited computing
capability among client equipments and the excessive communication overhead and
long latency between server and clients. To address these problems,

we propose a novel personalized federated learning via maximizing correlation
pFedMac), and further extend it to sparse and hierarchical models. By
minimizing loss functions including the properties of an approximated L1-norm
and the hierarchical correlation, the performance on statistical diversity data
is improved and the communicational and computational loads required in the
network are reduced. Theoretical proofs show that pFedMac performs better than
the L2-norm distance based personalization methods. Experimentally, we
demonstrate the benefits of this sparse hierarchical personalization
architecture compared with the state-of-the-art personalization methods and
their extensions (e.g. pFedMac achieves 99.75% accuracy on MNIST and 87.27%

Convolutional Neural Networks (G-CNNs). In this framework, a network layer is
seen as a set of PDE-solvers where geometrically meaningful PDE-coefficients
become the layer's trainable weights. Formulating our PDEs on homogeneous
spaces allows these networks to be designed with built-in symmetries such as
rotation in addition to the standard translation equivariance of CNNs.

Having all the desired symmetries included in the design obviates the need to
include them by means of costly techniques such as data augmentation. We will
discuss our PDE-based G-CNNs (PDE-G-CNNs) in a general homogeneous space
setting while also going into the specifics of our primary case of interest:
roto-translation equivariance.

We solve the PDE of interest by a combination of linear group convolutions
and non-linear morphological group convolutions with analytic kernel
approximations that we underpin with formal theorems. Our kernel approximations
allow for fast GPU-implementation of the PDE-solvers, we release our
implementation with this article. Just like for linear convolution a
morphological convolution is specified by a kernel that we train in our
PDE-G-CNNs. In PDE-G-CNNs we do not use non-linearities such as max/min-pooling
and ReLUs as they are already subsumed by morphological convolutions.

We present a set of experiments to demonstrate the strength of the proposed
PDE-G-CNNs in increasing the performance of deep learning based imaging
applications with far fewer parameters than traditional CNNs.]]></summary>

each ST model using knowledge distillation. Those compressed ST models are
finally merged into one MT model so that the frozen layers of the former are
shared across the tasks. We exemplify our approach on eight GLUE tasks,
demonstrating that it is able to achieve both strong performance and

Lipschitz regression functions with and without label noise when trained by
Gradient Descent (GD). To avoid the problem that in the presence of noisy
labels, neural networks trained to nearly zero training error are inconsistent
on this class, we propose an early stopping rule that allows us to show optimal
rates. This provides an alternative to the result of Hu et al. (2021) who
studied the performance of $\ell 2$ -regularized GD for training shallow
networks in nonparametric regression which fully relied on the infinite-width
network (Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)) approximation. Here we present a simpler
analysis which is based on a partitioning argument of the input space (as in
the case of 1-nearest-neighbor rule) coupled with the fact that trained neural
networks are smooth with respect to their inputs when trained by GD. In the
noise-free case the proof does not rely on any kernelization and can be
regarded as a finite-width result. In the case of label noise, by slightly
modifying the proof, the noise is controlled using a technique of Yao, Rosasco,

parameters are generated from a known prior, while in practice, such
information is often lacking, and needs to be estimated through learning. This
problem is exacerbated in decision-making setups with partial information,
where using a misspecified prior may lead to poor exploration and inferior
performance. In this work we prove, in the context of stochastic linear bandits
and Gaussian priors, that as long as the prior estimate is sufficiently close
to the true prior, the performance of an algorithm that uses the misspecified
prior is close to that of the algorithm that uses the true prior. Next, we
address the task of learning the prior through metalearning, where a learner
updates its estimate of the prior across multiple task instances in order to
improve performance on future tasks. The estimated prior is then updated within
each task based on incoming observations, while actions are selected in order
to maximize expected reward. In this work we apply this scheme within a linear
bandit setting, and provide algorithms and regret bounds, demonstrating its
effectiveness, as compared to an algorithm that knows the correct prior. Our
results hold for a broad class of algorithms, including, for example, Thompson
Sampling and Information Directed Sampling.]]></summary>

advertisement, recommendation systems, medical diagnosis, and econometrics.
Accurate modeling of outcome distributions associated with different
interventions -- known as counterfactual distributions -- is crucial for the
success of these applications. In this work, we propose to model counterfactual
distributions using a novel Hilbert space representation called counterfactual
mean embedding (CME). The CME embeds the associated counterfactual distribution
into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) endowed with a positive definite
kernel, which allows us to perform causal inference over the entire landscape
of the counterfactual distribution. Based on this representation, we propose a
distributional treatment effect (DTE) that can quantify the causal effect over
entire outcome distributions. Our approach is nonparametric as the CME can be
estimated under the unconfoundedness assumption from observational data without
requiring any parametric assumption about the underlying distributions. We also
establish a rate of convergence of the proposed estimator which depends on the
smoothness of the conditional mean and the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the
underlying marginal distributions. Furthermore, our framework allows for more
complex outcomes such as images, sequences, and graphs. Our experimental
results on synthetic data and off-policy evaluation tasks demonstrate the
advantages of the proposed estimator.]]></summary>

such as microcalcifications and masses, as well as morphologic features of
masses in sonographic scans, are the main diagnostic targets for tumor
detection. However, improved specificity of these imaging modalities is
required. A leading alternative target is neoangiogenesis. When pathological,
it contributes to the development of numerous types of tumors, and the
formation of metastases. Hence, demonstrating neoangiogenesis by visualization
of the microvasculature may be of great importance. Super resolution ultrasound
localization microscopy enables imaging of the microvasculature at the
capillary level. Yet, challenges such as long reconstruction time, dependency
on prior knowledge of the system Point Spread Function (PSF), and separability
of the Ultrasound Contrast Agents (UCAs), need to be addressed for translation
of super-resolution US into the clinic. In this work we use a deep neural
network architecture that makes effective use of signal structure to address
these challenges. We present in vivo human results of three different breast
lesions acquired with a clinical US scanner. By leveraging our trained network,
the microvasculature structure is recovered in a short time, without prior PSF
knowledge, and without requiring separability of the UCAs. Each of the
recoveries exhibits a different structure that corresponds with the known
histological structure. This study demonstrates the feasibility of in vivo
human super resolution, based on a clinical scanner, to increase US specificity
for different breast lesions and promotes the use of US in the diagnosis of
breast pathologies.]]></summary>

functionality and is receiving increasing attention during the COVID-19
pandemic. Clinical findings show that it is possible for COVID-19 patients to
have significantly low SpO$_2$ before any obvious symptoms. The prevalence of
cameras has motivated researchers to investigate methods for monitoring SpO$_2$
using videos. Most prior schemes involving smartphones are contact-based: They
require a fingertip to cover the phone's camera and the nearby light source to
capture re-emitted light from the illuminated tissue. In this paper, we propose
the first convolutional neural network based noncontact SpO$_2$ estimation
scheme using smartphone cameras. The scheme analyzes the videos of a
participant's hand for physiological sensing, which is convenient and
comfortable, and can protect their privacy and allow for keeping face masks on.
We design our neural network architectures inspired by the optophysiological

visualizing the weights for channel combination. Our proposed models outperform
the state-of-the-art model that is designed for contact-based SpO$_2$

learner can sample arms any number of times in a given interval and obtain a
random reward from each sample, however, increasing the frequency of sampling
incurs an additive penalty/cost. Thus, there is a tradeoff between obtaining
large reward and incurring sampling cost as a function of the sampling
frequency. The goal is to design a learning algorithm that minimizes regret,
that is defined as the difference of the payoff of the oracle policy and that
of the learning algorithm. CTMAB is fundamentally different than the usual
multi-arm bandit problem (MAB), e.g., even the single-arm case is non-trivial
in CTMAB, since the optimal sampling frequency depends on the mean of the arm,
which needs to be estimated. We first establish lower bounds on the regret
achievable with any algorithm and then propose algorithms that achieve the
lower bound up to logarithmic factors. For the single-arm case, we show that
the lower bound on the regret is $\Omega((\log T)^2/\mu)$, where $\mu$ is the
mean of the arm, and $T$ is the time horizon. For the multiple arms case, we
show that the lower bound on the regret is $\Omega((\log T)^2 \mu/\Delta^2)$,
where $\mu$ now represents the mean of the best arm, and $\Delta$ is the
difference of the mean of the best and the second-best arm. We then propose an

maximum likelihood estimation. This approach becomes challenging in generic
situations where the trained energy is nonconvex, due to the need to sample the
Gibbs distribution associated with this energy. Using general Fenchel duality
results, we derive variational principles dual to maximum likelihood EBMs with
shallow overparametrized neural network energies, both in the active (aka
feature-learning) and lazy regimes. In the active regime, this dual formulation
leads to a training algorithm in which one updates concurrently the particles
in the sample space and the neurons in the parameter space of the energy. We
also consider a variant of this algorithm in which the particles are sometimes
restarted at random samples drawn from the data set, and show that performing
these restarts at every iteration step corresponds to score matching training.
Using intermediate parameter setups in our dual algorithm thereby gives a way
to interpolate between maximum likelihood and score matching training. These
results are illustrated in simple numerical experiments.]]></summary>

tasks to tackle the problem of differently distributed train (source) and test
(target) data. We consider the supervised DA task with a limited number of
annotated samples from the target domain. It corresponds to one of the most
relevant clinical setups: building a sufficiently accurate model on the minimum
possible amount of annotated data. Existing methods mostly fine-tune specific
layers of the pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). However, there is
no consensus on which layers are better to fine-tune, e.g. the first layers for
images with low-level domain shift or the deeper layers for images with
high-level domain shift. To this end, we propose SpotTUnet - a CNN architecture
that automatically chooses the layers which should be optimally fine-tuned.
More specifically, on the target domain, our method additionally learns the
policy that indicates whether a specific layer should be fine-tuned or reused
from the pretrained network. We show that our method performs at the same level
as the best of the nonflexible fine-tuning methods even under the extreme
scarcity of annotated data. Secondly, we show that SpotTUnet policy provides a
layer-wise visualization of the domain shift impact on the network, which could
be further used to develop robust domain generalization methods. In order to
extensively evaluate SpotTUnet performance, we use a publicly available dataset
of brain MR images (CC359), characterized by explicit domain shift. We release
a reproducible experimental pipeline.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Real estate appraisal refers to the process of developing an unbiased opinion
for real property's market value, which plays a vital role in decision-making
for various players in the marketplace (e.g., real estate agents, appraisers,
lenders, and buyers). However, it is a nontrivial task for accurate real estate
appraisal because of three major challenges: (1) The complicated influencing
factors for property value; (2) The asynchronously spatiotemporal dependencies
among real estate transactions; (3) The diversified correlations between
residential communities. To this end, we propose a Multi-Task Hierarchical
Graph Representation Learning (MugRep) framework for accurate real estate
appraisal. Specifically, by acquiring and integrating multi-source urban data,
we first construct a rich feature set to comprehensively profile the real
estate from multiple perspectives (e.g., geographical distribution, human
mobility distribution, and resident demographics distribution). Then, an
evolving real estate transaction graph and a corresponding event graph
convolution module are proposed to incorporate asynchronously spatiotemporal
dependencies among real estate transactions. Moreover, to further incorporate
valuable knowledge from the view of residential communities, we devise a
hierarchical heterogeneous community graph convolution module to capture
diversified correlations between residential communities. Finally, an urban
district partitioned multi-task learning module is introduced to generate
differently distributed value opinions for real estate. Extensive experiments
on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MugRep and its
components and features.]]></summary>

and the top-down method. Therefore, not only can there be better performance,
but also the execution speed can be maintained. The network mainly pays
attention to the quality of the mask. In the previous work, we can see that the
uneven contour of the object is more likely to appear, resulting in low-quality
prediction. Accordingly, we propose enhancement features and corresponding loss
functions for the silhouette of objects and backgrounds to improve the mask.
Meanwhile, we use the new proposed confidence score to solve the occlusion

results. To verify our research, we used the COCO dataset and CityScapes

advancing data processing and machine learning (ML). Improving predictive power
was the focus of previous representation techniques, which unfortunately
perform rather poorly on the interpretability in terms of extracting underlying
insights of the data. Recently, Kolmogorov model (KM) was studied, which is an
interpretable and predictable representation approach to learning the
underlying probabilistic structure of a set of random variables. The existing
KM learning algorithms using semi-definite relaxation with randomization
(SDRwR) or discrete monotonic optimization (DMO) have, however, limited utility
to big data applications because they do not scale well computationally. In
this paper, we propose a computationally scalable KM learning algorithm, based
on the regularized dual optimization combined with enhanced gradient descent
(GD) method. To make our method more scalable to large-dimensional problems, we
propose two acceleration schemes, namely, eigenvalue decomposition (EVD)
elimination strategy and proximal EVD algorithm. Furthermore, a thresholding
technique by exploiting the approximation error analysis and leveraging the
normalized Minkowski $\ell_1$-norm and its bounds, is provided for the
selection of the number of iterations of the proximal EVD algorithm. When
applied to big data applications, it is demonstrated that the proposed method
can achieve compatible training/prediction performance with significantly
reduced computational complexity; roughly two orders of magnitude improvement
in terms of the time overhead, compared to the existing KM learning algorithms.
Furthermore, it is shown that the accuracy of logical relation mining for
interpretability by using the proposed KM learning algorithm exceeds $80\%$.]]></summary>

This provides us with a principled way to organize information about model

NLP areas as they learn powerful textual representation, their models do not

includes the graph relationship between the lectures, concepts, and courses
along with the domain knowledge about the complexity of a concept. We develop
MOOCRep, a novel method based on Transformer language model trained with two
pre-training objectives : 1) graph-based objective to capture the powerful
signal of entities and relations that exist in the graph, and 2)
domain-oriented objective to effectively incorporate the complexity level of

way to solve the data sparsity issue of traditional recommender systems. The
assumption behind is that the knowledge in social user-user connections can be
shared and transferred to the domain of user-item interactions, whereby to help
learn user preferences. However, most existing approaches merely adopt the
first-order connections among users during transfer learning, ignoring those
connections in higher orders. We argue that better recommendation performance
can also benefit from high-order social relations. In this paper, we propose a
novel Propagation-aware Transfer Learning Network (PTLN) based on the
propagation of social relations. We aim to better mine the sharing knowledge
hidden in social networks and thus further improve recommendation performance.
Specifically, we explore social influence in two aspects: (a) higher-order
friends have been taken into consideration by order bias; (b) different friends
in the same order will have distinct importance for recommendation by an
attention mechanism. Besides, we design a novel regularization to bridge the
gap between social relations and user-item interactions. We conduct extensive
experiments on two real-world datasets and beat other counterparts in terms of
ranking accuracy, especially for the cold-start users with few historical

real-world music recordings from diverse musical genres that are not presented
in the labelled training data. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised
framework, ReconVAT, which solves this issue by leveraging the huge amount of
available unlabelled music recordings. The proposed ReconVAT uses
reconstruction loss and virtual adversarial training. When combined with
existing U-net models for AMT, ReconVAT achieves competitive results on common
benchmark datasets such as MAPS and MusicNet. For example, in the few-shot
setting for the string part version of MusicNet, ReconVAT achieves F1-scores of
61.0% and 41.6% for the note-wise and note-with-offset-wise metrics
respectively, which translates into an improvement of 22.2% and 62.5% compared
to the supervised baseline model. Our proposed framework also demonstrates the
potential of continual learning on new data, which could be useful in
real-world applications whereby new data is constantly available.]]></summary>

multi-channel image-based RF signals representation. We also introduce an
iterative training approach which leverages synthesized and augmented RF data
to efficiently build large labelled datasets of RF emissions (SPREAD). WRIST
detector achieves 90 mean Average Precision even in extremely congested
environment in the wild. WRIST model classifies five technologies (Bluetooth,
Lightbridge, Wi-Fi, XPD, and ZigBee) and is easily extendable to others. We are

challenge for least squares based fitting procedures. A large and productive
literature exists, discussing various regularized approaches to improving the

cluster-based regularization - the hierarchical feature regression (HFR) -,
which mobilizes insights from the domains of machine learning and graph theory
to estimate parameters along a supervised hierarchical representation of the
predictor set, shrinking parameters towards group targets. The method is
innovative in its ability to estimate optimal compositions of predictor groups,
as well as the group targets endogenously. The HFR can be viewed as a
supervised factor regression, with the strength of shrinkage governed by a
penalty on the extent of idiosyncratic variation captured in the fitting
process. The method demonstrates good predictive accuracy and versatility,
outperforming a panel of benchmark regularized estimators across a diverse set
of simulated regression tasks, including dense, sparse and grouped data
generating processes. An application to the prediction of economic growth is
used to illustrate the HFR's effectiveness in an empirical setting, with

data, whose collection can be difficult in many cases. Recently, crowdsourcing
has established itself as an efficient labeling solution through resorting to
non-expert crowds. To reduce the labeling error effects, one common practice is
to distribute each instance to multiple workers, whereas each worker only
annotates a subset of data, resulting in the {\it sparse annotation}
phenomenon. In this paper, we note that when meeting with class-imbalance,
i.e., when the ground truth labels are {\it class-imbalanced}, the sparse
annotations are prone to be skewly distributed, which thus can severely bias
the learning algorithm. To combat this issue, we propose one self-training
based approach named {\it Self-Crowd} by progressively adding confident
pseudo-annotations and rebalancing the annotation distribution. Specifically,
we propose one distribution aware confidence measure to select confident
pseudo-annotations, which adopts the resampling strategy to oversample the
minority annotations and undersample the majority annotations. On one
real-world crowdsourcing image classification task, we show that the proposed
method yields more balanced annotations throughout training than the
distribution agnostic methods and substantially improves the learning
performance at different annotation sparsity levels.]]></summary>

and found it capable of generating realistic musical instrument performances
with only 260k total model parameters, conditioned on F0 and loudness features.
We compared our method to state-of-the-art benchmarks with a multi-stimulus

competitively across the tested timbral domains. Our method significantly
outperformed the benchmarks in terms of generation speed, and achieved

with more than 2-3 dimensions with a naked eye. This chapter explores the
efficiency of discovering predictive machine learning models interactively
using new Elliptic Paired coordinates (EPC) visualizations. It is shown that
EPC are capable to visualize multidimensional data and support visual machine
learning with preservation of multidimensional information in 2-D. Relative to
parallel and radial coordinates, EPC visualization requires only a half of the
visual elements for each n-D point. An interactive software system EllipseVis,
which is developed in this work, processes high-dimensional datasets, creates
EPC visualizations, and produces predictive classification models by
discovering dominance rules in EPC. By using interactive and automatic
processes it discovers zones in EPC with a high dominance of a single class.
The EPC methodology has been successful in discovering non-linear predictive
models with high coverage and precision in the computational experiments. This
can benefit multiple domains by producing visually appealing dominance rules.
This chapter presents results of successful testing the EPC non-linear
methodology in experiments using real and simulated data, EPC generalized to
the Dynamic Elliptic Paired Coordinates (DEPC), incorporation of the weights of
coordinates to optimize the visual discovery, introduction of an alternative

applications has attracted lots of attention. Yet the majority of CNNs are
unable to satisfy the strict requirement for real-world deployment. To overcome
this, the recent popular network pruning is an effective method to reduce the
redundancy of the models. However, the ranking of filters according to their
"importance" on different pruning criteria may be inconsistent. One filter
could be important according to a certain criterion, while it is unnecessary
according to another one, which indicates that each criterion is only a partial
view of the comprehensive "importance". From this motivation, we propose a
novel framework to integrate the existing filter pruning criteria by exploring
the criteria diversity. The proposed framework contains two stages: Criteria
Clustering and Filters Importance Calibration. First, we condense the pruning
criteria via layerwise clustering based on the rank of "importance" score.
Second, within each cluster, we propose a calibration factor to adjust their
significance for each selected blending candidates and search for the optimal
blending criterion via Evolutionary Algorithm. Quantitative results on the
CIFAR-100 and ImageNet benchmarks show that our framework outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines, regrading to the compact model performance after
pruning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-epoch, small-batch, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has been the
method of choice for learning with large over-parameterized models. A popular
theory for explaining why SGD works well in practice is that the algorithm has
an implicit regularization that biases its output towards a good solution.
Perhaps the theoretically most well understood learning setting for SGD is that
of Stochastic Convex Optimization (SCO), where it is well known that SGD learns
at a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the number of samples. In this
paper, we consider the problem of SCO and explore the role of implicit
regularization, batch size and multiple epochs for SGD. Our main contributions
are threefold:

(a) We show that for any regularizer, there is an SCO problem for which
Regularized Empirical Risk Minimzation fails to learn. This automatically rules
out any implicit regularization based explanation for the success of SGD.

(b) We provide a separation between SGD and learning via Gradient Descent on
empirical loss (GD) in terms of sample complexity. We show that there is an SCO
problem such that GD with any step size and number of iterations can only learn
at a suboptimal rate: at least $\widetilde{\Omega}(1/n^{5/12})$.

(c) We present a multi-epoch variant of SGD commonly used in practice. We
prove that this algorithm is at least as good as single pass SGD in the worst
case. However, for certain SCO problems, taking multiple passes over the
dataset can significantly outperform single pass SGD.

We extend our results to the general learning setting by showing a problem
which is learnable for any data distribution, and for this problem, SGD is
strictly better than RERM for any regularization function. We conclude by
discussing the implications of our results for deep learning, and show a
separation between SGD and ERM for two layer diagonal neural networks.]]></summary>

they do better at capturing semantic correlations between code snippets and
search queries and have promising performance. However, code snippets have
diverse information from different dimensions, such as business logic, specific
algorithm, and hardware communication, so it is hard for a single code
representation module to cover all the perspectives. On the other hand, as a
specific query may focus on one or several perspectives, it is difficult for a
single query representation module to represent different user intents. In this
paper, we propose MuCoS, a multi-model ensemble learning architecture for
semantic code search. It combines several individual learners, each of which
emphasizes a specific perspective of code snippets. We train the individual
learners on different datasets which contain different perspectives of code
information, and we use a data augmentation strategy to get these different
datasets. Then we ensemble the learners to capture comprehensive features of
code snippets.]]></summary>

speech signal. Our approach uses a Bayesian framework to define a latent
attention map that links frames of the input and target utterances. We train a
masked convolutional encoder-decoder network to produce this attention map via
a stochastic version of the mean absolute error loss function; our model also
predicts the length of the target speech signal using the encoder embeddings.
The predicted length determines the number of steps for the decoder operation.
During inference, we generate the attention map as a proxy for the similarity
matrix between the given input speech and an unknown target speech signal.
Using this similarity matrix, we compute a warping path of alignment between
the two signals. Our experiments demonstrate that this adaptive framework
produces similar results to dynamic time warping, which relies on a known
target signal, on both voice conversion and emotion conversion tasks. We also
show that our technique results in a high quality of generated speech that is
on par with state-of-the-art vocoders.]]></summary>

to reduce the variance of the gradient estimators in practice. A control
variate is applied by subtracting a baseline function from the state-action
value estimates. Then the variance-reduced policy gradient presumably leads to
higher learning efficiency. Recent research on control variates with deep
neural net policies mainly focuses on scalar-valued baseline functions. The
effect of vector-valued baselines is under-explored. This paper investigates
variance reduction with coordinate-wise and layer-wise control variates
constructed from vector-valued baselines for neural net policies. We present
experimental evidence suggesting that lower variance can be obtained with such
baselines than with the conventional scalar-valued baseline. We demonstrate how
to equip the popular Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm with these
new control variates. We show that the resulting algorithm with proper
regularization can achieve higher sample efficiency than scalar control
variates in continuous control benchmarks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Causal discovery from observational data is an important tool in many
branches of science. Under certain assumptions it allows scientists to explain
phenomena, predict, and make decisions. In the large sample limit, sound and
complete causal discovery algorithms have been previously introduced, where a
directed acyclic graph (DAG), or its equivalence class, representing causal
relations is searched. However, in real-world cases, only finite training data
is available, which limits the power of statistical tests used by these
algorithms, leading to errors in the inferred causal model. This is commonly
addressed by devising a strategy for using as few as possible statistical
tests. In this paper, we introduce such a strategy in the form of a recursive
wrapper for existing constraint-based causal discovery algorithms, which
preserves soundness and completeness. It recursively clusters the observed
variables using the normalized min-cut criterion from the outset, and uses a
baseline causal discovery algorithm during backtracking for learning local
sub-graphs. It then combines them and ensures completeness. By an ablation
study, using synthetic data, and by common real-world benchmarks, we
demonstrate that our approach requires significantly fewer statistical tests,
learns more accurate graphs, and requires shorter run-times than the baseline
algorithm.]]></summary>

performance in unseen, out-of-distribution environments. In this paper, we
empirically show that out-of-distribution performance is strongly correlated

in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance on variants of CIFAR-10 &

iWildCam-WILDS. The strong correlations hold across model architectures,
hyperparameters, training set size, and training duration, and are more precise
than what is expected from existing domain adaptation theory. To complete the
picture, we also investigate cases where the correlation is weaker, for
instance some synthetic distribution shifts from CIFAR-10-C and the tissue

based on a Gaussian data model that shows how changes in the data covariance

ordered solution spaces to compute concepts, which are used as binary
classification models for individuals. However, the refinement trees spanned by
these approaches can easily grow to millions of nodes for complex learning
problems. This leads to refinement-based approaches often failing to detect
optimal concepts efficiently. In this paper, we propose a supervised machine
learning approach for learning concept lengths, which allows predicting the

evaluation results suggest that recurrent neural network architectures perform
best at concept length prediction with an F-measure of up to 92%. We show that
integrating our concept length predictor into the CELOE (Class Expression

evidence that it builds a small but effective set of high order transformations
achieving a 95% kill ratio. Five raters manually labeled a pool of images
before and after high order transformation; Fleiss' Kappa and statistical tests
confirmed that they are metamorphic properties. HOMRS built-in relations are
also effective to confront adversarial or out-of-distribution examples; HOMRS

from graph-structured data. Most of the existing graph convolutional networks
share two big shortcomings. First, they are essentially low-pass filters, thus
the potentially useful middle and high frequency band of graph signals are
ignored. Second, the bandwidth of existing graph convolutional filters is
fixed. Parameters of a graph convolutional filter only transform the graph
inputs without changing the curvature of a graph convolutional filter function.
In reality, we are uncertain about whether we should retain or cut off the
frequency at a certain point unless we have expert domain knowledge. In this
paper, we propose Automatic Graph Convolutional Networks (AutoGCN) to capture
the full spectrum of graph signals and automatically update the bandwidth of
graph convolutional filters. While it is based on graph spectral theory, our
AutoGCN is also localized in space and has a spatial form. Experimental results
show that AutoGCN achieves significant improvement over baseline methods which

ignoring the complex dependence among agents. In this paper, we propose to use
copula, a powerful statistical tool for capturing dependence among random

systems. Our proposed model is able to separately learn marginals that capture
the local behavioral patterns of each individual agent, as well as a copula
function that solely and fully captures the dependence structure among agents.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our model

exploring high-dimensional environments to learn complex, long-horizon tasks,
but can often exhibit unsafe behaviors and require extensive environment
interaction when exploration is unconstrained. A promising strategy for safe
learning in dynamically uncertain environments is requiring that the agent can
robustly return to states where task success (and therefore safety) can be
guaranteed. While this approach has been successful in low-dimensions,
enforcing this constraint in environments with high-dimensional state spaces,
such as images, is challenging. We present Latent Space Safe Sets (LS3), which
extends this strategy to iterative, long-horizon tasks with image observations
by using suboptimal demonstrations and a learned dynamics model to restrict
exploration to the neighborhood of a learned Safe Set where task completion is
likely. We evaluate LS3 on 4 domains, including a challenging sequential
pushing task in simulation and a physical cable routing task. We find that LS3
can use prior task successes to restrict exploration and learn more efficiently
than prior algorithms while satisfying constraints. See

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A common problem with most zero and few-shot learning approaches is they
suffer from bias towards seen classes resulting in sub-optimal performance.
Existing efforts aim to utilize unlabeled images from unseen classes (i.e
transductive zero-shot) during training to enable generalization. However, this
limits their use in practical scenarios where data from target unseen classes
is unavailable or infeasible to collect. In this work, we present a practical
setting of inductive zero and few-shot learning, where unlabeled images from
other out-of-data classes, that do not belong to seen or unseen categories, can
be used to improve generalization in any-shot learning. We leverage a
formulation based on product-of-experts and introduce a new AUD module that
enables us to use unlabeled samples from out-of-data classes which are usually
easily available and practically entail no annotation cost. In addition, we
also demonstrate the applicability of our model to address a more practical and
challenging, Generalized Zero-shot under a limited supervision setting, where
even base seen classes do not have sufficient annotated samples.]]></summary>

have turned to algorithmic decision-making to achieve greater fairness in
society. As these efforts intensify, reasoning within the burgeoning field of
"algorithmic fairness" increasingly shapes how fairness manifests in practice.
This paper interrogates whether algorithmic fairness provides the appropriate
conceptual and practical tools for enhancing social equality. I argue that the
dominant, "formal" approach to algorithmic fairness is ill-equipped as a
framework for pursuing equality, as its narrow frame of analysis generates
restrictive approaches to reform. In light of these shortcomings, I propose an
alternative: a "substantive" approach to algorithmic fairness that centers
opposition to social hierarchies and provides a more expansive analysis of how
to address inequality. This substantive approach enables more fruitful
theorizing about the role of algorithms in combatting oppression. The
distinction between formal and substantive algorithmic fairness is exemplified
by each approach's responses to the "impossibility of fairness" (an
incompatibility between mathematical definitions of algorithmic fairness).
While the formal approach requires us to accept the "impossibility of fairness"
as a harsh limit on efforts to enhance equality, the substantive approach
allows us to escape the "impossibility of fairness" by suggesting reforms that
are not subject to this false dilemma and that are better equipped to
ameliorate conditions of social oppression.]]></summary>

Every classification head in the unified model interacts with its peers through

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Common neural network architectures are susceptible to attack by adversarial
samples. Neural network architectures are commonly thought of as divided into
low-level feature extraction layers and high-level classification layers;
susceptibility of networks to adversarial samples is often thought of as a
problem related to classification rather than feature extraction. We test this
idea by selectively retraining different portions of VGG and ResNet
architectures on CIFAR-10, Imagenette and ImageNet using non-adversarial and
adversarial data. Our experimental results show that susceptibility to
adversarial samples is associated with low-level feature extraction layers.
Therefore, retraining high-level layers is insufficient for achieving
robustness. This phenomenon could have two explanations: either, adversarial
attacks yield outputs from early layers that are indistinguishable from
features found in the attack classes, or adversarial attacks yield outputs from
early layers that differ statistically from features for non-adversarial
samples and do not permit consistent classification by subsequent layers. We
test this question by large-scale non-linear dimensionality reduction and
density modeling on distributions of feature vectors in hidden layers and find
that the feature distributions between non-adversarial and adversarial samples
differ substantially. Our results provide new insights into the statistical
origins of adversarial samples and possible defenses.]]></summary>

using distributed data with no need for individual nodes to share data.
Unfortunately, it has also been shown that adversaries may be able to extract
local data contents off model parameters transmitted during federated learning.
A recent solution based on the secure aggregation primitive enabled
privacy-preserving federated learning, but at the expense of significant extra
communication/computational resources. In this paper, we propose a
low-complexity scheme that provides data privacy using substantially reduced
communication/computational resources relative to the existing secure solution.
The key idea behind the suggested scheme is to design the topology of
secret-sharing nodes as a sparse random graph instead of the complete graph
corresponding to the existing solution. We first obtain the necessary and
sufficient condition on the graph to guarantee both reliability and privacy. We
then suggest using the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph in particular and provide
theoretical guarantees on the reliability/privacy of the proposed scheme.
Through extensive real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our scheme, using
only $20 \sim 30\%$ of the resources required in the conventional scheme,
maintains virtually the same levels of reliability and data privacy in
practical federated learning systems.]]></summary>

considerable hyperparameter tuning to determine the optimal amount of

determine this amount of information automatically, on the VAE performance.
While many methods for learning calibrated decoders have been proposed, many of

of calibrated decoder and provide recommendations for simple and effective VAE
training. Our analysis covers a range of image and video datasets and several
single-image and sequential VAE models. We further propose a simple but novel

applications such as film production and augmented reality. However, the furry
characteristics and various appearance of the foregrounds, e.g., animal and
portrait, challenge existing matting methods, which usually require extra user
inputs such as trimap or scribbles. To resolve these problems, we study the
distinct roles of semantics and details for image matting and decompose the
task into two parallel sub-tasks: high-level semantic segmentation and
low-level details matting. Specifically, we propose a novel Glance and Focus
Matting network (GFM), which employs a shared encoder and two separate decoders
to learn both tasks in a collaborative manner for end-to-end natural image
matting. Besides, due to the limitation of available natural images in the
matting task, previous methods typically adopt composite images for training
and evaluation, which result in limited generalization ability on real-world
images. In this paper, we investigate the domain gap issue between composite
images and real-world images systematically by conducting comprehensive
analyses of various discrepancies between foreground and background images. We
find that a carefully designed composition route RSSN that aims to reduce the
discrepancies can lead to a better model with remarkable generalization
ability. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark containing 2,000 high-resolution
real-world animal images and 10,000 portrait images along with their manually
labeled alpha mattes to serve as a test bed for evaluating matting model's
generalization ability on real-world images. Comprehensive empirical studies
have demonstrated that GFM outperforms state-of-the-art methods and effectively
reduces the generalization error. The code and the dataset will be released.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning the joint probability of random variables (RVs) is the cornerstone
of statistical signal processing and machine learning. However, direct
nonparametric estimation for high-dimensional joint probability is in general
impossible, due to the curse of dimensionality. Recent work has proposed to
recover the joint probability mass function (PMF) of an arbitrary number of RVs
from three-dimensional marginals, leveraging the algebraic properties of
low-rank tensor decomposition and the (unknown) dependence among the RVs.
Nonetheless, accurately estimating three-dimensional marginals can still be
costly in terms of sample complexity, affecting the performance of this line of
work in practice in the sample-starved regime. Using three-dimensional
marginals also involves challenging tensor decomposition problems whose
tractability is unclear. This work puts forth a new framework for learning the
joint PMF using only pairwise marginals, which naturally enjoys a lower sample
complexity relative to the third-order ones. A coupled nonnegative matrix
factorization (CNMF) framework is developed, and its joint PMF recovery
guarantees under various conditions are analyzed. Our method also features a
Gram--Schmidt (GS)-like algorithm that exhibits competitive runtime
performance. The algorithm is shown to provably recover the joint PMF up to
bounded error in finite iterations, under reasonable conditions. It is also
shown that a recently proposed economical expectation maximization (EM)
algorithm guarantees to improve upon the GS-like algorithm's output, thereby
further lifting up the accuracy and efficiency. Real-data experiments are
employed to showcase the effectiveness.]]></summary>

fetal size according to standardized charts. To achieve a reproducible and
accurate measurement, a sonographer needs to identify three standard 2D planes
of the fetal anatomy (head, abdomen, femur) and manually mark the key
anatomical landmarks on the image for accurate biometry and fetal weight
estimation. This can be a time-consuming operator-dependent task, especially
for a trainee sonographer. Computer-assisted techniques can help in automating
the fetal biometry computation process. In this paper, we present a unified
automated framework for estimating all measurements needed for the fetal weight
assessment. The proposed framework semantically segments the key fetal
anatomies using state-of-the-art segmentation models, followed by region
fitting and scale recovery for the biometry estimation. We present an ablation
study of segmentation algorithms to show their robustness through 4-fold
cross-validation on a dataset of 349 ultrasound standard plane images from 42

Time Projection Chamber tracker of the MPD experiment at the NICA accelerator
complex. Our method is based on a Generative Adversarial Network - a deep
learning technique allowing for implicit estimation of the population
distribution for a given set of objects. This approach lets us learn and then
sample from the distribution of raw detector responses, conditioned on the
parameters of the charged particle tracks. To evaluate the quality of the
proposed model, we integrate a prototype into the MPD software stack and
demonstrate that it produces high-quality events similar to the detailed
simulator, with a speed-up of at least an order of magnitude. The prototype is
trained on the responses from the inner part of the detector and, once expanded
to the full detector, should be ready for use in physics tasks.]]></summary>

methods in large-scale problems. Related works have been recognized by the
NeurIPS Test-of-Time award in 2017 and the ICML Best Paper Finalist in 2019.
The body of work on random features has grown rapidly, and hence it is
desirable to have a comprehensive overview on this topic explaining the
connections among various algorithms and theoretical results. In this survey,
we systematically review the work on random features from the past ten years.
First, the motivations, characteristics and contributions of representative
random features based algorithms are summarized according to their sampling
schemes, learning procedures, variance reduction properties and how they
exploit training data. Second, we review theoretical results that center around
the following key question: how many random features are needed to ensure a
high approximation quality or no loss in the empirical/expected risks of the
learned estimator. Third, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of popular
random features based algorithms on several large-scale benchmark datasets and
discuss their approximation quality and prediction performance for
classification. Last, we discuss the relationship between random features and
modern over-parameterized deep neural networks (DNNs), including the use of
high dimensional random features in the analysis of DNNs as well as the gaps
between current theoretical and empirical results. This survey may serve as a
gentle introduction to this topic, and as a users' guide for practitioners
interested in applying the representative algorithms and understanding
theoretical results under various technical assumptions. We hope that this
survey will facilitate discussion on the open problems in this topic, and more
importantly, shed light on future research directions.]]></summary>

word in a given textual context. Contextual word embedding models have achieved
state-of-the-art results in the lexical substitution task by relying on
contextual information extracted from the replaced word within the sentence.
However, such models do not take into account structured knowledge that exists
in external lexical databases.

We introduce LexSubCon, an end-to-end lexical substitution framework based on
contextual embedding models that can identify highly accurate substitute
candidates. This is achieved by combining contextual information with knowledge
from structured lexical resources. Our approach involves: (i) introducing a
novel mix-up embedding strategy in the creation of the input embedding of the
target word through linearly interpolating the pair of the target input
embedding and the average embedding of its probable synonyms; (ii) considering
the similarity of the sentence-definition embeddings of the target word and its
proposed candidates; and, (iii) calculating the effect of each substitution in
the semantics of the sentence through a fine-tuned sentence similarity model.
Our experiments show that LexSubCon outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods on LS07 and CoInCo benchmark datasets that are widely used for lexical
substitution tasks.]]></summary>

the operator with exact data to acquire excellent yield to farmers. In this
work, a study is proposed that incorporates all common state-of-the-art

Things (IoT) for data collection, machine Learning for crop damage prediction,
and deep learning for crop disease detection is used. The data collection using
IoT is responsible for the measure of moisture levels for smart irrigation, n,
p, k estimations of fertilizers for best yield development. For crop damage
prediction, various algorithms like Random Forest (RF), Light gradient boosting
machine (LGBM), XGBoost (XGB), Decision Tree (DT) and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
are used. Subsequently, Pre-Trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models

over the years, many of them still fail at preserving the fine details of the
image after denoising. This is as a result of the smooth-out effect they have
on the images. Most neural network-based algorithms have achieved better
quantitative performance than the classical denoising algorithms. However, they
also suffer from qualitative (visual) performance as a result of the smooth-out

propose a deep collaborative filtering-based (Deep-CoFiB) algorithm for image
denoising. This algorithm performs collaborative denoising of image patches in
the sparse domain using a set of optimized neural network models. This results
in a fast algorithm that is able to excellently obtain a trade-off between
noise removal and details preservation. Extensive experiments show that the
DeepCoFiB performed quantitatively (in terms of PSNR and SSIM) and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Machine learning algorithms often produce models considered as complex
black-box models by both end users and developers. They fail to explain the
model in terms of the domain they are designed for. The proposed Iterative
Visual Logical Classifier (IVLC) is an interpretable machine learning algorithm
that allows end users to design a model and classify data with more confidence
and without having to compromise on the accuracy. Such technique is especially
helpful when dealing with sensitive and crucial data like cancer data in the
medical domain with high cost of errors. With the help of the proposed
interactive and lossless multidimensional visualization, end users can identify
the pattern in the data based on which they can make explainable decisions.
Such options would not be possible in black box machine learning methodologies.
The interpretable IVLC algorithm is supported by the Interactive Shifted Paired
Coordinates Software System (SPCVis). It is a lossless multidimensional data
visualization system with user interactive features. The interactive approach
provides flexibility to the end user to perform data classification as
self-service without having to rely on a machine learning expert. Interactive
pattern discovery becomes challenging while dealing with large data sets with
hundreds of dimensions/features. To overcome this problem, this chapter
proposes an automated classification approach combined with new Coordinate
Order Optimizer (COO) algorithm and a Genetic algorithm. The COO algorithm
automatically generates the coordinate pair sequences that best represent the
data separation and the genetic algorithm helps optimizing the proposed IVLC
algorithm by automatically generating the areas for data classification. The
feasibility of the approach is shown by experiments on benchmark datasets
covering both interactive and automated processes used for data classification.]]></summary>

such as extreme weather early warning and long-term energy consumption
planning. This paper studies the \textit{long-term forecasting} problem of time
series. Prior Transformer-based models adopt various self-attention mechanisms
to discover the long-range dependencies. However, intricate temporal patterns
of the long-term future prohibit the model from finding reliable dependencies.
Also, Transformers have to adopt the sparse versions of point-wise
self-attentions for long series efficiency, resulting in the information
utilization bottleneck. Towards these challenges, we propose Autoformer as a
novel decomposition architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. We go
beyond the pre-processing convention of series decomposition and renovate it as
a basic inner block of deep models. This design empowers Autoformer with
progressive decomposition capacities for complex time series. Further, inspired
by the stochastic process theory, we design the Auto-Correlation mechanism
based on the series periodicity, which conducts the dependencies discovery and
representation aggregation at the sub-series level. Auto-Correlation
outperforms self-attention in both efficiency and accuracy. In long-term
forecasting, Autoformer yields state-of-the-art accuracy, with a 38% relative
improvement on six benchmarks, covering five practical applications: energy,

the classes they have been trained for. Runtime monitoring techniques on the
neuron activation pattern can be used to detect such inputs. We present an
approach for monitoring classification systems via data abstraction. Data
abstraction relies on the notion of box with a resolution. Box-based
abstraction consists in representing a set of values by its minimal and maximal
values in each dimension. We augment boxes with a notion of resolution and
define their clustering coverage, which is intuitively a quantitative metric
that indicates the abstraction quality. This allows studying the effect of
different clustering parameters on the constructed boxes and estimating an
interval of sub-optimal parameters. Moreover, we automatically construct
monitors that leverage both the correct and incorrect behaviors of a system.
This allows checking the size of the monitor abstractions and analyzing the
separability of the network. Monitors are obtained by combining the
sub-monitors of each class of the system placed at some selected layers. Our
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our clustering coverage estimation
and show how to assess the effectiveness and precision of monitors according to
the selected clustering parameter and monitored layers.]]></summary>

of marine and terrestrial ecosystems. However, due to the complex environment,
severe vegetation mixture, and difficulty of access, it is impossible to
accurately classify coastal wetlands and identify their species with
traditional classifiers. Despite the integration of multisource remote sensing
data for performance enhancement, there are still challenges with acquiring and
exploiting the complementary merits from multisource data. In this paper, the
Deepwise Feature Interaction Network (DFINet) is proposed for wetland
classification. A depthwise cross attention module is designed to extract
self-correlation and cross-correlation from multisource feature pairs. In this
way, meaningful complementary information is emphasized for classification.
DFINet is optimized by coordinating consistency loss, discrimination loss, and
classification loss. Accordingly, DFINet reaches the standard solution-space
under the regularity of loss functions, while the spatial consistency and
feature discrimination are preserved. Comprehensive experimental results on two
hyperspectral and multispectral wetland datasets demonstrate that the proposed
DFINet outperforms other competitive methods in terms of overall accuracy.]]></summary>

autoregressive distribution estimation where the features can occur in an
arbitrary order, is a challenging problem in generative machine learning. Prior
work on OADE has encoded feature identity by assigning each feature to a
distinct fixed position in an input vector. As a result, architectures built
for these inputs must strategically mask either the input or model weights to
learn the various conditional distributions necessary for inferring the full
joint distribution of the dataset in an order-agnostic way. In this paper, we
propose an alternative approach for encoding feature identities, where each
feature's identity is included alongside its value in the input. This feature
identity encoding strategy allows neural architectures designed for sequential
data to be applied to the OADE task without modification. As a proof of
concept, we show that a Transformer trained on this input (which we refer to as
"the DEformer", i.e., the distribution estimating Transformer) can effectively
model binarized-MNIST, approaching the performance of fixed-order
autoregressive distribution estimating algorithms while still being entirely
order-agnostic. Additionally, we find that the DEformer surpasses the
performance of recent flow-based architectures when modeling a tabular dataset.]]></summary>

field of studying privacy-preserving machine learning from isolated data
sources, i.e., federated learning. A class of federated learning, vertical

users, has a great potential of driving a more variety of business cooperation
among enterprises in many fields. In machine learning, decision tree ensembles
such as gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and random forest are widely
applied powerful models with high interpretability and modeling efficiency.
However, the interpretability is compromised in state-of-the-art vertical
federated learning frameworks such as SecureBoost with anonymous features to
avoid possible data breaches. To address this issue in the inference process,
in this paper, we propose Fed-EINI to protect data privacy and allow the

determine associations between online shoppers' past lifestyle choices and
whether they suffered from a particular chronic disease or not. Novel lifestyle
risk factors were discovered in two exemplars -- depression and diabetes, most
of which showed cognitive congruence with existing healthcare knowledge.
Further, such empirical findings could be adopted to locate online shoppers at
high risk of these chronic diseases with fair accuracy, closely matching the

permit generalization in reinforcement learning in a wide variety of settings

both the optimal $Q$-function and the optimal $V$-function are linear in some

polynomial sample complexity for Bilinear Classes; notably, this sample
complexity is stated in terms of a reduction to the generalization error of an
underlying supervised learning sub-problem. These bounds nearly match the best
known sample complexity bounds for existing models. Furthermore, this framework
also extends to the infinite dimensional (RKHS) setting: for the the Linear

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning methods have shown suitability for time series classification
in the health and medical domain, with promising results for electrocardiogram
data classification. Successful identification of myocardial infarction holds
life saving potential and any meaningful improvement upon deep learning models
in this area is of great interest. Conventionally, data augmentation methods
are applied universally to the training set when data are limited in order to
ameliorate data resolution or sample size. In the method proposed in this
study, data augmentation was not applied in the context of data scarcity.
Instead, samples that yield low confidence predictions were selectively
augmented in order to bolster the model's sensitivity to features or patterns
less strongly associated with a given class. This approach was tested for
improving the performance of a Fully Convolutional Network. The proposed
approach achieved 90 percent accuracy for classifying myocardial infarction as
opposed to 82 percent accuracy for the baseline, a marked improvement. Further,
the accuracy of the proposed approach was optimal near a defined upper
threshold for qualifying low confidence samples and decreased as this threshold
was raised to include higher confidence samples. This suggests exclusively
selecting lower confidence samples for data augmentation comes with distinct
benefits for electrocardiogram data classification with Fully Convolutional
Networks.]]></summary>

the ensemble transformer directly outputs multivariate and spatially-coherent

capability to learn optimal policy in an end-to-end manner without relying on
feature engineering. However, most approaches assume a fully observable state
space, i.e. fully observable Markov Decision Process (MDP). In real-world
robotics, this assumption is unpractical, because of the sensor issues such as
sensors' capacity limitation and sensor noise, and the lack of knowledge about
if the observation design is complete or not. These scenarios lead to Partially
Observable MDP (POMDP) and need special treatment. In this paper, we propose
Long-Short-Term-Memory-based Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(LSTM-TD3) by introducing a memory component to TD3, and compare its
performance with other DRL algorithms in both MDPs and POMDPs. Our results
demonstrate the significant advantages of the memory component in addressing
POMDPs, including the ability to handle missing and noisy observation data.]]></summary>

that performing task-guided exploration provably improves on exploration

utilize complementary information from multiple views. However, there are few
methods to consider the negative impact caused by certain views with unclear
clustering structures, resulting in poor multi-view clustering performance. To
address this drawback, we propose self-supervised discriminative feature
learning for deep multi-view clustering (SDMVC). Concretely, deep autoencoders
are applied to learn embedded features for each view independently. To leverage
the multi-view complementary information, we concatenate all views' embedded
features to form the global features, which can overcome the negative impact of
some views' unclear clustering structures. In a self-supervised manner,
pseudo-labels are obtained to build a unified target distribution to perform
multi-view discriminative feature learning. During this process, global
discriminative information can be mined to supervise all views to learn more
discriminative features, which in turn are used to update the target
distribution. Besides, this unified target distribution can make SDMVC learn
consistent cluster assignments, which accomplishes the clustering consistency
of multiple views while preserving their features' diversity. Experiments on
various types of multi-view datasets show that SDMVC achieves state-of-the-art
performance.]]></summary>

self-supervised online reward shaping, yielding faster, sample efficient

between updating a policy and inferring a reward function. While the policy
update is performed with the inferred, potentially dense reward function, the
original sparse reward is used to provide a self-supervisory signal for the
reward update by serving as an ordering over the observed trajectories. The
proposed framework is based on the theory that altering the reward function
does not affect the optimal policy of the original MDP as long as certain
relations between the altered and the original reward are maintained. We name
the proposed framework ClAssification-based Reward Shaping (CaReS), since the
altered reward is learned in a self-supervised manner using classifier-based
reward inference. Experimental results on several sparse-reward environments
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is not only significantly more sample
efficient than the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning baseline but also
achieves a similar sample efficiency to a baseline that uses hand-designed

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This work considers clustering nodes of a largely incomplete graph. Under the
problem setting, only a small amount of queries about the edges can be made,
but the entire graph is not observable. This problem finds applications in
large-scale data clustering using limited annotations, community detection
under restricted survey resources, and graph topology inference under
hidden/removed node interactions. Prior works tackled this problem from various
perspectives, e.g., convex programming-based low-rank matrix completion and
active query-based clique finding. Nonetheless, many existing methods are
designed for estimating the single-cluster membership of the nodes, but nodes
may often have mixed (i.e., multi-cluster) membership in practice. Some query
and computational paradigms, e.g., the random query patterns and nuclear
norm-based optimization advocated in the convex approaches, may give rise to
scalability and implementation challenges. This work aims at learning mixed
membership of nodes using queried edges. The proposed method is developed
together with a systematic query principle that can be controlled and adjusted
by the system designers to accommodate implementation challenges -- e.g., to
avoid querying edges that are physically hard to acquire. Our framework also
features a lightweight and scalable algorithm with membership learning
guarantees. Real-data experiments on crowdclustering and community detection
are used to showcase the effectiveness of our method.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, many plug-and-play self-attention modules are proposed to enhance
the model generalization by exploiting the internal information of deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Previous works lay an emphasis on the
design of attention module for specific functionality, e.g., light-weighted or
task-oriented attention. However, they ignore the importance of where to plug
in the attention module since they connect the modules individually with each
block of the entire CNN backbone for granted, leading to incremental
computational cost and number of parameters with the growth of network depth.
Thus, we propose a framework called Efficient Attention Network (EAN) to
improve the efficiency for the existing attention modules. In EAN, we leverage
the sharing mechanism (Huang et al. 2020) to share the attention module within
the backbone and search where to connect the shared attention module via
reinforcement learning. Finally, we obtain the attention network with sparse
connections between the backbone and modules, while (1) maintaining accuracy
(2) reducing extra parameter increment and (3) accelerating inference.
Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks and popular attention networks
show the effectiveness of EAN. Furthermore, we empirically illustrate that our
EAN has the capacity of transferring to other tasks and capturing the
informative features. The code is available at

While the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, it
cannot be directly explained, posing a threat to the continuing democratization
of machine learning technology.

Tackling the challenge of model explainability, research has made significant
progress in demystifying the image classification models. In the same spirit of
these works, this paper studies code summarization models, particularly, given
an input program for which a model makes a prediction, our goal is to reveal
the key features that the model uses for predicting the label of the program.
We realize our approach in HouYi, which we use to evaluate four prominent code
summarization models: extreme summarizer, code2vec, code2seq, and sequence GNN.
Results show that all models base their predictions on syntactic and lexical
properties with little to none semantic implication. Based on this finding, we
present a novel approach to explaining the predictions of code summarization
models through the lens of training data.

Our work opens up this exciting, new direction of studying what models have
learned from source code.]]></summary>

Dictionary Learning approach, which uses the Gromov Wasserstein divergence for

dictionary elements, estimated thanks to an online stochastic algorithm, which
operates on a dataset of unregistered graphs with potentially different number
of nodes. Our approach naturally extends to labeled graphs, and is completed by
a novel upper bound that can be used as a fast approximation of Gromov

To find a unique solution, traditional ESI methods impose a variety of priors
that may not reflect the actual source properties. Such limitations of
traditional ESI methods hinder their further applications. Inspired by deep
learning approaches, a novel data-synthesized spatio-temporal denoising
autoencoder method (DST-DAE) method was proposed to solve the ESI inverse
problem. Unlike the traditional methods, we utilize a neural network to
directly seek generalized mapping from the measured E/MEG signals to the
cortical sources. A novel data synthesis strategy is employed by introducing
the prior information of sources to the generated large-scale samples using the
forward model of ESI. All the generated data are used to drive the neural
network to automatically learn inverse mapping. To achieve better estimation
performance, a denoising autoencoder (DAE) architecture with spatio-temporal
feature extraction blocks is designed. Compared with the traditional methods,
we show (1) that the novel deep learning approach provides an effective and
easy-to-apply way to solve the ESI problem, that (2) compared to traditional
methods, DST-DAE with the data synthesis strategy can better consider the
characteristics of real sources than the mathematical formulation of prior
assumptions, and that (3) the specifically designed architecture of DAE can not
only provide a better estimation of source signals but also be robust to noise
pollution. Extensive numerical experiments show that the proposed method is
superior to the traditional knowledge-driven ESI methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a tall $n\times d$ matrix $A$ and a random $m\times n$ sketching matrix
$S$, the sketched estimate of the inverse covariance matrix $(A^\top A)^{-1}$
is typically biased: $E[(\tilde A^\top\tilde A)^{-1}]\ne(A^\top A)^{-1}$, where
$\tilde A=SA$. This phenomenon, which we call inversion bias, arises, e.g., in
statistics and distributed optimization, when averaging multiple independently
constructed estimates of quantities that depend on the inverse covariance. We
develop a framework for analyzing inversion bias, based on our proposed concept
of an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-unbiased estimator for random matrices. We show that
when the sketching matrix $S$ is dense and has i.i.d. sub-gaussian entries,
then after simple rescaling, the estimator $(\frac m{m-d}\tilde A^\top\tilde
A)^{-1}$ is $(\epsilon,\delta)$-unbiased for $(A^\top A)^{-1}$ with a sketch of
size $m=O(d+\sqrt d/\epsilon)$. This implies that for $m=O(d)$, the inversion
bias of this estimator is $O(1/\sqrt d)$, which is much smaller than the
$\Theta(1)$ approximation error obtained as a consequence of the subspace
embedding guarantee for sub-gaussian sketches. We then propose a new sketching
technique, called LEverage Score Sparsified (LESS) embeddings, which uses ideas
from both data-oblivious sparse embeddings as well as data-aware leverage-based
row sampling methods, to get $\epsilon$ inversion bias for sketch size
$m=O(d\log d+\sqrt d/\epsilon)$ in time $O(\text{nnz}(A)\log n+md^2)$, where
nnz is the number of non-zeros. The key techniques enabling our analysis
include an extension of a classical inequality of Bai and Silverstein for
random quadratic forms, which we call the Restricted Bai-Silverstein
inequality; and anti-concentration of the Binomial distribution via the
Paley-Zygmund inequality, which we use to prove a lower bound showing that
leverage score sampling sketches generally do not achieve small inversion bias.]]></summary>

tasks involving semantic segmentation of images. CNNs are vulnerable in the
area of biomedical image segmentation because of distributional gap between two
source and target domains with different data modalities which leads to domain
shift. Domain shift makes data annotations in new modalities necessary because
models must be retrained from scratch. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is
proposed to adapt a model to new modalities using solely unlabeled target
domain data. Common UDA algorithms require access to data points in the source
domain which may not be feasible in medical imaging due to privacy concerns. In
this work, we develop an algorithm for UDA in a privacy-constrained setting,
where the source domain data is inaccessible. Our idea is based on encoding the
information from the source samples into a prototypical distribution that is
used as an intermediate distribution for aligning the target domain
distribution with the source domain distribution. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing it to state-of-the-art medical

First, we find that similar to network architecture search, Transformer growth
also favors compound scaling. Specifically, while existing methods only conduct
network growth in a single dimension, we observe that it is beneficial to use
compound growth operators and balance multiple dimensions (e.g., depth, width,
and input length of the model). Moreover, we explore alternative growth
operators in each dimension via controlled comparison to give operator
selection practical guidance. In light of our analyses, the proposed method

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Real-world classification problems typically exhibit an imbalanced or
long-tailed label distribution, wherein many labels are associated with only a
few samples. This poses a challenge for generalisation on such labels, and also
makes na\"ive learning biased towards dominant labels. In this paper, we
present two simple modifications of standard softmax cross-entropy training to
cope with these challenges. Our techniques revisit the classic idea of logit
adjustment based on the label frequencies, either applied post-hoc to a trained
model, or enforced in the loss during training. Such adjustment encourages a
large relative margin between logits of rare versus dominant labels. These
techniques unify and generalise several recent proposals in the literature,
while possessing firmer statistical grounding and empirical performance.]]></summary>

repeatedly querying only the most beneficial samples from unlabeled data. In
real-world problems where data cannot be stored indefinitely due to limited
storage or privacy issues, the query selection and the model update should be
performed as soon as a new data sample is observed. Various online active
learning methods have been studied to deal with these challenges; however,
there are difficulties in selecting representative query samples and updating
the model efficiently without forgetting. In this study, we propose Message
Passing Adaptive Resonance Theory (MPART) that learns the distribution and
topology of input data online. Through message passing on the topological
graph, MPART actively queries informative and representative samples, and
continuously improves the classification performance using both labeled and
unlabeled data. We evaluate our model in stream-based selective sampling
scenarios with comparable query selection strategies, showing that MPART
significantly outperforms competitive models.]]></summary>

across a wide range of tasks including the development of medical treatments,

challenges associated with undertaking causal inference using observational

and untreated groups), and an absence of counterfactual data (i.e., not knowing
what would have happened if an individual who did get treatment, were instead
to have not been treated). We address these two challenges by combining
structured inference and targeted learning. In terms of structure, we factorize
the joint distribution into risk, confounding, instrumental, and miscellaneous
factors, and in terms of targeted learning, we apply a regularizer derived from
the influence curve in order to reduce residual bias. An ablation study is
undertaken, and an evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that TVAE has

their proven ability to surpass state-of-the-art classical image denoising

residual learning to improve denoising performance significantly. However, this

we address this issue by reducing the number of parameters while achieving a

show that by using RBM-Flow we are able to improve the quality of samples

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Artificial) neural networks have become increasingly popular in mechanics to
accelerate computations with model order reduction techniques and as universal
models for a wide variety of materials. However, the major disadvantage of
neural networks remains: their numerous parameters are challenging to interpret
and explain. Thus, neural networks are often labeled as black boxes, and their
results often elude human interpretation. In mechanics, the new and active
field of physics-informed neural networks attempts to mitigate this
disadvantage by designing deep neural networks on the basis of mechanical
knowledge. By using this a priori knowledge, deeper and more complex neural
networks became feasible, since the mechanical assumptions could be explained.
However, the internal reasoning and explanation of neural network parameters
remain mysterious.

Complementary to the physics-informed approach, we propose a first step
towards a physics-informing approach, which explains neural networks trained on
mechanical data a posteriori. This novel explainable artificial intelligence
approach aims at elucidating the black box of neural networks and their
high-dimensional representations. Therein, the principal component analysis
decorrelates the distributed representations in cell states of RNNs and allows
the comparison to known and fundamental functions. The novel approach is
supported by a systematic hyperparameter search strategy that identifies the
best neural network architectures and training parameters. The findings of
three case studies on fundamental constitutive models (hyperelasticity,
elastoplasticity, and viscoelasticity) imply that the proposed strategy can
help identify numerical and analytical closed-form solutions to characterize
new materials.]]></summary>

that gaining robustness means losing accuracy. It is also generally believed
that, unless making networks larger, network architectural elements would
otherwise matter little in improving adversarial robustness. Here we present
evidence to challenge these common beliefs by a careful study about adversarial
training. Our key observation is that the widely-used ReLU activation function
significantly weakens adversarial training due to its non-smooth nature. Hence
we propose smooth adversarial training (SAT), in which we replace ReLU with its
smooth approximations to strengthen adversarial training. The purpose of smooth
activation functions in SAT is to allow it to find harder adversarial examples
and compute better gradient updates during adversarial training.

Compared to standard adversarial training, SAT improves adversarial
robustness for "free", i.e., no drop in accuracy and no increase in
computational cost. For example, without introducing additional computations,
SAT significantly enhances ResNet-50's robustness from 33.0% to 42.3%, while

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Millimeter wave (mmWave) beam-tracking based on machine learning enables the
development of accurate tracking policies while obviating the need to
periodically solve beam-optimization problems. However, its applicability is
still arguable when training-test gaps exist in terms of environmental
parameters that affect the node dynamics. From this skeptical point of view,
the contribution of this study is twofold. First, by considering an example
scenario, we confirm that the training-test gap adversely affects the
beam-tracking performance. More specifically, we consider nodes placed on
overhead messenger wires, where the node dynamics are affected by several
environmental parameters, e.g, the wire mass and tension. Although these are
particular scenarios, they yield insight into the validation of the
training-test gap problems. Second, we demonstrate the feasibility of
\textit{zero-shot adaptation} as a solution, where a learning agent adapts to
environmental parameters unseen during training. This is achieved by leveraging
a robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL) technique, where such
training-and-test gaps are regarded as disturbances by adversaries that are
jointly trained with a legitimate beam-tracking agent. Numerical evaluations
demonstrate that the beam-tracking policy learned via RARL can be applied to a
wide range of environmental parameters without severely degrading the received
power.]]></summary>

deep-learning-based automatic sleep scoring from being used in clinical
environments. Towards interpretability, this work proposes a
sequence-to-sequence sleep-staging model, namely SleepTransformer. It is based
on the transformer backbone whose self-attention scores offer interpretability
of the model's decisions at both the epoch and sequence level. At the epoch
level, the attention scores can be encoded as a heat map to highlight
sleep-relevant features captured from the input EEG signal. At the sequence
level, the attention scores are visualized as the influence of different
neighboring epochs in an input sequence (i.e. the context) to recognition of a
target epoch, mimicking the way manual scoring is done by human experts. We
further propose a simple yet efficient method to quantify uncertainty in the
model's decisions. The method, which is based on entropy, can serve as a metric
for deferring low-confidence epochs to a human expert for further inspection.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed SleepTransformer outperforms
existing methods at a lower computational cost and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two experimental databases of different sizes.]]></summary>

quality of the performed actions. However, in many applications, such feedback
is restricted. For example, in recommendation systems, repeatedly asking the
user to provide feedback on the quality of recommendations will annoy them. In
this work, we formalize decision-making problems with querying budget, where
there is a (possibly time-dependent) hard limit on the number of reward queries
allowed. Specifically, we consider multi-armed bandits, linear bandits, and
reinforcement learning problems. We start by analyzing the performance of
`greedy' algorithms that query a reward whenever they can. We show that in
fully stochastic settings, doing so performs surprisingly well, but in the
presence of any adversity, this might lead to linear regret. To overcome this
issue, we propose the Confidence-Budget Matching (CBM) principle that queries
rewards when the confidence intervals are wider than the inverse square root of
the available budget. We analyze the performance of CBM based algorithms in
different settings and show that they perform well in the presence of adversity
in the contexts, initial states, and budgets.]]></summary>

that the MMD test is unaware of adversarial attacks -- the MMD test failed to

phenomenon, we raise a question: are natural and adversarial data really from
different distributions? The answer is affirmative -- the previous use of the
MMD test on the purpose missed three key factors, and accordingly, we propose
three components. Firstly, the Gaussian kernel has limited representation
power, and we replace it with an effective deep kernel. Secondly, the test
power of the MMD test was neglected, and we maximize it following asymptotic
statistics. Finally, adversarial data may be non-independent, and we overcome
this issue with the wild bootstrap. By taking care of the three factors, we
verify that the MMD test is aware of adversarial attacks, which lights up a
novel road for adversarial data detection based on two-sample tests.]]></summary>

computation of neural networks, which is usually achieved by adding
perturbations to reduce network parameters at the cost of slightly increasing
training loss. A more reasonable approach is to find a sparse minimizer along
the flat minimum valley found by optimizers, i.e. stochastic gradient descent,
which keeps the training loss constant. To achieve this goal, we propose the
structured directional pruning based on orthogonal projecting the perturbations
onto the flat minimum valley. We also propose a fast solver sDprun and further
prove that it achieves directional pruning asymptotically after sufficient
training. Experiments using VGG-Net and ResNet on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets show that our method obtains the state-of-the-art pruned accuracy
(i.e. 93.97% on VGG16, CIFAR-10 task) without retraining. Experiments using
DNN, VGG-Net and WRN28X10 on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate
our method performs structured directional pruning, reaching the same minimum

pose challenges in various domains. Granger causality is a practical framework
for analyzing the interactions from observed time-series data; however, this
framework ignores the structures of the generative process in animal behaviors,
which may lead to interpretational problems and sometimes erroneous assessments
of causality. In this paper, we propose a new framework for learning Granger
causality from multi-animal trajectories via augmented theory-based behavioral
models with interpretable data-driven models. We adopt an approach for
augmenting incomplete multi-agent behavioral models described by time-varying
dynamical systems with neural networks. For efficient and interpretable
learning, our model leverages theory-based architectures separating navigation
and motion processes, and the theory-guided regularization for reliable
behavioral modeling. This can provide interpretable signs of Granger-causal
effects over time, i.e., when specific others cause the approach or separation.
In experiments using synthetic datasets, our method achieved better performance
than various baselines. We then analyzed multi-animal datasets of mice, flies,
birds, and bats, which verified our method and obtained novel biological

scientific disciplines. We introduce a novel load forecasting method in which
observed dynamics are modeled as a forced linear system using Dynamic Mode
Decomposition (DMD) in time delay coordinates. Central to this approach is the
insight that grid load, like many observables on complex real-world systems,
has an "almost-periodic" character, i.e., a continuous Fourier spectrum
punctuated by dominant peaks, which capture regular (e.g., daily or weekly)
recurrences in the dynamics. The forecasting method presented takes advantage
of this property by (i) regressing to a deterministic linear model whose
eigenspectrum maps onto those peaks, and (ii) simultaneously learning a
stochastic Gaussian process regression (GPR) process to actuate this system.
Our forecasting algorithm is compared against state-of-the-art forecasting
techniques not using additional explanatory variables and is shown to produce
superior performance. Moreover, its use of linear intrinsic dynamics offers a
number of desirable properties in terms of interpretability and parsimony.
Results are presented for a test case using load data from an electrical grid.
Load forecasting is an essential challenge in power systems engineering, with
major implications for real-time control, pricing, maintenance, and security

credibility in high stakes settings, it is important to ensure that these
explanations are accurate and reliable. However, prior work demonstrates that
explanations generated by state-of-the-art techniques are inconsistent,
unstable, and provide very little insight into their correctness and
reliability. In addition, these methods are also computationally inefficient,
and require significant hyper-parameter tuning. In this paper, we address the
aforementioned challenges by developing a novel Bayesian framework for
generating local explanations along with their associated uncertainty. We
instantiate this framework to obtain Bayesian versions of LIME and KernelSHAP
which output credible intervals for the feature importances, capturing the
associated uncertainty. The resulting explanations not only enable us to make
concrete inferences about their quality (e.g., there is a 95\% chance that the
feature importance lies within the given range), but are also highly consistent
and stable. We carry out a detailed theoretical analysis that leverages the
aforementioned uncertainty to estimate how many perturbations to sample, and
how to sample for faster convergence. This work makes the first attempt at
addressing several critical issues with popular explanation methods in one

graph convolutional network (GCN) and its variants have been successfully
applied to a broad range of tasks, such as node classification, link
prediction, and graph classification. Traditional GCN models suffer from the
issues of overfitting and oversmoothing, while some recent techniques like
DropEdge could alleviate these issues and thus enable the development of deep
GCN. However, training GCN models is non-trivial, as it is sensitive to the
choice of hyperparameters such as dropout rate and learning weight decay,
especially for deep GCN models. In this paper, we aim to automate the training
of GCN models through hyperparameter optimization. To be specific, we propose a
self-tuning GCN approach with an alternate training algorithm, and further
extend our approach by incorporating the population based training scheme.
Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approaches on optimizing multi-layer GCN, compared with several
representative baselines.]]></summary>

through many techniques. In this work, we revisit Laplace approximation, a
classical approach for posterior approximation that is computationally
attractive. However, instead of computing the curvature matrix, we show that,
under some regularity conditions, the Laplace approximation can be easily
constructed using the gradient second moment. This quantity is already
estimated by many exponential moving average variants of Adagrad such as Adam
and RMSprop, but is traditionally discarded after training. We show that our
method (L2M) does not require changes in models or optimization, can be
implemented in a few lines of code to yield reasonable results, and it does not
require any extra computational steps besides what is already being computed by
optimizers, without introducing any new hyperparameter. We hope our method can

for pre-training speech representation models. The utility of these learned

capabilities and limits of these models and enable the research community to
more efficiently develop their usage for downstream applications. In this work,
we begin to fill this gap by examining one recent and successful pre-trained
model (wav2vec 2.0), via its intermediate representation vectors, using a suite
of analysis tools. We use the metrics of canonical correlation, mutual
information, and performance on simple downstream tasks with non-parametric
probes, in order to (i) query for acoustic and linguistic information content,
(ii) characterize the evolution of information across model layers, and (iii)
understand how fine-tuning the model for automatic speech recognition (ASR)
affects these observations. Our findings motivate modifying the fine-tuning
protocol for ASR, which produces improved word error rates in a low-resource

concepts. Deep learning classifiers link the most basic version of concepts at
the input layer to the most abstract version of concepts at the output layer,
also known as a class or label. However, once trained over a finite set of
classes, a deep learning model does not have the power to say that a given
input does not belong to any of the classes and simply cannot be linked.
Correctly invalidating the prediction of unrelated classes is a challenging
problem that has been tackled in many ways in the literature. Novelty detection
gives deep learning the ability to output "do not know" for novel/unseen
classes. Still, no attention has been given to the security aspects of novelty
detection. In this paper, we consider the case study of abstraction-based
novelty detection and show that it is not robust against adversarial samples.
Moreover, we show the feasibility of crafting adversarial samples that fool the
deep learning classifier and bypass the novelty detection monitoring at the
same time. In other words, these monitoring boxes are hackable. We demonstrate
that novelty detection itself ends up as an attack surface.]]></summary>

distribution over possible futures given a particular sample. In addition, we
leverage the changes in this distribution over time to control the sampling of
diverse future states by estimating the end of ongoing sequences. That is, we

autonomous cars to drive safely, which often employs spherical projection to
map 3D point cloud into multi-channel 2D images for semantic segmentation. Most
existing methods simply stack different point attributes/modalities (e.g.
coordinates, intensity, depth, etc.) as image channels to increase information
capacity, but ignore distinct characteristics of point attributes in different
image channels. We design FPS-Net, a convolutional fusion network that exploits
the uniqueness and discrepancy among the projected image channels for optimal
point cloud segmentation. FPS-Net adopts an encoder-decoder structure. Instead
of simply stacking multiple channel images as a single input, we group them
into different modalities to first learn modality-specific features separately
and then map the learned features into a common high-dimensional feature space
for pixel-level fusion and learning. Specifically, we design a residual dense
block with multiple receptive fields as a building block in the encoder which
preserves detailed information in each modality and learns hierarchical
modality-specific and fused features effectively. In the FPS-Net decoder, we
use a recurrent convolution block likewise to hierarchically decode fused
features into output space for pixel-level classification. Extensive
experiments conducted on two widely adopted point cloud datasets show that
FPS-Net achieves superior semantic segmentation as compared with
state-of-the-art projection-based methods. In addition, the proposed modality
fusion idea is compatible with typical projection-based methods and can be
incorporated into them with consistent performance improvements.]]></summary>

influential in both computer vision and in recognizing patterns extended over
time. In computer vision, part of the flexibility arises from the use of
max-pooling operations over the convolutions to attain translation invariance.
In the mammalian brain, neural representations of time use a set of temporal
basis functions. Critically, these basis functions appear to be arranged in a
geometric series such that the basis set is evenly distributed over logarithmic
time. This paper introduces a Scale-Invariant Temporal History Convolution
network (SITHCon) that uses a logarithmically-distributed temporal memory. A
max-pool over a logarithmically-distributed temporal memory results in
scale-invariance in time. We compare performance of SITHCon to a Temporal
Convolution Network (TCN) and demonstrate that, although both networks can
learn classification and regression problems on both univariate and
multivariate time series $f(t)$, only SITHCon has the property that it
generalizes without retraining to rescaled versions of the input $f(at)$. This
property, inspired by findings from neuroscience and psychology, could lead to
large-scale networks with dramatically different capabilities, including faster
training and greater generalizability, even with significantly fewer free

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Training and using modern neural-network based latent-variable generative
models (like Variational Autoencoders) often require simultaneously training a
generative direction along with an inferential(encoding) direction, which
approximates the posterior distribution over the latent variables. Thus, the
question arises: how complex does the inferential model need to be, in order to
be able to accurately model the posterior distribution of a given generative
model?

In this paper, we identify an important property of the generative map
impacting the required size of the encoder. We show that if the generative map
is "strongly invertible" (in a sense we suitably formalize), the inferential
model need not be much more complex. Conversely, we prove that there exist
non-invertible generative maps, for which the encoding direction needs to be
exponentially larger (under standard assumptions in computational complexity).
Importantly, we do not require the generative model to be layerwise invertible,
which a lot of the related literature assumes and isn't satisfied by many
architectures used in practice (e.g. convolution and pooling based networks).
Thus, we provide theoretical support for the empirical wisdom that learning
deep generative models is harder when data lies on a low-dimensional manifold.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper presents a novel active marker for dynamic projection mapping (PM)
that emits a temporal blinking pattern of infrared (IR) light representing its
ID. We used a multi-material three dimensional (3D) printer to fabricate a
projection object with optical fibers that can guide IR light from LEDs
attached on the bottom of the object. The aperture of an optical fiber is
typically very small; thus, it is unnoticeable to human observers under
projection and can be placed on a strongly curved part of a projection surface.
In addition, the working range of our system can be larger than previous
marker-based methods as the blinking patterns can theoretically be recognized
by a camera placed at a wide range of distances from markers. We propose an
automatic marker placement algorithm to spread multiple active markers over the
surface of a projection object such that its pose can be robustly estimated
using captured images from arbitrary directions. We also propose an
optimization framework for determining the routes of the optical fibers in such
a way that collisions of the fibers can be avoided while minimizing the loss of
light intensity in the fibers. Through experiments conducted using three
fabricated objects containing strongly curved surfaces, we confirmed that the
proposed method can achieve accurate dynamic PMs in a significantly wide
working range.]]></summary>

adversarial attacks on automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Adversarial
attacks attempt to force misclassification by adding small perturbations to the

neural-network based denoiser as a pre-processor in the ASR pipeline. The
denoiser is independent of the downstream ASR model, and thus can be rapidly
deployed in existing systems. We found that training the denoisier using a
perceptually motivated loss function resulted in increased adversarial
robustness without compromising ASR performance on benign samples. Our defense
was evaluated (as a part of the DARPA GARD program) on the 'Kenansville' attack

computation of Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) has high computational/space
complexity; ii) recent vision transformer networks are overly tuned for image
classification, ignoring the difference between image classification (simple
scenarios, more similar to NLP) and downstream scene understanding tasks
(complicated scenarios, rich structural and contextual information). To this
end, we note that pyramid pooling has been demonstrated to be effective in
various vision tasks owing to its powerful ability in context abstraction, and
its natural property of spatial invariance is also suitable to address the loss
of structural information (problem ii)). Hence, we propose to adapt pyramid
pooling to MHSA for alleviating its high requirement on computational resources
(problem i)). In this way, this pooling-based MHSA can well address the above
two problems and is thus flexible and powerful for downstream scene
understanding tasks. Plugged with our pooling-based MHSA, we build a
downstream-task-oriented transformer network, dubbed Pyramid Pooling
Transformer (P2T). Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when applied P2T as
the backbone network, it shows substantial superiority in various downstream
scene understanding tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection,
instance segmentation, and visual saliency detection, compared to previous CNN-

the classes they have been trained for. Runtime monitoring techniques on the
neuron activation pattern can be used to detect such inputs. We present an
approach for monitoring classification systems via data abstraction. Data
abstraction relies on the notion of box with a resolution. Box-based
abstraction consists in representing a set of values by its minimal and maximal
values in each dimension. We augment boxes with a notion of resolution and
define their clustering coverage, which is intuitively a quantitative metric
that indicates the abstraction quality. This allows studying the effect of
different clustering parameters on the constructed boxes and estimating an
interval of sub-optimal parameters. Moreover, we automatically construct
monitors that leverage both the correct and incorrect behaviors of a system.
This allows checking the size of the monitor abstractions and analyzing the
separability of the network. Monitors are obtained by combining the
sub-monitors of each class of the system placed at some selected layers. Our
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our clustering coverage estimation
and show how to assess the effectiveness and precision of monitors according to
the selected clustering parameter and monitored layers.]]></summary>

augment the state space of the underlying decision process, thereby
facilitating non-Markovian reinforcement learning. However, these reward
machines cannot capture the semantics of stochastic reward signals. In this

whose advances bring consistent performance gains through exploring more
effective network structures. In this paper, we propose a novel and flexible
backbone framework, namely CBNetV2, to better train existing open-sourced
pre-trained backbones under the pre-training fine-tuning protocol. In
particular, CBNetV2 architecture groups multiple identical backbones, which are
connected through composite connections. Specifically, it integrates the high-
and low-level features of multiple backbone networks and gradually expands the
receptive field to more efficiently perform object detection. We also propose a
better training strategy with assistant supervision for CBNet-based detectors.
CBNetV2 has strong generalization capabilities for different backbones and head
designs of the detector architecture. Without additional pre-training, CBNetV2
can be adapted to various backbones, including manual-based and NAS-based, as
well as CNN-based and Transformer-based ones. Experiments provide strong
evidence showing that composite backbones are more efficient, effective, and
resource-friendly than wider and deeper networks. CBNetV2 is compatible with
the head designs of most mainstream detectors, including one-stage and
two-stage detectors, as well as anchor-based and anchor-free-based ones, and
significantly improve their performances by more than 3.0% AP over the baseline
on COCO. Particularly, under the single-model and single-scale testing
protocol, our Dual-Swin-L achieves 59.4% box AP and 51.6% mask AP on COCO
test-dev, which is significantly better than the state-of-the-art result (i.e.,
57.7% box AP and 50.2% mask AP). Code is available at

To compute the gradients required to update parameters, backpropagation blocks
computations until the forward and backward passes are completed. For temporal
signals, this introduces high latency and hinders real-time learning. It also
creates a coupling between consecutive layers, which limits model parallelism
and increases memory consumption. In this paper, we build upon Sideways, which
avoids blocking by propagating approximate gradients forward in time, and we
propose mechanisms for temporal integration of information based on different
variants of skip connections. We also show how to decouple computation and
delegate individual neural modules to different devices, allowing distributed
and parallel training. The proposed Skip-Sideways achieves low latency
training, model parallelism, and, importantly, is capable of extracting
temporal features, leading to more stable training and improved performance on
real-world action recognition video datasets such as HMDB51, UCF101, and the
large-scale Kinetics-600. Finally, we also show that models trained with
Skip-Sideways generate better future frames than Sideways models, and hence
they can better utilize motion cues.]]></summary>

task in computer vision due to variant backgrounds, low-quality facial images,
and the subjectiveness of annotators. These uncertainties make it difficult for
neural networks to learn robust features on limited-scale datasets. Moreover,
the networks can be easily distributed by the above factors and perform
incorrect decisions. Recently, vision transformer (ViT) and data-efficient
image transformers (DeiT) present their significant performance in traditional

consists of two modules: a transformer-based mask generation network (MGN) to
generate a mask that can filter out complex backgrounds and occlusion of face
images, and a dynamic relabeling module to rectify incorrect labels in FER
datasets in the wild. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our MVT
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RAF-DB with 88.62%, FERPlus with

errors. Unlike images that contain rich texture features, point clouds are
almost pure geometric information which makes place recognition based on point

to represent scenes. Besides, they often ignore the translation between point
clouds when matching descriptors. Different from most existing methods, we
explore the use of high-level features, namely semantics, to improve the
descriptor's representation ability. Also, when matching descriptors, we try to
correct the translation between point clouds to improve accuracy. Concretely,
we propose a novel global descriptor, Semantic Scan Context, which explores
semantic information to represent scenes more effectively. We also present a
two-step global semantic ICP to obtain the 3D pose (x, y, yaw) used to align

standard feature. One of the foremost outstanding hurdles is to obtain robust
visual perception in harsh weather and low light conditions where accuracy
degradation is severe. It is critical to have a weather classification model to
decrease visual perception confidence during these scenarios. Thus, we have
built a new dataset for weather (fog, rain, and snow) classification and light
level (bright, moderate, and low) classification. Furthermore, we provide
street type (asphalt, grass, and cobblestone) classification, leading to 9
labels. Each image has three labels corresponding to weather, light level, and
street type. We recorded the data utilizing an industrial front camera of RCCC
(red/clear) format with a resolution of $1024\times1084$. We collected 15k
video sequences and sampled 60k images. We implement an active learning
framework to reduce the dataset's redundancy and find the optimal set of frames
for training a model. We distilled the 60k images further to 1.1k images, which
will be shared publicly after privacy anonymization. There is no public dataset
for weather and light level classification focused on autonomous driving to the
best of our knowledge. The baseline ResNet18 network used for weather
classification achieves state-of-the-art results in two non-automotive weather
classification public datasets but significantly lower accuracy on our proposed
dataset, demonstrating it is not saturated and needs further research.]]></summary>

learning predictions. This interest is reflected by a relatively young
literature with already dozens of algorithms aiming to generate such

objective can be achieved in different ways, which brings about the need for a
methodology to test and benchmark these algorithms. The contributions of this
work are manifold: First, a large benchmarking study of 10 algorithmic
approaches on 22 tabular datasets is performed, using 9 relevant evaluation
metrics. Second, the introduction of a novel, first of its kind, framework to
test counterfactual generation algorithms. Third, a set of objective metrics to
evaluate and compare counterfactual results. And finally, insight from the
benchmarking results that indicate which approaches obtain the best performance
on what type of dataset. This benchmarking study and framework can help
practitioners in determining which technique and building blocks most suit
their context, and can help researchers in the design and evaluation of current

of marine and terrestrial ecosystems. However, due to the complex environment,
severe vegetation mixture, and difficulty of access, it is impossible to
accurately classify coastal wetlands and identify their species with
traditional classifiers. Despite the integration of multisource remote sensing
data for performance enhancement, there are still challenges with acquiring and
exploiting the complementary merits from multisource data. In this paper, the
Deepwise Feature Interaction Network (DFINet) is proposed for wetland
classification. A depthwise cross attention module is designed to extract
self-correlation and cross-correlation from multisource feature pairs. In this
way, meaningful complementary information is emphasized for classification.
DFINet is optimized by coordinating consistency loss, discrimination loss, and
classification loss. Accordingly, DFINet reaches the standard solution-space
under the regularity of loss functions, while the spatial consistency and
feature discrimination are preserved. Comprehensive experimental results on two
hyperspectral and multispectral wetland datasets demonstrate that the proposed
DFINet outperforms other competitive methods in terms of overall accuracy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By adding human-imperceptible perturbations to images, DNNs can be easily
fooled. As one of the mainstream methods, feature space targeted attacks
perturb images by modulating their intermediate feature maps, for the
discrepancy between the intermediate source and target features is minimized.
However, the current choice of pixel-wise Euclidean Distance to measure the
discrepancy is questionable because it unreasonably imposes a
spatial-consistency constraint on the source and target features. Intuitively,
an image can be categorized as "cat" no matter the cat is on the left or right
of the image. To address this issue, we propose to measure this discrepancy
using statistic alignment. Specifically, we design two novel approaches called
Pair-wise Alignment Attack and Global-wise Alignment Attack, which attempt to
measure similarities between feature maps by high-order statistics with
translation invariance. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the layer-wise
transferability with varied difficulties to obtain highly reliable attacks.
Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, and it
outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin. Our code is

our method is highly scalable (can be used for cell networks consist of

a Dirichlet distribution whose parameters are determined through non-parametric

these are similar to those previously learnt. The proposed Lifelong mixture of
VAE (L-MVAE) expands its architecture with new components when learning a
completely new task. After the training, our model can automatically determine
the relevant expert to be used when fed with new data samples. This mechanism
benefits both the memory efficiency and the required computational cost as only
one expert is used during the inference. The L-MVAE inference model is able to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Low-light imaging on mobile devices is typically challenging due to
insufficient incident light coming through the relatively small aperture,
resulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio. Most of the previous works on
low-light image processing focus either only on a single task such as
illumination adjustment, color enhancement, or noise removal; or on a joint
illumination adjustment and denoising task that heavily relies on short-long
exposure image pairs collected from specific camera models, and thus these
approaches are less practical and generalizable in real-world settings where
camera-specific joint enhancement and restoration is required. To tackle this
problem, in this paper, we propose a low-light image processing framework that
performs joint illumination adjustment, color enhancement, and denoising.
Considering the difficulty in model-specific data collection and the ultra-high
definition of the captured images, we design two branches: a coefficient
estimation branch as well as a joint enhancement and denoising branch. The
coefficient estimation branch works in a low-resolution space and predicts the
coefficients for enhancement via bilateral learning, whereas the joint
enhancement and denoising branch works in a full-resolution space and
progressively performs joint enhancement and denoising. In contrast to existing
methods, our framework does not need to recollect massive data when being
adapted to another camera model, which significantly reduces the efforts
required to fine-tune our approach for practical usage. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate its great potential in real-world low-light imaging
applications when compared with current state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

leverage the power of AI models for clinical decision support. For medical
images, saliency maps are the most common form of explanation. The maps
highlight important features for AI model's prediction. Although many saliency
map methods have been proposed, it is unknown how well they perform on
explaining decisions on multi-modal medical images, where each modality/channel
carries distinct clinical meanings of the same underlying biomedical
phenomenon. Understanding such modality-dependent features is essential for
clinical users' interpretation of AI decisions. To tackle this clinically
important but technically ignored problem, we propose the MSFI
(Modality-Specific Feature Importance) metric to examine whether saliency maps
can highlight modality-specific important features. MSFI encodes the clinical
requirements on modality prioritization and modality-specific feature
localization. Our evaluations on 16 commonly used saliency map methods,
including a clinician user study, show that although most saliency map methods
captured modality importance information in general, most of them failed to
highlight modality-specific important features consistently and precisely. The
evaluation results guide the choices of saliency map methods and provide

a pseudo ground truth learning procedure. The base model training encourages
the model to predict reliable predictions based on single modality (i.e., RGB

benchmark for autonomous driving. While there is a growing body of ML-based
motion planners, the lack of established datasets and metrics has limited the

prediction have focused on short-term motion forecasting, rather than long-term
planning. This has led previous works to use open-loop evaluation with L2-based
metrics, which are not suitable for fairly evaluating long-term planning. Our
benchmark overcomes these limitations by introducing a large-scale driving
dataset, lightweight closed-loop simulator, and motion-planning-specific
metrics. We provide a high-quality dataset with 1500h of human driving data
from 4 cities across the US and Asia with widely varying traffic patterns
(Boston, Pittsburgh, Las Vegas and Singapore). We will provide a closed-loop

normal constraints. Existing depth estimation methods either suffer from the
lack of geometric constraints, or are limited to the difficulty of reliably
capturing geometric context, which leads to a bottleneck of depth estimation
quality. We therefore introduce a simple yet effective method, named Adaptive
Surface Normal (ASN) constraint, to effectively correlate the depth estimation
with geometric consistency. Our key idea is to adaptively determine the
reliable local geometry from a set of randomly sampled candidates to derive
surface normal constraint, for which we measure the consistency of the
geometric contextual features. As a result, our method can faithfully
reconstruct the 3D geometry and is robust to local shape variations, such as
boundaries, sharp corners and noises. We conduct extensive evaluations and
comparisons using public datasets. The experimental results demonstrate our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and has superior efficiency and

autonomous driving particularly for long range sensing. Most of the research is
focused on achieving higher accuracy and these models are not optimized for
deployment on embedded systems from the perspective of latency and power
efficiency. For high speed driving scenarios, latency is a crucial parameter as
it provides more time to react to dangerous situations. Typically a voxel or
point-cloud based 3D convolution approach is utilized for this module. Firstly,
they are inefficient on embedded platforms as they are not suitable for
efficient parallelization. Secondly, they have a variable runtime due to level
of sparsity of the scene which is against the determinism needed in a safety
system. In this work, we aim to develop a very low latency algorithm with fixed
runtime. We propose a novel semantic segmentation architecture as a single
unified model for object center detection using key points, box predictions and
orientation prediction using binned classification in a simpler Bird's Eye View
(BEV) 2D representation. The proposed architecture can be trivially extended to
include semantic segmentation classes like road without any additional
computation. The proposed model has a latency of 4 ms on the embedded Nvidia
Xavier platform. The model is 5X faster than other top accuracy models with a
minimal accuracy degradation of 2% in Average Precision at IoU=0.5 on KITTI

tasks involving semantic segmentation of images. CNNs are vulnerable in the
area of biomedical image segmentation because of distributional gap between two
source and target domains with different data modalities which leads to domain
shift. Domain shift makes data annotations in new modalities necessary because
models must be retrained from scratch. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is
proposed to adapt a model to new modalities using solely unlabeled target
domain data. Common UDA algorithms require access to data points in the source
domain which may not be feasible in medical imaging due to privacy concerns. In
this work, we develop an algorithm for UDA in a privacy-constrained setting,
where the source domain data is inaccessible. Our idea is based on encoding the
information from the source samples into a prototypical distribution that is
used as an intermediate distribution for aligning the target domain
distribution with the source domain distribution. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing it to state-of-the-art medical
image semantic segmentation approaches on two medical image semantic
segmentation datasets.]]></summary>

significance for a wide range of applications, which simultaneously brings an
urgent demand of large, challenging, and comprehensive benchmarks for the
development and evaluation of UAV-based models. However, existing benchmarks
have limitations in terms of the amount of captured data, types of data
modalities, categories of provided tasks, and diversities of subjects and
environments. Here we propose a new benchmark - UAVHuman - for human behavior
understanding with UAVs, which contains 67,428 multi-modal video sequences and
119 subjects for action recognition, 22,476 frames for pose estimation, 41,290
frames and 1,144 identities for person re-identification, and 22,263 frames for
attribute recognition. Our dataset was collected by a flying UAV in multiple
urban and rural districts in both daytime and nighttime over three months,
hence covering extensive diversities w.r.t subjects, backgrounds,
illuminations, weathers, occlusions, camera motions, and UAV flying attitudes.
Such a comprehensive and challenging benchmark shall be able to promote the
research of UAV-based human behavior understanding, including action
recognition, pose estimation, re-identification, and attribute recognition.
Furthermore, we propose a fisheye-based action recognition method that
mitigates the distortions in fisheye videos via learning unbounded
transformations guided by flat RGB videos. Experiments show the efficacy of our
method on the UAV-Human dataset. The project page:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modern change detection (CD) has achieved remarkable success by the powerful
discriminative ability of deep convolutions. However, high-resolution remote
sensing CD remains challenging due to the complexity of objects in the scene.
Objects with the same semantic concept may show distinct spectral
characteristics at different times and spatial locations. Most recent CD
pipelines using pure convolutions are still struggling to relate long-range
concepts in space-time. Non-local self-attention approaches show promising
performance via modeling dense relations among pixels, yet are computationally
inefficient. Here, we propose a bitemporal image transformer (BIT) to
efficiently and effectively model contexts within the spatial-temporal domain.
Our intuition is that the high-level concepts of the change of interest can be
represented by a few visual words, i.e., semantic tokens. To achieve this, we
express the bitemporal image into a few tokens, and use a transformer encoder
to model contexts in the compact token-based space-time. The learned
context-rich tokens are then feedback to the pixel-space for refining the
original features via a transformer decoder. We incorporate BIT in a deep
feature differencing-based CD framework. Extensive experiments on three CD
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.
Notably, our BIT-based model significantly outperforms the purely convolutional
baseline using only 3 times lower computational costs and model parameters.
Based on a naive backbone (ResNet18) without sophisticated structures (e.g.,
FPN, UNet), our model surpasses several state-of-the-art CD methods, including
better than four recent attention-based methods in terms of efficiency and
accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/justchenhao/BIT\_CD.]]></summary>

typically trained on a large amount of image data. By minimizing the
cross-entropy loss between a prediction and a given class label, the NN and its
visual embedding space are learned to fulfill a given task. However, due to the
sole dependence on the image data distribution of the training domain, these
models tend to fail when applied to a target domain that differs from their
source domain. To learn a more robust NN to domain shifts, we propose the
knowledge graph neural network (KG-NN), a neuro-symbolic approach that
supervises the training using image-data-invariant auxiliary knowledge. The
auxiliary knowledge is first encoded in a knowledge graph with respective
concepts and their relationships, which is then transformed into a dense vector
representation via an embedding method. Using a contrastive loss function,
KG-NN learns to adapt its visual embedding space and thus its weights according
to the image-data invariant knowledge graph embedding space. We evaluate KG-NN
on visual transfer learning tasks for classification using the mini-ImageNet
dataset and its derivatives, as well as road sign recognition datasets from
Germany and China. The results show that a visual model trained with a
knowledge graph as a trainer outperforms a model trained with cross-entropy in
all experiments, in particular when the domain gap increases. Besides better
performance and stronger robustness to domain shifts, these KG-NN adapts to
multiple datasets and classes without suffering heavily from catastrophic
forgetting.]]></summary>

has been significantly prospered by recent advances in convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). However, it exhibits general limitations on modeling explicit
long-range relation, and existing cures, resorting to building deep encoders
along with aggressive downsampling operations, leads to redundant deepened
networks and loss of localized details. Hence, the segmentation task awaits a
better solution to improve the efficiency of modeling global contexts while
maintaining a strong grasp of low-level details. In this paper, we propose a
novel parallel-in-branch architecture, TransFuse, to address this challenge.
TransFuse combines Transformers and CNNs in a parallel style, where both global
dependency and low-level spatial details can be efficiently captured in a much
shallower manner. Besides, a novel fusion technique - BiFusion module is
created to efficiently fuse the multi-level features from both branches.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransFuse achieves the newest
state-of-the-art results on both 2D and 3D medical image sets including polyp,
skin lesion, hip, and prostate segmentation, with significant parameter

women's health prevention. The existing machines embedded in the AI system do
not reach the accuracy that clinicians hope. How to make intelligent systems
more reliable is a common problem. Methods: 1) Ultrasound image
super-resolution: the SRGAN super-resolution network reduces the unclearness of
ultrasound images caused by the device itself and improves the accuracy and
generalization of the detection model. 2) In response to the needs of medical
images, we have improved the YOLOv4 and the CenterNet models. 3) Multi-AI
model: based on the respective advantages of different AI models, we employ two
AI models to determine clinical resuls cross validation. And we accept the same
results and refuses others. Results: 1) With the help of the super-resolution
model, the YOLOv4 model and the CenterNet model both increased the mAP score by
9.6% and 13.8%. 2) Two methods for transforming the target model into a
classification model are proposed. And the unified output is in a specified
format to facilitate the call of the molti-AI model. 3) In the classification
evaluation experiment, concatenated by the YOLOv4 model (sensitivity 57.73%,
specificity 90.08%) and the CenterNet model (sensitivity 62.64%, specificity
92.54%), the multi-AI model will refuse to make judgments on 23.55% of the
input data. Correspondingly, the performance has been greatly improved to
95.91% for the sensitivity and 96.02% for the specificity. Conclusion: Our work
makes the AI model more reliable in medical image diagnosis. Significance: 1)
The proposed method makes the target detection model more suitable for
diagnosing breast ultrasound images. 2) It provides a new idea for artificial
intelligence in medical diagnosis, which can more conveniently introduce target

utilize complementary information from multiple views. However, there are few
methods to consider the negative impact caused by certain views with unclear
clustering structures, resulting in poor multi-view clustering performance. To
address this drawback, we propose self-supervised discriminative feature
learning for deep multi-view clustering (SDMVC). Concretely, deep autoencoders
are applied to learn embedded features for each view independently. To leverage
the multi-view complementary information, we concatenate all views' embedded
features to form the global features, which can overcome the negative impact of
some views' unclear clustering structures. In a self-supervised manner,
pseudo-labels are obtained to build a unified target distribution to perform
multi-view discriminative feature learning. During this process, global
discriminative information can be mined to supervise all views to learn more
discriminative features, which in turn are used to update the target
distribution. Besides, this unified target distribution can make SDMVC learn
consistent cluster assignments, which accomplishes the clustering consistency
of multiple views while preserving their features' diversity. Experiments on
various types of multi-view datasets show that SDMVC achieves state-of-the-art
performance.]]></summary>

usually requires a large amount of labeled data. However, obtaining reliable
annotations is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised learning has
attracted much attention in medical image segmentation by taking the advantage
of unlabeled data which is much easier to acquire. In this paper, we propose a
novel dual-task mutual learning framework for semi-supervised medical image
segmentation. Our framework can be formulated as an integration of two
individual segmentation networks based on two tasks: learning region-based
shape constraint and learning boundary-based surface mismatch. Different from
the one-way transfer between teacher and student networks, an ensemble of
dual-task students can learn collaboratively and implicitly explore useful
knowledge from each other during the training process. By jointly learning the
segmentation probability maps and signed distance maps of targets, our
framework can enforce the geometric shape constraint and learn more reliable
information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
performance gains by leveraging unlabeled data and outperforms the
state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation methods.]]></summary>

one non-differentiable component in the pipeline, Non-Maximum Suppression
(NMS), and building up an end-to-end system. However, what makes for its
one-to-one prediction has not been well understood. In this paper, we first
point out that one-to-one positive sample assignment is the key factor, while,
one-to-many assignment in previous detectors causes redundant predictions in
inference. Second, we surprisingly find that even training with one-to-one
assignment, previous detectors still produce redundant predictions. We identify
that classification cost in matching cost is the main ingredient: (1) previous
detectors only consider location cost, (2) by additionally introducing
classification cost, previous detectors immediately produce one-to-one
prediction during inference. We introduce the concept of score gap to explore
the effect of matching cost. Classification cost enlarges the score gap by
choosing positive samples as those of highest score in the training iteration
and reducing noisy positive samples brought by only location cost. Finally, we
demonstrate the advantages of end-to-end object detection on crowded scenes.

cancer liver metastases (CRLM) is the major cause of death in patients with
colorectal cancer. Multifocality occurs frequently in CRLM, but is relatively
unexplored in CRLM outcome prediction. Most existing clinical and imaging
biomarkers do not take the imaging features of all multifocal lesions into
account. In this paper, we present an end-to-end autoencoder-based multiple
instance neural network (AMINN) for the prediction of survival outcomes in
multifocal CRLM patients using radiomic features extracted from
contrast-enhanced MRIs. Specifically, we jointly train an autoencoder to
reconstruct input features and a multiple instance network to make predictions
by aggregating information from all tumour lesions of a patient. Also, we
incorporate a two-step normalization technique to improve the training of deep
neural networks, built on the observation that the distributions of radiomic
features are almost always severely skewed. Experimental results empirically
validated our hypothesis that incorporating imaging features of all lesions
improves outcome prediction for multifocal cancer. The proposed AMINN framework
achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.70, which is 11.4% higher than
the best baseline method. A risk score based on the outputs of AMINN achieved
superior prediction in our multifocal CRLM cohort. The effectiveness of
incorporating all lesions and applying two-step normalization is demonstrated
by a series of ablation studies. A Keras implementation of AMINN is released.]]></summary>

given target, which is a challenging problem due to factors such as deformation
and occlusion. Many recent trackers adopt the multiple-stage tracking strategy
to improve the quality of bounding box estimation. These methods first coarsely
locate the target and then refine the initial prediction in the following
stages. However, existing approaches still suffer from limited precision, and
the coupling of different stages severely restricts the method's
transferability. This work proposes a novel, flexible, and accurate refinement
module called Alpha-Refine (AR), which can significantly improve the base
trackers' box estimation quality. By exploring a series of design options, we
conclude that the key to successful refinement is extracting and maintaining
detailed spatial information as much as possible. Following this principle,
Alpha-Refine adopts a pixel-wise correlation, a corner prediction head, and an
auxiliary mask head as the core components. Comprehensive experiments on
TrackingNet, LaSOT, GOT-10K, and VOT2020 benchmarks with multiple base trackers
show that our approach significantly improves the base trackers' performance
with little extra latency. The proposed Alpha-Refine method leads to a series
of strengthened trackers, among which the ARSiamRPN (AR strengthened SiamRPNpp)
and the ARDiMP50 (ARstrengthened DiMP50) achieve good efficiency-precision
trade-off, while the ARDiMPsuper (AR strengthened DiMP-super) achieves very
competitive performance at a real-time speed. Code and pretrained models are

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, many plug-and-play self-attention modules are proposed to enhance
the model generalization by exploiting the internal information of deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Previous works lay an emphasis on the
design of attention module for specific functionality, e.g., light-weighted or
task-oriented attention. However, they ignore the importance of where to plug
in the attention module since they connect the modules individually with each
block of the entire CNN backbone for granted, leading to incremental
computational cost and number of parameters with the growth of network depth.
Thus, we propose a framework called Efficient Attention Network (EAN) to
improve the efficiency for the existing attention modules. In EAN, we leverage
the sharing mechanism (Huang et al. 2020) to share the attention module within
the backbone and search where to connect the shared attention module via
reinforcement learning. Finally, we obtain the attention network with sparse
connections between the backbone and modules, while (1) maintaining accuracy
(2) reducing extra parameter increment and (3) accelerating inference.
Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks and popular attention networks
show the effectiveness of EAN. Furthermore, we empirically illustrate that our
EAN has the capacity of transferring to other tasks and capturing the
informative features. The code is available at

play an important role in dimensionality reduction and deformation
compensation. However, their kernel shapes and pooling operations are
empirically predetermined; typically, a fixed-size square kernel shape and max
pooling operation are used. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning framework
for pooling layers. As part of our framework, a parameterized pooling layer is
proposed in which the kernel shape and pooling operation are trainable using
two parameters, thereby allowing flexible pooling of the input data. We also
propose a meta-learning algorithm for the parameterized pooling layer, which
allows us to acquire a suitable pooling layer across multiple tasks. In the
experiment, we applied the proposed meta-learning framework to character
recognition tasks. The results demonstrate that a pooling layer that is
suitable across character recognition tasks was obtained via meta-learning, and
the obtained pooling layer improved the performance of the model in both
few-shot character recognition and noisy image recognition tasks.]]></summary>

noninvasiveness. The number of chest X-ray images has skyrocketed, but reading
chest X-rays still have been manually performed by radiologists, which creates
huge burnouts and delays. Traditionally, radiomics, as a subfield of radiology
that can extract a large number of quantitative features from medical images,
demonstrates its potential to facilitate medical imaging diagnosis before the
deep learning era. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end framework,
ChexRadiNet, that can utilize the radiomics features to improve the abnormality
classification performance. Specifically, ChexRadiNet first applies a
light-weight but efficient triplet-attention mechanism to classify the chest
X-rays and highlight the abnormal regions. Then it uses the generated class
activation map to extract radiomic features, which further guides our model to
learn more robust image features. After a number of iterations and with the
help of radiomic features, our framework can converge to more accurate image
regions. We evaluate the ChexRadiNet framework using three public datasets: NIH
ChestX-ray, CheXpert, and MIMIC-CXR. We find that ChexRadiNet outperforms the
state-of-the-art on both disease detection (0.843 in AUC) and localization
(0.679 in T(IoU) = 0.1). We will make the code publicly available at
https://github.com/bionlplab/lung_disease_detection_amia2021, with the hope
that this method can facilitate the development of automatic systems with a
higher-level understanding of the radiological world.]]></summary>

remote sensing. Hyperspectral images typically generate large data cubes posing
big challenges in data acquisition, storage, transmission and processing. To
overcome these limitations, this paper develops a novel deep learning HIC
approach based on compressive measurements of coded-aperture snapshot spectral
imagers (CASSI), without reconstructing the complete hyperspectral data cube. A
new kind of deep learning strategy, namely 3D coded convolutional neural
network (3D-CCNN) is proposed to efficiently solve for the classification
problem, where the hardware-based coded aperture is regarded as a pixel-wise
connected network layer. An end-to-end training method is developed to jointly
optimize the network parameters and the coded apertures with periodic
structures. The accuracy of classification is effectively improved by
exploiting the synergy between the deep learning network and coded apertures.
The superiority of the proposed method is assessed over the state-of-the-art
HIC methods on several hyperspectral datasets.]]></summary>

labels has become a trend for person re-identification (re-ID) algorithms in
domain adaptation. A potential limitation of these clustering-based methods is
that they always tend to introduce noisy labels, which will undoubtedly hamper
the performance of our re-ID system. To handle this limitation, an intuitive
solution is to utilize collaborative training to purify the pseudo label
quality. However, there exists a challenge that the complementarity of two
networks, which inevitably share a high similarity, becomes weakened gradually
as training process goes on; worse still, these approaches typically ignore to
consider the self-discrepancy of intra-class relations. To address this issue,
in this paper, we propose a multiple co-teaching framework for domain adaptive
person re-ID, opening up a promising direction about self-discrepancy problem
under unsupervised condition. On top of that, a mean-teaching mechanism is
leveraged to enlarge the difference and discover more complementary features.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on several large-scale datasets show that
our method achieves competitive performance compared with the

video, which is a critical task in various applications, such as perception,

have demonstrated compelling results, most works estimate depth maps of
individual video frames independently, without taking into consideration the
strong geometric and temporal coherence among the frames. Moreover, current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models mostly adopt a fully 3D convolution network for
cost regularization and therefore require high computational cost, thus
limiting their deployment in real-world applications. Our method achieves
temporally coherent depth estimation results by using a novel Epipolar
Spatio-Temporal (EST) transformer to explicitly associate geometric and
temporal correlation with multiple estimated depth maps. Furthermore, to reduce
the computational cost, inspired by recent Mixture-of-Experts models, we design
a compact hybrid network consisting of a 2D context-aware network and a 3D

separately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves higher

While many methods for learning calibrated decoders have been proposed, many of

aerial images that are often distributed with large scale variations and
arbitrary orientations. However most of existing methods rely on heuristically
defined anchors with different scales, angles and aspect ratios and usually
suffer from severe misalignment between anchor boxes and axis-aligned
convolutional features, which leads to the common inconsistency between the
classification score and localization accuracy. To address this issue, we
propose a Single-shot Alignment Network (S$^2$A-Net) consisting of two modules:
a Feature Alignment Module (FAM) and an Oriented Detection Module (ODM). The
FAM can generate high-quality anchors with an Anchor Refinement Network and
adaptively align the convolutional features according to the anchor boxes with
a novel Alignment Convolution. The ODM first adopts active rotating filters to
encode the orientation information and then produces orientation-sensitive and
orientation-invariant features to alleviate the inconsistency between
classification score and localization accuracy. Besides, we further explore the
approach to detect objects in large-size images, which leads to a better
trade-off between speed and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two commonly used aerial

Core problems are what IGRs to use and how to learn them more effectively. We
answer the former question by designing IGRs based on an interpolated cuboid
that derives from primitive 3D annotation readily. The latter question
motivates us to incorporate geometry knowledge with a new loss function based
on a projective invariant. This loss function allows unlabeled data to be used
in the training stage to improve representation learning. Without additional

applications such as film production and augmented reality. However, the furry
characteristics and various appearance of the foregrounds, e.g., animal and
portrait, challenge existing matting methods, which usually require extra user
inputs such as trimap or scribbles. To resolve these problems, we study the
distinct roles of semantics and details for image matting and decompose the
task into two parallel sub-tasks: high-level semantic segmentation and
low-level details matting. Specifically, we propose a novel Glance and Focus
Matting network (GFM), which employs a shared encoder and two separate decoders
to learn both tasks in a collaborative manner for end-to-end natural image
matting. Besides, due to the limitation of available natural images in the
matting task, previous methods typically adopt composite images for training
and evaluation, which result in limited generalization ability on real-world
images. In this paper, we investigate the domain gap issue between composite
images and real-world images systematically by conducting comprehensive
analyses of various discrepancies between foreground and background images. We
find that a carefully designed composition route RSSN that aims to reduce the
discrepancies can lead to a better model with remarkable generalization
ability. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark containing 2,000 high-resolution
real-world animal images and 10,000 portrait images along with their manually
labeled alpha mattes to serve as a test bed for evaluating matting model's
generalization ability on real-world images. Comprehensive empirical studies
have demonstrated that GFM outperforms state-of-the-art methods and effectively
reduces the generalization error. The code and the dataset will be released.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capturing uncertainty in object detection is indispensable for safe
autonomous driving. In recent years, deep learning has become the de-facto
approach for object detection, and many probabilistic object detectors have
been proposed. However, there is no summary on uncertainty estimation in deep
object detection, and existing methods are not only built with different
network architectures and uncertainty estimation methods, but also evaluated on
different datasets with a wide range of evaluation metrics. As a result, a
comparison among methods remains challenging, as does the selection of a model
that best suits a particular application. This paper aims to alleviate this
problem by providing a review and comparative study on existing probabilistic
object detection methods for autonomous driving applications. First, we provide
an overview of generic uncertainty estimation in deep learning, and then
systematically survey existing methods and evaluation metrics for probabilistic
object detection. Next, we present a strict comparative study for probabilistic
object detection based on an image detector and three public autonomous driving
datasets. Finally, we present a discussion of the remaining challenges and
future works. Code has been made available at

image recognition tasks, and a lot of related studies have been conducted.
However, data augmentation on 3D point cloud data has not been much explored.
3D label has more sophisticated and rich structural information than the 2D
label, so it enables more diverse and effective data augmentation. In this
paper, we propose part-aware data augmentation (PA-AUG) that can better utilize
rich information of 3D label to enhance the performance of 3D object detectors.
PA-AUG divides objects into partitions and stochastically applies five
augmentation methods to each local region. It is compatible with existing point
cloud data augmentation methods and can be used universally regardless of the
detector's architecture. PA-AUG has improved the performance of
state-of-the-art 3D object detector for all classes of the KITTI dataset and
has the equivalent effect of increasing the train data by about 2.5$\times$. We
also show that PA-AUG not only increases performance for a given dataset but
also is robust to corrupted data. The code is available at

To compute the gradients required to update parameters, backpropagation blocks
computations until the forward and backward passes are completed. For temporal
signals, this introduces high latency and hinders real-time learning. It also
creates a coupling between consecutive layers, which limits model parallelism
and increases memory consumption. In this paper, we build upon Sideways, which
avoids blocking by propagating approximate gradients forward in time, and we
propose mechanisms for temporal integration of information based on different
variants of skip connections. We also show how to decouple computation and
delegate individual neural modules to different devices, allowing distributed
and parallel training. The proposed Skip-Sideways achieves low latency
training, model parallelism, and, importantly, is capable of extracting
temporal features, leading to more stable training and improved performance on
real-world action recognition video datasets such as HMDB51, UCF101, and the
large-scale Kinetics-600. Finally, we also show that models trained with
Skip-Sideways generate better future frames than Sideways models, and hence
they can better utilize motion cues.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vision transformer (ViT) models exhibit substandard optimizability. In
particular, they are sensitive to the choice of optimizer (AdamW vs. SGD),
optimizer hyperparameters, and training schedule length. In comparison, modern
convolutional neural networks are far easier to optimize. Why is this the case?
In this work, we conjecture that the issue lies with the patchify stem of ViT
models, which is implemented by a stride-p pxp convolution (p=16 by default)
applied to the input image. This large-kernel plus large-stride convolution
runs counter to typical design choices of convolutional layers in neural
networks. To test whether this atypical design choice causes an issue, we
analyze the optimization behavior of ViT models with their original patchify
stem versus a simple counterpart where we replace the ViT stem by a small
number of stacked stride-two 3x3 convolutions. While the vast majority of
computation in the two ViT designs is identical, we find that this small change
in early visual processing results in markedly different training behavior in
terms of the sensitivity to optimization settings as well as the final model
accuracy. Using a convolutional stem in ViT dramatically increases optimization
stability and also improves peak performance (by ~1-2% top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1k), while maintaining flops and runtime. The improvement can be
observed across the wide spectrum of model complexities (from 1G to 36G flops)
and dataset scales (from ImageNet-1k to ImageNet-21k). These findings lead us
to recommend using a standard, lightweight convolutional stem for ViT models as
a more robust architectural choice compared to the original ViT model design.]]></summary>

surpasses all baselines on 4 of them. We perform experiments on both the Wilds

accurate prediction using machine learning models, as such models often fail to

normalizing-flow-based method to perform counterfactual inference upon a
structural causal model (SCM), in order to achieve harmonization of such data.
A causal model is used to model observed effects (brain magnetic resonance
imaging data) that result from known confounders (site, gender and age) and
exogenous noise variables. Our formulation exploits the bijection induced by
flow for the purpose of harmonization. We infer the posterior of exogenous
variables, intervene on observations, and draw samples from the resultant SCM
to obtain counterfactuals. This approach is evaluated extensively on multiple,
large, real-world medical datasets and displayed better cross-domain
generalization compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Further experiments
that evaluate the quality of confounder-independent data generated by our model

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neuromorphic vision sensors (NVS) have been recently explored to tackle
scenarios where conventional sensors result in high data rate and processing
time. This paper presents a hybrid event-frame approach for detecting and
tracking objects recorded by a stationary neuromorphic sensor, thereby
exploiting the sparse NVS output in a low-power setting for traffic monitoring.
Specifically, we propose a hardware efficient processing pipeline that
optimizes memory and computational needs. The usage of NVS gives the advantage
of rejecting background while it has a unique disadvantage of fragmented
objects. To exploit the background removal, we propose an event-based binary
image creation that signals presence or absence of events in a frame duration.
This reduces memory requirement and enables usage of simple algorithms like
median filtering and connected component labeling for denoise and region
proposal respectively. To overcome the fragmentation issue, a YOLO-inspired
neural network based detector and classifier to merge fragmented region
proposals has been proposed. Finally, an overlap based tracker exploiting
overlap between detections and tracks is proposed with heuristics to overcome
occlusion. The proposed pipeline is evaluated with more than 5 hours of traffic
recording spanning three different locations on two different NVS and
demonstrate similar performance. Compared to existing event-based feature
trackers, our method provides similar accuracy while needing 6 times less
computes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a stationary NVS
based traffic monitoring solution is extensively compared to simultaneously
recorded RGB frame-methods while showing tremendous promise by outperforming
state-of-the-art deep learning solutions.]]></summary>

a color video, which is a fundamental problem in scene understanding, robot
navigation or handheld 3D reconstruction. While recent learning-based methods
estimate depth at high accuracy, 3D point clouds exported from their depth maps
often fail to preserve important geometric feature (e.g., corners, edges,
planes) of man-made scenes. Widely-used pixel-wise depth errors do not
specifically penalize inconsistency on these features. These inaccuracies are
particularly severe when subsequent depth reconstructions are accumulated in an
attempt to scan a full environment with man-made objects with this kind of
features. Our depth estimation algorithm therefore introduces a Combined Normal
Map (CNM) constraint, which is designed to better preserve high-curvature
features and global planar regions. In order to further improve the depth
estimation accuracy, we introduce a new occlusion-aware strategy that
aggregates initial depth predictions from multiple adjacent views into one
final depth map and one occlusion probability map for the current reference

political discussion and decision-making for many years. Shallow clouds play a
significant role in understanding the Earth's climate, but they are challenging
to interpret and represent in a climate model. By classifying these cloud
structures, there is a better possibility of understanding the physical
structures of the clouds, which would improve the climate model generation,
resulting in a better prediction of climate change or forecasting weather
update. Clouds organise in many forms, which makes it challenging to build
traditional rule-based algorithms to separate cloud features. In this paper,
classification of cloud organization patterns was performed using a new
scaled-up version of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) named as EfficientNet
as the encoder and UNet as decoder where they worked as feature extractor and
reconstructor of fine grained feature map and was used as a classifier, which
will help experts to understand how clouds will shape the future climate. By
using a segmentation model in a classification task, it was shown that with a
good encoder alongside UNet, it is possible to obtain good performance from
this dataset. Dice coefficient has been used for the final evaluation metric,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When an agent encounters a continual stream of new tasks in the lifelong
learning setting, it leverages the knowledge it gained from the earlier tasks
to help learn the new tasks better. In such a scenario, identifying an
efficient knowledge representation becomes a challenging problem. Most research
works propose to either store a subset of examples from the past tasks in a
replay buffer, dedicate a separate set of parameters to each task or penalize
excessive updates over parameters by introducing a regularization term. While
existing methods employ the general task-agnostic stochastic gradient descent
update rule, we propose a task-aware optimizer that adapts the learning rate
based on the relatedness among tasks. We utilize the directions taken by the
parameters during the updates by accumulating the gradients specific to each
task. These task-based accumulated gradients act as a knowledge base that is
maintained and updated throughout the stream. We empirically show that our
proposed adaptive learning rate not only accounts for catastrophic forgetting
but also allows positive backward transfer. We also show that our method
performs better than several state-of-the-art methods in lifelong learning on
complex datasets with a large number of tasks.]]></summary>

higher computation complexity. The widely-used convolutions in deep neural
networks are exactly cross-correlation to measure the similarity between input
feature and convolution filters, which involves massive multiplications between
float values. In this paper, we present adder networks (AdderNets) to trade
these massive multiplications in deep neural networks, especially convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), for much cheaper additions to reduce computation costs.
In AdderNets, we take the $\ell_1$-norm distance between filters and input
feature as the output response. The influence of this new similarity measure on
the optimization of neural network have been thoroughly analyzed. To achieve a
better performance, we develop a special back-propagation approach for
AdderNets by investigating the full-precision gradient. We then propose an
adaptive learning rate strategy to enhance the training procedure of AdderNets
according to the magnitude of each neuron's gradient. As a result, the proposed
AdderNets can achieve 74.9% Top-1 accuracy 91.7% Top-5 accuracy using ResNet-50
on the ImageNet dataset without any multiplication in convolution layer. The

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Traditional computer vision approaches, based on neural networks (NN), are
typically trained on a large amount of image data. By minimizing the
cross-entropy loss between a prediction and a given class label, the NN and its
visual embedding space are learned to fulfill a given task. However, due to the
sole dependence on the image data distribution of the training domain, these
models tend to fail when applied to a target domain that differs from their
source domain. To learn a more robust NN to domain shifts, we propose the
knowledge graph neural network (KG-NN), a neuro-symbolic approach that
supervises the training using image-data-invariant auxiliary knowledge. The
auxiliary knowledge is first encoded in a knowledge graph with respective
concepts and their relationships, which is then transformed into a dense vector
representation via an embedding method. Using a contrastive loss function,
KG-NN learns to adapt its visual embedding space and thus its weights according
to the image-data invariant knowledge graph embedding space. We evaluate KG-NN
on visual transfer learning tasks for classification using the mini-ImageNet
dataset and its derivatives, as well as road sign recognition datasets from
Germany and China. The results show that a visual model trained with a
knowledge graph as a trainer outperforms a model trained with cross-entropy in
all experiments, in particular when the domain gap increases. Besides better
performance and stronger robustness to domain shifts, these KG-NN adapts to
multiple datasets and classes without suffering heavily from catastrophic
forgetting.]]></summary>

only optimize the overall reward but also satisfy the additional safety,
diversity, or budget constraints. Consequently, existing constrained RL
solutions require several new algorithmic ingredients that are notably
different from standard RL. On the other hand, reward-free RL is independently
developed in the unconstrained literature, which learns the transition dynamics
without using the reward information, and thus naturally capable of addressing
RL with multiple objectives under the common dynamics. This paper bridges
reward-free RL and constrained RL. Particularly, we propose a simple
meta-algorithm such that given any reward-free RL oracle, the approachability
and constrained RL problems can be directly solved with negligible overheads in
sample complexity. Utilizing the existing reward-free RL solvers, our framework
provides sharp sample complexity results for constrained RL in the tabular MDP
setting, matching the best existing results up to a factor of horizon
dependence; our framework directly extends to a setting of tabular two-player
Markov games, and gives a new result for constrained RL with linear function
approximation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Differential privacy (DP) is a widely-accepted and widely-applied notion of
privacy based on worst-case analysis. Often, DP classifies most mechanisms
without external noise as non-private [Dwork et al., 2014], and external
noises, such as Gaussian noise or Laplacian noise [Dwork et al., 2006], are
introduced to improve privacy. In many real-world applications, however, adding
external noise is undesirable and sometimes prohibited. For example,
presidential elections often require a deterministic rule to be used [Liu et
al., 2020], and small noises can lead to dramatic decreases in the prediction
accuracy of deep neural networks, especially the underrepresented classes
[Bagdasaryan et al., 2019].

In this paper, we propose a natural extension and relaxation of DP following
the worst average-case idea behind the celebrated smoothed analysis [Spielman
and Teng, 2004]. Our notion, the smoothed DP, can effectively measure the
privacy leakage of mechanisms without external noises under realistic settings.

We prove several strong properties of the smoothed DP, including
composability, robustness to post-processing and etc. We proved that any
discrete mechanism with sampling procedures is more private than what DP
predicts. In comparison, many continuous mechanisms with sampling procedures
are still non-private under smoothed DP. Experimentally, we first verified that
the discrete sampling mechanisms are private in real-world elections. Then, we
apply the smoothed DP notion on quantized gradient descent, which indicates
some neural networks can be private without adding any extra noises. We believe
that these results contribute to the theoretical foundation of realistic
privacy measures beyond worst-case analysis.]]></summary>

that gaining robustness means losing accuracy. It is also generally believed
that, unless making networks larger, network architectural elements would
otherwise matter little in improving adversarial robustness. Here we present
evidence to challenge these common beliefs by a careful study about adversarial
training. Our key observation is that the widely-used ReLU activation function
significantly weakens adversarial training due to its non-smooth nature. Hence
we propose smooth adversarial training (SAT), in which we replace ReLU with its
smooth approximations to strengthen adversarial training. The purpose of smooth
activation functions in SAT is to allow it to find harder adversarial examples
and compute better gradient updates during adversarial training.

Compared to standard adversarial training, SAT improves adversarial
robustness for "free", i.e., no drop in accuracy and no increase in
computational cost. For example, without introducing additional computations,
SAT significantly enhances ResNet-50's robustness from 33.0% to 42.3%, while
also improving accuracy by 0.9% on ImageNet. SAT also works well with larger
networks: it helps EfficientNet-L1 to achieve 82.2% accuracy and 58.6%
robustness on ImageNet, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art defense by
9.5% for accuracy and 11.6% for robustness. Models are available at

crisis with high mortality, and morbidity. Currently, when sepsis is detected
and the underlying pathogen is identified, organ damage may have already
progressed to irreversible stages. Effective sepsis management is therefore
highly time-sensitive. By systematically analysing trends in the plethora of
clinical data available in the intensive care unit (ICU), an early prediction
of sepsis could lead to earlier pathogen identification, resistance testing,
and effective antibiotic and supportive treatment, and thereby become a
life-saving measure. Here, we developed and validated a machine learning (ML)
system for the prediction of sepsis in the ICU. Our analysis represents the
largest multi-national, multi-centre in-ICU study for sepsis prediction using
ML to date. Our dataset contains $156,309$ unique ICU admissions, which
represent a refined and harmonised subset of five large ICU databases
originating from three countries. Using the international consensus definition
Sepsis-3, we derived hourly-resolved sepsis label annotations, amounting to
$26,734$ ($17.1\%$) septic stays. We compared our approach, a deep
self-attention model, to several clinical baselines as well as ML baselines and
performed an extensive internal and external validation within and across
databases. On average, our model was able to predict sepsis with an AUROC of
$0.847 \pm 0.050$ (internal out-of sample validation) and $0.761 \pm 0.052$

video, avoiding unpleasant blur effect caused by interpolation-based
algorithms. However, vast computation complexity and memory occupation hampers
the edge of deplorability and the runtime inference in real-life applications,
especially for large-scale VSR task. This paper explores the possibility of
real-time VSR system and designs an efficient and generic VSR network, termed
EGVSR. The proposed EGVSR is based on spatio-temporal adversarial learning for
temporal coherence. In order to pursue faster VSR processing ability up to 4K
resolution, this paper tries to choose lightweight network structure and
efficient upsampling method to reduce the computation required by EGVSR network
under the guarantee of high visual quality. Besides, we implement the batch
normalization computation fusion, convolutional acceleration algorithm and
other neural network acceleration techniques on the actual hardware platform to
optimize the inference process of EGVSR network. Finally, our EGVSR achieves
the real-time processing capacity of 4K@29.61FPS. Compared with TecoGAN, the

moving agents around the ego-vehicle need to be accurately detected for safe
trajectory planning. It also enables appearance agnostic detection of objects
based on motion cues. There are geometric challenges like motion-parallax
ambiguity which makes it a difficult problem. In this work, we aim to leverage
the vehicle motion information and feed it into the model to have an adaptation
mechanism based on ego-motion. The motivation is to enable the model to
implicitly perform ego-motion compensation to improve performance. We convert
the six degrees of freedom vehicle motion into a pixel-wise tensor which can be
fed as input to the CNN model. The proposed model using Vehicle Motion Tensor
(VMT) achieves an absolute improvement of 5.6% in mIoU over the baseline
architecture. We also achieve state-of-the-art results on the public

Convolutional Neural Networks (G-CNNs). In this framework, a network layer is
seen as a set of PDE-solvers where geometrically meaningful PDE-coefficients
become the layer's trainable weights. Formulating our PDEs on homogeneous
spaces allows these networks to be designed with built-in symmetries such as
rotation in addition to the standard translation equivariance of CNNs.

Having all the desired symmetries included in the design obviates the need to
include them by means of costly techniques such as data augmentation. We will
discuss our PDE-based G-CNNs (PDE-G-CNNs) in a general homogeneous space
setting while also going into the specifics of our primary case of interest:
roto-translation equivariance.

We solve the PDE of interest by a combination of linear group convolutions
and non-linear morphological group convolutions with analytic kernel
approximations that we underpin with formal theorems. Our kernel approximations
allow for fast GPU-implementation of the PDE-solvers, we release our
implementation with this article. Just like for linear convolution a
morphological convolution is specified by a kernel that we train in our
PDE-G-CNNs. In PDE-G-CNNs we do not use non-linearities such as max/min-pooling
and ReLUs as they are already subsumed by morphological convolutions.

We present a set of experiments to demonstrate the strength of the proposed
PDE-G-CNNs in increasing the performance of deep learning based imaging
applications with far fewer parameters than traditional CNNs.]]></summary>

DeepRelativeFusion, that is capable to recover a globally consistent 3D

depth prediction to densify the semi-dense depth maps and refine the keyframe

filtering scheme, which is a structure-preserving weighted average smoothing
filter that takes into account the pixel intensity and depth of the
neighbouring pixels, yielding substantial reconstruction accuracy gain in
densification. To perform densification, we introduce two incremental
improvements upon the energy minimization framework proposed by DeepFusion: (1)
an improved cost function, and (2) the use of single-image relative depth
prediction. After densification, we update the keyframes with two-view
consistent optimized semi-dense and dense depth maps to improve pose-graph

structure of a table, which is a key step to make machines understand tables.
However, tabular data in unstructured digital documents, e.g. Portable Document
Format (PDF) and images, are difficult to parse into structured
machine-readable format, due to complexity and diversity in their structure and
style, especially for complex tables. In this paper, we introduce Split, Embed
and Merge (SEM), an accurate table structure recognizer. In the first stage, we
use the FCN to predict the potential regions of the table row (column)
separators, so as to obtain the bounding boxes of the basic grids in the table.
In the second stage, we not only extract the visual features corresponding to
each grid through RoIAlign, but also use the off-the-shelf recognizer and the
BERT to extract the semantic features. The fused features of both are used to
characterize each table grid. We find that by adding additional semantic
features to each grid, the ambiguity problem of the table structure from the
visual perspective can be solved to a certain extent and achieve higher
precision. Finally, we process the merging of these basic grids in a
self-regression manner. The correspondent merging results is learned by the
attention maps in attention mechanism. With the proposed method, we can
recognize the structure of tables well, even for complex tables. SEM can
achieve an average F-Measure of $96.9\%$ on the SciTSR dataset which
outperforms other methods by a large margin. Extensive experiments on other
publicly available table structure recognition datasets show that our model
achieves state-of-the-art.]]></summary>

vision applications brought fresh air to the research and industrial community.
This success is mainly due to the process that allows those methods to learn
data-driven features, generally based upon linear operations. However, in some
scenarios, such operations do not have a good performance because of their
inherited process that blurs edges, losing notions of corners, borders, and
geometry of objects. Overcoming this, non-linear operations, such as
morphological ones, may preserve such properties of the objects, being
preferable and even state-of-the-art in some applications. Encouraged by this,
in this work, we propose a novel network, called Deep Morphological Network
(DeepMorphNet), capable of doing non-linear morphological operations while
performing the feature learning process by optimizing the structuring elements.
The DeepMorphNets can be trained and optimized end-to-end using traditional
existing techniques commonly employed in the training of deep learning
approaches. A systematic evaluation of the proposed algorithm is conducted
using two synthetic and two traditional image classification datasets. Results
show that the proposed DeepMorphNets is a promising technique that can learn
distinct features when compared to the ones learned by current deep learning

Clip-level instance tracks generated densely for each frame in the sequence are
finally aggregated to produce video-level object instance segmentation and

autonomous driving vehicles. Tracking all dynamic objects around the vehicle is
essential for tasks such as obstacle avoidance and path planning. Autonomous
vehicles are usually equipped with different sensor modalities to improve
accuracy and reliability. While sensor fusion has been widely used in object
detection networks in recent years, most existing multi-object tracking
algorithms either rely on a single input modality, or do not fully exploit the
information provided by multiple sensing modalities. In this work, we propose
an end-to-end network for joint object detection and tracking based on radar
and camera sensor fusion. Our proposed method uses a center-based radar-camera
fusion algorithm for object detection and utilizes a greedy algorithm for
object association. The proposed greedy algorithm uses the depth, velocity and
2D displacement of the detected objects to associate them through time. This
makes our tracking algorithm very robust to occluded and overlapping objects,
as the depth and velocity information can help the network in distinguishing
them. We evaluate our method on the challenging nuScenes dataset, where it
achieves 20.0 AMOTA and outperforms all vision-based 3D tracking methods in the
benchmark, as well as the baseline LiDAR-based method. Our method is online
with a runtime of 35ms per image, making it very suitable for autonomous
driving applications.]]></summary>

such as microcalcifications and masses, as well as morphologic features of
masses in sonographic scans, are the main diagnostic targets for tumor
detection. However, improved specificity of these imaging modalities is
required. A leading alternative target is neoangiogenesis. When pathological,
it contributes to the development of numerous types of tumors, and the
formation of metastases. Hence, demonstrating neoangiogenesis by visualization
of the microvasculature may be of great importance. Super resolution ultrasound
localization microscopy enables imaging of the microvasculature at the
capillary level. Yet, challenges such as long reconstruction time, dependency
on prior knowledge of the system Point Spread Function (PSF), and separability
of the Ultrasound Contrast Agents (UCAs), need to be addressed for translation
of super-resolution US into the clinic. In this work we use a deep neural
network architecture that makes effective use of signal structure to address
these challenges. We present in vivo human results of three different breast
lesions acquired with a clinical US scanner. By leveraging our trained network,
the microvasculature structure is recovered in a short time, without prior PSF
knowledge, and without requiring separability of the UCAs. Each of the
recoveries exhibits a different structure that corresponds with the known
histological structure. This study demonstrates the feasibility of in vivo
human super resolution, based on a clinical scanner, to increase US specificity
for different breast lesions and promotes the use of US in the diagnosis of
breast pathologies.]]></summary>

Knowledge-driven Representation learning method for remote sensing images

each remote sensing image are regarded as geographical knowledge to provide
supervision for representation learning and network pre-training. An efficient
pre-training framework is proposed to eliminate the supervision noises caused
by imaging times and resolutions difference between remote sensing images and
geographical knowledge. A large scale pre-training dataset Levir-KR is proposed
to support network pre-training. It contains 1,431,950 remote sensing images
from Gaofen series satellites with various resolutions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms ImageNet pre-training and
self-supervised representation learning methods and significantly reduces the

regular lattices to the more general setting of graphs and networks is very
important and much research has been done recently. The Generalized Haar-Walsh
Transform (GHWT) developed by Irion and Saito (2014) is a multiscale transform
for signals on graphs, which is a generalization of the classical Haar and
Walsh-Hadamard Transforms. We propose the extended Generalized Haar-Walsh
Transform (eGHWT), which is a generalization of the adapted time-frequency
tilings of Thiele and Villemoes (1996). The eGHWT examines not only the
efficiency of graph-domain partitions but also that of "sequency-domain"
partitions simultaneously. Consequently, the eGHWT and its associated
best-basis selection algorithm for graph signals significantly improve the
performance of the previous GHWT with the similar computational cost, $O(N \log
N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes of an input graph. While the GHWT
best-basis algorithm seeks the most suitable orthonormal basis for a given task
among more than $(1.5)^N$ possible orthonormal bases in $\mathbb{R}^N$, the
eGHWT best-basis algorithm can find a better one by searching through more than
$0.618\cdot(1.84)^N$ possible orthonormal bases in $\mathbb{R}^N$. This article
describes the details of the eGHWT best-basis algorithm and demonstrates its
superiority using several examples including genuine graph signals as well as
conventional digital images viewed as graph signals. Furthermore, we also show
how the eGHWT can be extended to 2D signals and matrix-form data by viewing
them as a tensor product of graphs generated from their columns and rows and
demonstrate its effectiveness on applications such as image approximation.]]></summary>

networks via deterministic training. Alternatively, very recent works utilize
deep reinforcement learning for restoring images with diverse or unknown
corruptions. Though deep reinforcement learning can generate effective policy
networks for operator selection or architecture search in image restoration,
how it is connected to the classic deterministic training in solving inverse
problems remains unclear. In this work, we propose a novel image denoising
scheme via Residual Recovery using Reinforcement Learning, dubbed R3L. We show
that R3L is equivalent to a deep recurrent neural network that is trained using
a stochastic reward, in contrast to many popular denoisers using supervised
learning with deterministic losses. To benchmark the effectiveness of
reinforcement learning in R3L, we train a recurrent neural network with the
same architecture for residual recovery using the deterministic loss, thus to
analyze how the two different training strategies affect the denoising
performance. With such a unified benchmarking system, we demonstrate that the
proposed R3L has better generalizability and robustness in image denoising when
the estimated noise level varies, comparing to its counterparts using
deterministic training, as well as various state-of-the-art image denoising
algorithms.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early action recognition (action prediction) from limited preliminary
observations plays a critical role for streaming vision systems that demand
real-time inference, as video actions often possess elongated temporal spans
which cause undesired latency. In this study, we address action prediction by
investigating how action patterns evolve over time in a spatial feature space.
There are three key components to our system. First, we work with
intermediate-layer ConvNet features, which allow for abstraction from raw data,
while retaining spatial layout. Second, instead of propagating features per se,
we propagate their residuals across time, which allows for a compact
representation that reduces redundancy. Third, we employ a Kalman filter to
combat error build-up and unify across prediction start times. Extensive
experimental results on multiple benchmarks show that our approach leads to
competitive performance in action prediction. Notably, we investigate the
learned components of our system to shed light on their otherwise opaque
natures in two ways. First, we document that our learned feature propagation
module works as a spatial shifting mechanism under convolution to propagate
current observations into the future. Thus, it captures flow-based image motion
information. Second, the learned Kalman filter adaptively updates prior
estimation to aid the sequence learning process.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the development of deep encoder-decoder architectures and large-scale
annotated medical datasets, great progress has been achieved in the development
of automatic medical image segmentation. Due to the stacking of convolution
layers and the consecutive sampling operations, existing standard models
inevitably encounter the information recession problem of feature
representations, which fails to fully model the global contextual feature
dependencies. To overcome the above challenges, this paper proposes a novel
Transformer based medical image semantic segmentation framework called
TransAttUnet, in which the multi-level guided attention and multi-scale skip
connection are jointly designed to effectively enhance the functionality and
flexibility of traditional U-shaped architecture. Inspired by Transformer, a
novel self-aware attention (SAA) module with both Transformer Self Attention
(TSA) and Global Spatial Attention (GSA) is incorporated into TransAttUnet to
effectively learn the non-local interactions between encoder features. In
particular, we also establish additional multi-scale skip connections between
decoder blocks to aggregate the different semantic-scale upsampling features.
In this way, the representation ability of multi-scale context information is
strengthened to generate discriminative features. Benefitting from these
complementary components, the proposed TransAttUnet can effectively alleviate
the loss of fine details caused by the information recession problem, improving
the diagnostic sensitivity and segmentation quality of medical image analysis.
Extensive experiments on multiple medical image segmentation datasets of
different imaging demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines.]]></summary>

over the years, many of them still fail at preserving the fine details of the
image after denoising. This is as a result of the smooth-out effect they have
on the images. Most neural network-based algorithms have achieved better
quantitative performance than the classical denoising algorithms. However, they
also suffer from qualitative (visual) performance as a result of the smooth-out

propose a deep collaborative filtering-based (Deep-CoFiB) algorithm for image
denoising. This algorithm performs collaborative denoising of image patches in
the sparse domain using a set of optimized neural network models. This results
in a fast algorithm that is able to excellently obtain a trade-off between
noise removal and details preservation. Extensive experiments show that the
DeepCoFiB performed quantitatively (in terms of PSNR and SSIM) and
qualitatively (visually) better than many of the state-of-the-art denoising

concerned with the anticipation of the unobserved future from the current as
well as historical video observations. Action prediction is a major sub-area of
video predictive understanding and is the focus of this review. This sub-area
has two major subdivisions: early action recognition and future action
prediction. Early action recognition is concerned with recognizing an ongoing
action as soon as possible. Future action prediction is concerned with the
anticipation of actions that follow those previously observed. In either case,
the \textbf{\textit{causal}} relationship between the past, current, and
potential future information is the main focus. Various mathematical tools such
as Markov Chains, Gaussian Processes, Auto-Regressive modeling, and Bayesian
recursive filtering are widely adopted jointly with computer vision techniques
for these two tasks. However, these approaches face challenges such as the
curse of dimensionality, poor generalization, and constraints from
domain-specific knowledge. Recently, structures that rely on deep convolutional
neural networks and recurrent neural networks have been extensively proposed
for improving the performance of existing vision tasks, in general, and action
prediction tasks, in particular. However, they have their own shortcomings, \eg
reliance on massive training data and lack of strong theoretical underpinnings.
In this survey, we start by introducing the major sub-areas of the broad area
of video predictive understanding, which recently have received intensive
attention and proven to have practical value. Next, a thorough review of
various early action recognition and future action prediction algorithms are
provided with suitably organized divisions. Finally, we conclude our discussion
with future research directions.]]></summary>

stratification of patients. Automated segmentation methods can help to assess
risk areas more accurately, and assist in therapeutic procedures or even
removal. In clinical practice, addition to the conventional white-light imaging
(WLI), complimentary modalities such as narrow-band imaging (NBI) and
fluorescence imaging are used. While, today most segmentation approaches are
supervised and only concentrated on a single modality dataset, this work
exploits to use a target-independent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)
technique that is capable to generalize to an unseen target modality. In this
context, we propose a novel UDA-based segmentation method that couples the
variational autoencoder and U-Net with a common EfficientNet-B4 backbone, and
uses a joint loss for latent-space optimization for target samples. We show
that our model can generalize to unseen target NBI (target) modality when
trained using only WLI (source) modality. Our experiments on both upper and
lower GI endoscopy data show the effectiveness of our approach compared to

for concept recognition. Secondly, a two-phase episode training strategy,
especially the transductive phase, is adopted to utilize unlabeled test
examples to alleviate the low-resource learning problem. Experiments on two
widely-used zero-shot compositional learning (ZSCL) benchmarks have
demonstrated the effectiveness of the model compared with recent approaches on
both conventional and generalized ZSCL settings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Existing Multi-Plane Image (MPI) based view-synthesis methods generate an MPI
aligned with the input view using a fixed number of planes in one forward pass.
These methods produce fast, high-quality rendering of novel views, but rely on
slow and computationally expensive MPI generation methods unsuitable for
real-time applications. In addition, most MPI techniques use fixed
depth/disparity planes which cannot be modified once the training is complete,
hence offering very little flexibility at run-time.

We propose LiveView - a novel MPI generation and rendering technique that
produces high-quality view synthesis in real-time. Our method can also offer
the flexibility to select scene-dependent MPI planes (number of planes and
spacing between them) at run-time. LiveView first warps input images to target
view (target-centered) and then learns to generate a target view centered MPI,
one depth plane at a time (dynamically). The method generates high-quality
renderings, while also enabling fast MPI generation and novel view synthesis.
As a result, LiveView enables real-time view synthesis applications where an
MPI needs to be updated frequently based on a video stream of input views. We
demonstrate that LiveView improves the quality of view synthesis while being 70
times faster at run-time compared to state-of-the-art MPI-based methods.]]></summary>

computed tomography (CT) reduces lung cancer mortality by 20% compared to
traditional chest radiography. Therefore, CT lung screening has started to be
used widely all across the world. However, analyzing these images is a serious
burden for radiologists. The number of slices in a CT scan can be up to 600.
Therefore, computer-aided-detection (CAD) systems are very important for faster
and more accurate assessment of the data. In this study, we proposed a
framework that analyzes CT lung screenings using convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) to reduce false positives. We trained our model with different volume
sizes and showed that volume size plays a critical role in the performance of
the system. We also used different fusions in order to show their power and
effect on the overall accuracy. 3D CNNs were preferred over 2D CNNs because 2D
convolutional operations applied to 3D data could result in information loss.
The proposed framework has been tested on the dataset provided by the LUNA16

fetal size according to standardized charts. To achieve a reproducible and
accurate measurement, a sonographer needs to identify three standard 2D planes
of the fetal anatomy (head, abdomen, femur) and manually mark the key
anatomical landmarks on the image for accurate biometry and fetal weight
estimation. This can be a time-consuming operator-dependent task, especially
for a trainee sonographer. Computer-assisted techniques can help in automating
the fetal biometry computation process. In this paper, we present a unified
automated framework for estimating all measurements needed for the fetal weight
assessment. The proposed framework semantically segments the key fetal
anatomies using state-of-the-art segmentation models, followed by region
fitting and scale recovery for the biometry estimation. We present an ablation
study of segmentation algorithms to show their robustness through 4-fold
cross-validation on a dataset of 349 ultrasound standard plane images from 42
pregnancies. Moreover, we show that the network with the best segmentation
performance tends to be more accurate for biometry estimation. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the error between clinically measured and predicted fetal
biometry is lower than the permissible error during routine clinical
measurements.]]></summary>

uneven contour of the object is more likely to appear, resulting in low-quality
prediction. Accordingly, we propose enhancement features and corresponding loss
functions for the silhouette of objects and backgrounds to improve the mask.
Meanwhile, we use the new proposed confidence score to solve the occlusion

functionality and is receiving increasing attention during the COVID-19
pandemic. Clinical findings show that it is possible for COVID-19 patients to
have significantly low SpO$_2$ before any obvious symptoms. The prevalence of
cameras has motivated researchers to investigate methods for monitoring SpO$_2$
using videos. Most prior schemes involving smartphones are contact-based: They
require a fingertip to cover the phone's camera and the nearby light source to
capture re-emitted light from the illuminated tissue. In this paper, we propose
the first convolutional neural network based noncontact SpO$_2$ estimation
scheme using smartphone cameras. The scheme analyzes the videos of a
participant's hand for physiological sensing, which is convenient and
comfortable, and can protect their privacy and allow for keeping face masks on.
We design our neural network architectures inspired by the optophysiological
models for SpO$_2$ measurement and demonstrate the explainability by
visualizing the weights for channel combination. Our proposed models outperform
the state-of-the-art model that is designed for contact-based SpO$_2$

public health. We also analyze the impact of skin type and the side of a hand

SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), many related research topics have been proposed in the

the most critical CT slice should be selected from the original CT scan volume

Convolutional CT scan-Aware Transformer (CCAT) is proposed to discover the
context of the slices fully. The frame-level feature is extracted from each CT
slice based on any backbone network and followed by feeding the features to our
within-slice-Transformer (WST) to discover the context information in the pixel
dimension. The proposed Between-Slice-Transformer (BST) is used to aggregate
the extracted spatial-context features of every CT slice. A simple classifier
is then used to judge whether the Spatio-temporal features are COVID-19 or

years owing to its high performance. However, the quality of
deep-learning-based methods relies heavily on the amount of training data, and
the cost of acquiring a large amount of data is often prohibitive in medical
fields. Therefore, we performed CT modality conversion based on deep learning
requiring only a small number of unsupervised images. The proposed method is
based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) with several extensions
tailored for CT images. This method emphasizes the preservation of the
structure in the processed images and reduction in the amount of training data.
This method was applied to realize the conversion of mega-voltage computed
tomography (MVCT) to kilo-voltage computed tomography (kVCT) images. Training
was performed using several datasets acquired from patients with head and neck
cancer. The size of the datasets ranged from 16 slices (for two patients) to
2745 slices (for 137 patients) of MVCT and 2824 slices of kVCT for 98 patients.
The quality of the processed MVCT images was considerably enhanced, and the
structural changes in the images were minimized. With an increase in the size
of training data, the image quality exhibited a satisfactory convergence from a
few hundred slices. In addition to statistical and visual evaluations, these
results were clinically evaluated by medical doctors in terms of the accuracy
of contouring. We developed an MVCT to kVCT conversion model based on deep
learning, which can be trained using a few hundred unpaired images. The
stability of the model against the change in the data size was demonstrated.
This research promotes the reliable use of deep learning in clinical medicine
by partially answering the commonly asked questions: "Is our data enough? How
much data must we prepare?"]]></summary>

medical detection. However, the acquisition of hyperspectral images is usually
costly due to the complicated apparatus for the acquisition of optical
spectrum. Recently, it has been reported that HSI can be reconstructed from
single RGB image using convolution neural network (CNN) algorithms. Compared
with the traditional hyperspectral cameras, the method based on CNN algorithms
is simple, portable and low cost. In this study, we focused on the influence of
the RGB camera spectral sensitivity (CSS) on the HSI. A Xenon lamp incorporated
with a monochromator were used as the standard light source to calibrate the
CSS. And the experimental results show that the CSS plays a significant role in
the reconstruction accuracy of an HSI. In addition, we proposed a new HSI
reconstruction network where the dimensional structure of the original
hyperspectral datacube was modified by 3D matrix transpose to improve the

detector performance with additional unlabeled data. State-of-the-art SSOD
performance has been achieved recently by self-training, in which training
supervision consists of ground truths and pseudo-labels. In current studies, we
observe that class imbalance in SSOD severely impedes the effectiveness of
self-training. To address the class imbalance, we propose adaptive
class-rebalancing self-training (ACRST) with a novel memory module called
CropBank. ACRST adaptively rebalances the training data with foreground
instances extracted from the CropBank, thereby alleviating the class imbalance.
Owing to the high complexity of detection tasks, we observe that both
self-training and data-rebalancing suffer from noisy pseudo-labels in SSOD.
Therefore, we propose a novel two-stage filtering algorithm to generate
accurate pseudo-labels. Our method achieves satisfactory improvements on
MS-COCO and VOC benchmarks. When using only 1\% labeled data in MS-COCO, our
method achieves 17.02 mAP improvement over supervised baselines, and 5.32 mAP
improvement compared with state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

Lidar inputs, which are often used to train prediction models such as deep
artificial neural networks for decision making for object recognition,

it is vital to measure the reliability of decisions made by such prediction
models via uncertainty measurement. Uncertainty, in deep learning models, is
often measured for classification problems. However, deep learning models in
autonomous driving are often multi-output regression models. Hence, we propose
a novel method called PURE (Prediction sURface uncErtainty) for measuring
prediction uncertainty of such regression models. We formulate the object
recognition problem as a regression model with more than one outputs for
finding object locations in a 2-dimensional camera view. For evaluation, we
modified three widely-applied object recognition models (i.e., YoLo, SSD300 and

between prediction surface uncertainty and prediction accuracy suggesting that

different views to represent one object. Among these works, multi-view
subspace-based clustering has gained extensive attention from many researchers,
which aims to provide clustering solutions to multi-view data. However, most
existing methods fail to take full use of the locality geometric structure and
similarity relationship among samples under the multi-view scenario. To solve
these issues, we propose a novel multi-view learning method with locality
relationship constraint to explore the problem of multi-view clustering, called
Locality Relationship Constrained Multi-view Clustering Framework (LRC-MCF).
LRC-MCF aims to explore the diversity, geometric, consensus and complementary
information among different views, by capturing the locality relationship
information and the common similarity relationships among multiple views.
Moreover, LRC-MCF takes sufficient consideration to weights of different views
in finding the common-view locality structure and straightforwardly produce the
final clusters. To effectually reduce the redundancy of the learned
representations, the low-rank constraint on the common similarity matrix is
considered additionally. To solve the minimization problem of LRC-MCF, an
Alternating Direction Minimization (ADM) method is provided to iteratively
calculate all variables LRC-MCF. Extensive experimental results on seven

temperature measurement and mask detection in public areas are conducted.
However, the existing temperature measurement methods face the problems of

measurement even when a person's face is partially obscured, we propose a
cloud-edge-terminal collaborative system with a lightweight infrared

proposed to realize face alignment and mask detection on the RGB images. For
accurate temperature measurement, we transform the facial landmarks on the RGB
images to the thermal images by an affine transformation and select a more
accurate temperature measurement area on the forehead. The collected
information is uploaded to the cloud in real time for COVID-19 prevention.
Experiments show that the detection model is only 6.1M and the average
detection speed is 257ms. At a distance of 1m, the error of indoor temperature
measurement is about 3%. That is, the proposed system can realize real-time

applications has attracted lots of attention. Yet the majority of CNNs are
unable to satisfy the strict requirement for real-world deployment. To overcome
this, the recent popular network pruning is an effective method to reduce the
redundancy of the models. However, the ranking of filters according to their
"importance" on different pruning criteria may be inconsistent. One filter
could be important according to a certain criterion, while it is unnecessary
according to another one, which indicates that each criterion is only a partial
view of the comprehensive "importance". From this motivation, we propose a
novel framework to integrate the existing filter pruning criteria by exploring
the criteria diversity. The proposed framework contains two stages: Criteria
Clustering and Filters Importance Calibration. First, we condense the pruning
criteria via layerwise clustering based on the rank of "importance" score.
Second, within each cluster, we propose a calibration factor to adjust their
significance for each selected blending candidates and search for the optimal
blending criterion via Evolutionary Algorithm. Quantitative results on the
CIFAR-100 and ImageNet benchmarks show that our framework outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines, regrading to the compact model performance after
pruning.]]></summary>

tasks. In the literature, high localization accuracy is achieved with the
mainstream strongly supervised frameworks. However, such methods require
object-level annotations and are unable to detect objects of unknown
categories. Weakly supervised methods face similar difficulties. In this paper,
a self-paced learning framework is proposed to achieve accurate object
localization on the rank list returned by instance search. The proposed
framework mines the target instance gradually from the queries and their
corresponding top-ranked search results. Since a common instance is shared
between the query and the images in the rank list, the target visual instance
can be accurately localized even without knowing what the object category is.
In addition to performing localization on instance search, the issue of
few-shot object detection is also addressed under the same framework. Superior
performance over state-of-the-art methods is observed on both tasks.]]></summary>

but for medical image segmentation, it is highly challenging to obtain
sufficient annotated images for model training. In many scenarios, unannotated
images are abundant and easy to acquire. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has
shown great potentials in exploiting raw data information and representation
learning. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Supervised Learning
(HSSL), a new self-supervised framework that boosts medical image segmentation
by making good use of unannotated data. Unlike the current literature on
task-specific self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning,
we utilize SSL to learn task-agnostic knowledge from heterogeneous data for
various medical image segmentation tasks. Specifically, we first aggregate a
dataset from several medical challenges, then pre-train the network in a
self-supervised manner, and finally fine-tune on labeled data. We develop a new
loss function by combining contrastive loss and classification loss and
pretrain an encoder-decoder architecture for segmentation tasks. Our extensive
experiments show that multi-domain joint pre-training benefits downstream
segmentation tasks and outperforms single-domain pre-training significantly.
Compared to learning from scratch, our new method yields better performance on
various tasks (e.g., +0.69% to +18.60% in Dice scores with 5% of annotated
data). With limited amounts of training data, our method can substantially
bridge the performance gap w.r.t. denser annotations (e.g., 10% vs.~100% of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Domain adaptation (DA) approaches address domain shift and enable networks to
be applied to different scenarios. Although various image DA approaches have
been proposed in recent years, there is limited research towards video DA. This
is partly due to the complexity in adapting the different modalities of
features in videos, which includes the correlation features extracted as
long-term dependencies of pixels across spatiotemporal dimensions. The
correlation features are highly associated with action classes and proven their
effectiveness in accurate video feature extraction through the supervised
action recognition task. Yet correlation features of the same action would
differ across domains due to domain shift. Therefore we propose a novel
Adversarial Correlation Adaptation Network (ACAN) to align action videos by
aligning pixel correlations. ACAN aims to minimize the distribution of
correlation information, termed as Pixel Correlation Discrepancy (PCD).
Additionally, video DA research is also limited by the lack of cross-domain
video datasets with larger domain shifts. We, therefore, introduce a novel
HMDB-ARID dataset with a larger domain shift caused by a larger statistical
difference between domains. This dataset is built in an effort to leverage
current datasets for dark video classification. Empirical results demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed ACAN for both existing and the
new video DA datasets.]]></summary>

clinical decision support systems. Existing medical image segmentation methods
based on supervised deep learning, however, remain problematic because of their
reliance on large amounts of labelled training data. Although medical imaging
data repositories continue to expand, there has not been a commensurate
increase in the amount of annotated data. Hence, we propose a new spatial
guided self-supervised clustering network (SGSCN) for medical image
segmentation, where we introduce multiple loss functions designed to aid in
grouping image pixels that are spatially connected and have similar feature
representations. It iteratively learns feature representations and clustering
assignment of each pixel in an end-to-end fashion from a single image. We also
propose a context-based consistency loss that better delineates the shape and
boundaries of image regions. It enforces all the pixels belonging to a cluster
to be spatially close to the cluster centre. We evaluated our method on 2
public medical image datasets and compared it to existing conventional and
self-supervised clustering methods. Experimental results show that our method
was most accurate for medical image segmentation.]]></summary>

various data augmentations designed to explore elaborate similarities between

systems. After the perception phase, motion planning is typically performed in
Bird's Eye View (BEV) space. This would require projection of objects detected
on the image plane to top view BEV plane. Such a projection is prone to errors
due to lack of depth information and noisy mapping in far away areas. CNNs can
leverage the global context in the scene to project better. In this work, we
explore end-to-end Moving Object Detection (MOD) on the BEV map directly using
monocular images as input. To the best of our knowledge, such a dataset does
not exist and we create an extended KITTI-raw dataset consisting of 12.9k
images with annotations of moving object masks in BEV space for five classes.
The dataset is intended to be used for class agnostic motion cue based object
detection and classes are provided as meta-data for better tuning. We design
and implement a two-stream RGB and optical flow fusion architecture which
outputs motion segmentation directly in BEV space. We compare it with inverse
perspective mapping of state-of-the-art motion segmentation predictions on the
image plane. We observe a significant improvement of 13% in mIoU using the
simple baseline implementation. This demonstrates the ability to directly learn
motion segmentation output in BEV space. Qualitative results of our baseline

enables us to use unlabeled samples from out-of-data classes which are usually

EPC are capable to visualize multidimensional data and support visual machine
learning with preservation of multidimensional information in 2-D. Relative to
parallel and radial coordinates, EPC visualization requires only a half of the
visual elements for each n-D point. An interactive software system EllipseVis,
which is developed in this work, processes high-dimensional datasets, creates
EPC visualizations, and produces predictive classification models by
discovering dominance rules in EPC. By using interactive and automatic
processes it discovers zones in EPC with a high dominance of a single class.
The EPC methodology has been successful in discovering non-linear predictive
models with high coverage and precision in the computational experiments. This
can benefit multiple domains by producing visually appealing dominance rules.
This chapter presents results of successful testing the EPC non-linear
methodology in experiments using real and simulated data, EPC generalized to
the Dynamic Elliptic Paired Coordinates (DEPC), incorporation of the weights of

i.e., asynchronous pixel-wise brightness changes in the scene. Their high
dynamic range and temporal resolution of a microsecond makes them more reliable
than standard cameras in environments of challenging illumination and in
high-speed scenarios, thus developing odometry algorithms based solely on event
cameras offers exciting new possibilities for autonomous systems and robots. In
this paper, we propose a novel stereo visual odometry method for event cameras
based on feature detection and matching with careful feature management, while
pose estimation is done by reprojection error minimization. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed method on two publicly available datasets: MVSEC
sequences captured by an indoor flying drone and DSEC outdoor driving
sequences. MVSEC offers accurate ground truth from motion capture, while for
DSEC, which does not offer ground truth, in order to obtain a reference
trajectory on the standard camera frames we used our SOFT visual odometry, one
of the highest ranking algorithms on the KITTI scoreboards. We compared our
method to the ESVO method, which is the first and still the only stereo event
odometry method, showing on par performance on the MVSEC sequences, while on
the DSEC dataset ESVO, unlike our method, was unable to handle outdoor driving
scenario with default parameters. Furthermore, two important advantages of our
method over ESVO are that it adapts tracking frequency to the asynchronous
event rate and does not require initialization.]]></summary>

experimentally evaluate the robustness of a Mahalanobis distance-based
confidence score, a simple yet effective method for detecting abnormal input
samples, in classifying malaria parasitized cells and uninfected cells. Results
indicated that the Mahalanobis confidence score detector exhibits improved
performance and robustness of deep learning models, and achieves
stateof-the-art performance on both out-of-distribution (OOD) and adversarial

due to their outstanding ability to be used in different sectors and serve in
difficult and dangerous areas. Moreover, the advancements in computer vision
and artificial intelligence have increased the use of UAVs in various
applications and solutions, such as forest fires detection and borders
monitoring. However, using deep neural networks (DNNs) with UAVs introduces
several challenges of processing deeper networks and complex models, which
restricts their on-board computation. In this work, we present a strategy
aiming at distributing inference requests to a swarm of resource-constrained
UAVs that classifies captured images on-board and finds the minimum
decision-making latency. We formulate the model as an optimization problem that
minimizes the latency between acquiring images and making the final decisions.
The formulated optimization solution is an NP-hard problem. Hence it is not
adequate for online resource allocation. Therefore, we introduce an online
heuristic solution, namely DistInference, to find the layers placement strategy
that gives the best latency among the available UAVs. The proposed approach is
general enough to be used for different low decision-latency applications as
well as for all CNN types organized into the pipeline of layers (e.g., VGG) or
based on residual blocks (e.g., ResNet).]]></summary>

scenario, which relaxes the fully shared label space assumption such that the
source label space subsumes the target one. The key challenge of PDA is the
issue of negative transfer caused by source-only classes. For videos, such
negative transfer could be triggered by both spatial and temporal features,
which leads to a more challenging Partial Video Domain Adaptation (PVDA)
problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Partial Adversarial Temporal
Attentive Network (PATAN) to address the PVDA problem by utilizing both spatial
and temporal features for filtering source-only classes. Besides, PATAN
constructs effective overall temporal features by attending to local temporal
features that contribute more toward the class filtration process. We further
introduce new benchmarks to facilitate research on PVDA problems, covering a
wide range of PVDA scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of our proposed PATAN across the multiple PVDA
benchmarks.]]></summary>

convolutional neural network to learn embeddings of input fibers, using
pairwise fiber distances as pseudo annotations. This enables WMFC that is
insensitive to fiber point ordering. In addition, anatomical coherence of fiber
clusters is improved by incorporating brain anatomical segmentation data. The

correspondences between 3D shapes of the same category. The autoencoder
performs two key functions: (a) encoding an arbitrarily ordered point cloud to
a canonical primitive, e.g., a sphere, and (b) decoding the primitive back to
the original input instance shape. As being placed in the bottleneck, this
primitive plays a key role to map all the unordered point clouds on the
canonical surface and to be reconstructed in an ordered fashion. Once trained,
points from different shape instances that are mapped to the same locations on
the primitive surface are determined to be a pair of correspondence. Our method
does not require any form of annotation or self-supervised part segmentation
network and can handle unaligned input point clouds. Experimental results on 3D
semantic keypoint transfer and part segmentation transfer show that our model
performs favorably against state-of-the-art correspondence learning methods.]]></summary>

tasks to tackle the problem of differently distributed train (source) and test
(target) data. We consider the supervised DA task with a limited number of
annotated samples from the target domain. It corresponds to one of the most
relevant clinical setups: building a sufficiently accurate model on the minimum
possible amount of annotated data. Existing methods mostly fine-tune specific
layers of the pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). However, there is
no consensus on which layers are better to fine-tune, e.g. the first layers for
images with low-level domain shift or the deeper layers for images with
high-level domain shift. To this end, we propose SpotTUnet - a CNN architecture
that automatically chooses the layers which should be optimally fine-tuned.
More specifically, on the target domain, our method additionally learns the
policy that indicates whether a specific layer should be fine-tuned or reused
from the pretrained network. We show that our method performs at the same level
as the best of the nonflexible fine-tuning methods even under the extreme
scarcity of annotated data. Secondly, we show that SpotTUnet policy provides a
layer-wise visualization of the domain shift impact on the network, which could
be further used to develop robust domain generalization methods. In order to
extensively evaluate SpotTUnet performance, we use a publicly available dataset
of brain MR images (CC359), characterized by explicit domain shift. We release
a reproducible experimental pipeline.]]></summary>

imaging technique that allows visualizations of vasculature and foveal
avascular zone (FAZ) across retinal layers. Clinical researches suggest that
the morphology and contour irregularity of FAZ are important biomarkers of
various ocular pathologies. Therefore, precise segmentation of FAZ has great
clinical interest. Also, there is no existing research reporting that FAZ
features can improve the performance of deep diagnostic classification
networks. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level boundary shape and
distance aware joint learning framework, named BSDA-Net, for FAZ segmentation
and diagnostic classification from OCTA images. Two auxiliary branches, namely
boundary heatmap regression and signed distance map reconstruction branches,
are constructed in addition to the segmentation branch to improve the
segmentation performance, resulting in more accurate FAZ contours and fewer
outliers. Moreover, both low-level and high-level features from the
aforementioned three branches, including shape, size, boundary, and signed
directional distance map of FAZ, are fused hierarchically with features from
the diagnostic classifier. Through extensive experiments, the proposed BSDA-Net
is found to yield state-of-the-art segmentation and classification results on

for cases with wrong labels. The ANUW is trained end-to-end to convert an input
single RGB image into a depth image. It consists of a dense residual network

non-local (PSNL) module and a soft label generation method. The dense residual
network is the main body of the network to encode and decode the input. The
AWCA module can adaptively adjust the channel weights to extract important
features. The PSNL module implements the spatial attention mechanism through a
second-order non-local method. The proposed soft label generation method uses
the prior knowledge of the dataset to produce soft labels to replace false

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on one set of medical images often
experience severe performance drop on unseen test images, due to various domain
discrepancy between the training images (source domain) and the test images
(target domain), which raises a domain adaptation issue. In clinical settings,
it is difficult to collect enough annotated target domain data in a short
period. Few-shot domain adaptation, i.e., adapting a trained model with a
handful of annotations, is highly practical and useful in this case. In this
paper, we propose a Polymorphic Transformer (Polyformer), which can be
incorporated into any DNN backbones for few-shot domain adaptation.
Specifically, after the polyformer layer is inserted into a model trained on
the source domain, it extracts a set of prototype embeddings, which can be
viewed as a "basis" of the source-domain features. On the target domain, the
polyformer layer adapts by only updating a projection layer which controls the
interactions between image features and the prototype embeddings. All other
model weights (except BatchNorm parameters) are frozen during adaptation. Thus,
the chance of overfitting the annotations is greatly reduced, and the model can
perform robustly on the target domain after being trained on a few annotated
images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Polyformer on two medical
segmentation tasks (i.e., optic disc/cup segmentation, and polyp segmentation).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Common neural network architectures are susceptible to attack by adversarial
samples. Neural network architectures are commonly thought of as divided into
low-level feature extraction layers and high-level classification layers;
susceptibility of networks to adversarial samples is often thought of as a
problem related to classification rather than feature extraction. We test this
idea by selectively retraining different portions of VGG and ResNet
architectures on CIFAR-10, Imagenette and ImageNet using non-adversarial and
adversarial data. Our experimental results show that susceptibility to
adversarial samples is associated with low-level feature extraction layers.
Therefore, retraining high-level layers is insufficient for achieving
robustness. This phenomenon could have two explanations: either, adversarial
attacks yield outputs from early layers that are indistinguishable from
features found in the attack classes, or adversarial attacks yield outputs from
early layers that differ statistically from features for non-adversarial
samples and do not permit consistent classification by subsequent layers. We
test this question by large-scale non-linear dimensionality reduction and
density modeling on distributions of feature vectors in hidden layers and find
that the feature distributions between non-adversarial and adversarial samples
differ substantially. Our results provide new insights into the statistical
origins of adversarial samples and possible defenses.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surgical phase recognition is of particular interest to computer assisted
surgery systems, in which the goal is to predict what phase is occurring at
each frame for a surgery video. Networks with multi-stage architecture have
been widely applied in many computer vision tasks with rich patterns, where a
predictor stage first outputs initial predictions and an additional refinement
stage operates on the initial predictions to perform further refinement.
Existing works show that surgical video contents are well ordered and contain
rich temporal patterns, making the multi-stage architecture well suited for the
surgical phase recognition task. However, we observe that when simply applying
the multi-stage architecture to the surgical phase recognition task, the
end-to-end training manner will make the refinement ability fall short of its
wishes. To address the problem, we propose a new non end-to-end training
strategy and explore different designs of multi-stage architecture for surgical
phase recognition task. For the non end-to-end training strategy, the
refinement stage is trained separately with proposed two types of disturbed
sequences. Meanwhile, we evaluate three different choices of refinement models
to show that our analysis and solution are robust to the choices of specific
multi-stage models. We conduct experiments on two public benchmarks, the
M2CAI16 Workflow Challenge, and the Cholec80 dataset. Results show that
multi-stage architecture trained with our strategy largely boosts the
performance of the current state-of-the-art single-stage model. Code is

been a key challenge towards Facial Expression Recognition (FER) in the wild.
During early learning stage, deep networks fit on clean data. Then, eventually,
they start overfitting on noisy labels due to their memorization ability, which
limits FER performance. This work proposes an effective training strategy in
the presence of noisy labels, called as Consensual Collaborative Training (CCT)
framework. CCT co-trains three networks jointly using a convex combination of
supervision loss and consistency loss, without making any assumption about the
noise distribution. A dynamic transition mechanism is used to move from
supervision loss in early learning to consistency loss for consensus of
predictions among networks in the later stage. Inference is done using a single
network based on a simple knowledge distillation scheme. Effectiveness of the
proposed framework is demonstrated on synthetic as well as real noisy FER
datasets. In addition, a large test subset of around 5K images is annotated
from the FEC dataset using crowd wisdom of 16 different annotators and reliable
labels are inferred. CCT is also validated on it. State-of-the-art performance
is reported on the benchmark FER datasets RAFDB (90.84%) FERPlus (89.99%) and
AffectNet (66%). Our codes are available at https://github.com/1980x/CCT.]]></summary>

graph convolutional network (GCN) and its variants have been successfully
applied to a broad range of tasks, such as node classification, link
prediction, and graph classification. Traditional GCN models suffer from the
issues of overfitting and oversmoothing, while some recent techniques like
DropEdge could alleviate these issues and thus enable the development of deep
GCN. However, training GCN models is non-trivial, as it is sensitive to the
choice of hyperparameters such as dropout rate and learning weight decay,
especially for deep GCN models. In this paper, we aim to automate the training
of GCN models through hyperparameter optimization. To be specific, we propose a
self-tuning GCN approach with an alternate training algorithm, and further
extend our approach by incorporating the population based training scheme.
Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approaches on optimizing multi-layer GCN, compared with several

to achieve a simpler architecture, which has shallow layers, is simple to

multi-head structure, the model is in a minimal amount of extra parameters.
Every classification head in the unified model interacts with its peers through
a "Weak and Strong Augmentation" strategy, achieving single-view co-training
without promoting diversity explicitly. The effectiveness of Multi-Head
Co-Training is demonstrated in an empirical study on standard semi-supervised

venue for customers wishing to save time and simplify their shopping process. A
key advantage of shopping online is the ability to read what other customers
are saying about products of interest. In this work, we aim to maintain this
advantage in situations where extreme brevity is needed, for example, when
shopping by voice. We suggest a novel task of extracting a single
representative helpful sentence from a set of reviews for a given product. The
selected sentence should meet two conditions: first, it should be helpful for a
purchase decision and second, the opinion it expresses should be supported by
multiple reviewers. This task is closely related to the task of Multi Document
Summarization in the product reviews domain but differs in its objective and
its level of conciseness. We collect a dataset in English of sentence
helpfulness scores via crowd-sourcing and demonstrate its reliability despite
the inherent subjectivity involved. Next, we describe a complete model that
extracts representative helpful sentences with positive and negative sentiment
towards the product and demonstrate that it outperforms several baselines.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few-shot action recognition aims to recognize novel action classes (query)
using just a few samples (support). The majority of current approaches follow
the metric learning paradigm, which learns to compare the similarity between
videos. Recently, it has been observed that directly measuring this similarity
is not ideal since different action instances may show distinctive temporal
distribution, resulting in severe misalignment issues across query and support
videos. In this paper, we arrest this problem from two distinct aspects --
action duration misalignment and motion evolution misalignment. We address them
sequentially through a Two-stage Temporal Alignment Network (TTAN). The first
stage performs temporal transformation with the predicted affine warp
parameters, while the second stage utilizes a cross-attention mechanism to
coordinate the features of the support and query to a consistent evolution.
Besides, we devise a novel multi-shot fusion strategy, which takes the
misalignment among support samples into consideration. Ablation studies and
visualizations demonstrate the role played by both stages in addressing the
misalignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the potential of
the proposed method in achieving state-of-the-art performance for few-shot
action recognition.]]></summary>

Each expert is implemented by a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The experts in
the mixture system are jointly trained by maximizing a mixture of individual
component evidence lower bounds (MELBO) on the log-likelihood of the given
training samples. The mixing coefficients in the mixture, control the
contributions of each expert in the goal representation. These are sampled from
a Dirichlet distribution whose parameters are determined through non-parametric
estimation during lifelong learning. The model can learn new tasks fast when
these are similar to those previously learnt. The proposed Lifelong mixture of
VAE (L-MVAE) expands its architecture with new components when learning a
completely new task. After the training, our model can automatically determine
the relevant expert to be used when fed with new data samples. This mechanism
benefits both the memory efficiency and the required computational cost as only
one expert is used during the inference. The L-MVAE inference model is able to
perform interpolation in the joint latent space across the data domains
associated with different tasks and is shown to be efficient for disentangled

able to understand rich video contents and perform spatial-temporal reasoning.
However, existing graph-based methods fail to perform multi-step reasoning
well, neglecting two properties of VideoQA: (1) Even for the same video,
different questions may require different amount of video clips or objects to
infer the answer with relational reasoning; (2) During reasoning, appearance
and motion features have complicated interdependence which are correlated and
complementary to each other. Based on these observations, we propose a
Dual-Visual Graph Reasoning Unit (DualVGR) which reasons over videos in an

explainable Query Punishment Module, which can filter out irrelevant visual
features through multiple cycles of reasoning. The second contribution is the
proposed Video-based Multi-view Graph Attention Network, which captures the
relations between appearance and motion features. Our DualVGR network achieves

incorporate geometry constraints during training. Multi-scale outputs from the
generator help to solve the local minima caused by the photometric reprojection
loss, while the adversarial learning improves the framework generation quality.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that SADepth outperforms
recent state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a large margin, and reduces the
gap between supervised and unsupervised depth estimation in laparoscopic

severity of retinal degenerative diseases such as age-related macular
degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy (DR) in clinical
practice, for which the fovea and optic disc (OD) are important retinal
landmarks. However, the occurrence of lesions, drusen, and other retinal
abnormalities during retinal degeneration severely complicates automatic
landmark detection and segmentation. Here we propose HBA-U-Net: a U-Net
backbone enriched with hierarchical bottleneck attention. The network consists
of a novel bottleneck attention block that combines and refines self-attention,
channel attention, and relative-position attention to highlight retinal
abnormalities that may be important for fovea and OD segmentation in the
degenerated retina. HBA-U-Net achieved state-of-the-art results on fovea
detection across datasets and eye conditions (ADAM: Euclidean Distance (ED) of
25.4 pixels, REFUGE: 32.5 pixels, IDRiD: 32.1 pixels), on OD segmentation for
AMD (ADAM: Dice Coefficient (DC) of 0.947), and on OD detection for DR (IDRiD:
ED of 20.5 pixels). Our results suggest that HBA-U-Net may be well suited for
landmark detection in the presence of a variety of retinal degenerative
diseases.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[End-to-end spoken language understanding (SLU) has recently attracted
increasing interest. Compared to the conventional tandem-based approach that
combines speech recognition and language understanding as separate modules, the
new approach extracts users' intentions directly from the speech signals,
resulting in joint optimization and low latency. Such an approach, however, is
typically designed to process one intention at a time, which leads users to
take multiple rounds to fulfill their requirements while interacting with a
dialogue system. In this paper, we propose a streaming end-to-end framework
that can process multiple intentions in an online and incremental way. The
backbone of our framework is a unidirectional RNN trained with the
connectionist temporal classification (CTC) criterion. By this design, an
intention can be identified when sufficient evidence has been accumulated, and
multiple intentions can be identified sequentially. We evaluate our solution on
the Fluent Speech Commands (FSC) dataset and the intent detection accuracy is
about 97 % on all multi-intent settings. This result is comparable to the
performance of the state-of-the-art non-streaming models, but is achieved in an
online and incremental way. We also employ our model to a keyword spotting task
using the Google Speech Commands dataset and the results are also highly
promising.]]></summary>

learn priors on future states given the past and maintains a probability
distribution over possible futures given a particular sample. In addition, we
leverage the changes in this distribution over time to control the sampling of
diverse future states by estimating the end of ongoing sequences. That is, we
use the variance of GP over the output function space to trigger a change in an
action sequence. We achieve state-of-the-art results on diverse future frame
generation in terms of reconstruction quality and diversity of the generated

projections on multiple camera images. For solving this problem, it is the
common practice to use so-called optimal triangulation method, which we call
the L2 method in this paper. But, the method can be optimal only if we assume
no uncertainty in the camera parameters. Through extensive comparison on
synthetic and real data, we observed that the L2 method is actually not the
best choice when there is uncertainty in the camera parameters. Interestingly,
it can be observed that the simple mid-point method outperforms other methods.
Apart from its high performance, the mid-point method has a simple closed
formed solution for multiple camera images while the L2 method is hard to be
used for more than two camera images. Therefore, in contrast to the common
practice, we argue that the simple mid-point method should be used in
structure-from-motion applications where there is uncertainty in camera
parameters.]]></summary>

considerable efforts have been made to train BERT progressively -- start from

Transformer growth and discover principles that guide progressive training.
First, we find that similar to network architecture search, Transformer growth
also favors compound scaling. Specifically, while existing methods only conduct
network growth in a single dimension, we observe that it is beneficial to use
compound growth operators and balance multiple dimensions (e.g., depth, width,
and input length of the model). Moreover, we explore alternative growth
operators in each dimension via controlled comparison to give operator
selection practical guidance. In light of our analyses, the proposed method
speeds up BERT pre-training by 73.6% and 82.2% for the base and large models

transcription-style automatic speech recognition (RT-ASR) systems from
small-scale rich transcription-style and large-scale common transcription-style
datasets. In spontaneous speech tasks, various speech phenomena such as
fillers, word fragments, laughter and coughs, etc. are often included. While
common transcriptions do not give special awareness to these phenomena, rich
transcriptions explicitly convert them into special phenomenon tokens as well
as textual tokens. In previous studies, the textual and phenomenon tokens were
simultaneously estimated in an end-to-end manner. However, it is difficult to
build accurate RT-ASR systems because large-scale rich transcription-style
datasets are often unavailable. To solve this problem, our training method uses
a limited rich transcription-style dataset and common transcription-style
dataset simultaneously. The Key process in our semi-supervised learning is to
convert the common transcription-style dataset into a pseudo-rich
transcription-style dataset. To this end, we introduce style tokens which
control phenomenon tokens are generated or not into transformer-based
autoregressive modeling. We use this modeling for generating the pseudo-rich
transcription-style datasets and for building RT-ASR system from the pseudo and

encodes authentic contents, our article presents an evolutionary algorithm
which aims to find the most optimal mapping between voynichian glyphs and
candidate phonemic values. Core component of the decoding algorithm is a
process of maximization of a fitness function which aims to find most optimal
set of substitution rules allowing to transcribe the part of the manuscript --
which we call the Calendar -- into lists of feminine names. This leads to sets
of character subsitution rules which allow us to consistently transcribe dozens
among three hundred calendar tokens into feminine names: a result far
surpassing both ``popular'' as well as "state of the art" tentatives to crack
the manuscript. What's more, by using name lists stemming from different
languages as potential cribs, our ``adaptive'' method can also be useful in
identification of the language in which the manuscript is written.

As far as we can currently tell, results of our experiments indicate that the
Calendar part of the manuscript contains names from baltoslavic, balkanic or
hebrew language strata. Two further indications are also given: primo, highest
fitness values were obtained when the crib list contains names with specific
infixes at token's penultimate position as is the case, for example, for slavic
\textbf{feminine diminutives} (i.e. names ending with -ka and not -a). In the
most successful scenario, 240 characters contained in 35 distinct Voynichese
tokens were successfully transcribed. Secundo, in case of crib stemming from
Hebrew language, whole adaptation process converges to significantly better
fitness values when transcribing voynichian tokens whose order of individual
characters have been reversed, and when lists feminine and not masculine names
are used as the crib.]]></summary>

typically trained on a large amount of image data. By minimizing the
cross-entropy loss between a prediction and a given class label, the NN and its
visual embedding space are learned to fulfill a given task. However, due to the
sole dependence on the image data distribution of the training domain, these
models tend to fail when applied to a target domain that differs from their
source domain. To learn a more robust NN to domain shifts, we propose the
knowledge graph neural network (KG-NN), a neuro-symbolic approach that
supervises the training using image-data-invariant auxiliary knowledge. The
auxiliary knowledge is first encoded in a knowledge graph with respective
concepts and their relationships, which is then transformed into a dense vector
representation via an embedding method. Using a contrastive loss function,
KG-NN learns to adapt its visual embedding space and thus its weights according
to the image-data invariant knowledge graph embedding space. We evaluate KG-NN
on visual transfer learning tasks for classification using the mini-ImageNet
dataset and its derivatives, as well as road sign recognition datasets from
Germany and China. The results show that a visual model trained with a
knowledge graph as a trainer outperforms a model trained with cross-entropy in
all experiments, in particular when the domain gap increases. Besides better
performance and stronger robustness to domain shifts, these KG-NN adapts to
multiple datasets and classes without suffering heavily from catastrophic
forgetting.]]></summary>

information, which provide governments and relief agencies real-time data for
better disaster management. However, research in this field has not received
sufficient attention and extracting useful information is still challenging.
This paper aims to improve disaster relief efficiency via mining and analyzing
social media data like public attitudes towards disaster response and public
demands for targeted relief supplies during different types of disasters. We
focus on different natural disasters based on properties such as types,
durations, and damages, which contains a total of 41,993 tweets. In this paper,
public perception is assessed qualitatively by manually classified tweets,
which contain information like the demand for targeted relief supplies,
satisfactions of disaster response, and public fear. Public attitudes to
natural disasters are studied via a quantitative analysis using eight machine
learning models. To better provide decision-makers with the appropriate model,
the comparison of machine learning models based on computational time and
prediction accuracy is conducted. The change of public opinion during different
natural disasters and the evolution of people's behavior of using social media
for disaster relief in the face of the identical type of natural disasters as
Twitter continues to evolve are studied. The results in this paper demonstrate
the feasibility and validation of the proposed research approach and provide
relief agencies with insights into better disaster management.]]></summary>

recognition in a variety of complex environments to promote its development.
The OLR 2020 Challenge includes three tasks: (1) cross-channel language
identification, (2) dialect identification, and (3) noisy language
identification. We choose Cavg as the principle evaluation metric, and the
Equal Error Rate (EER) as the secondary metric. There were 58 teams
participating in this challenge and one third of the teams submitted valid
results. Compared with the best baseline, the Cavg values of Top 1 system for
the three tasks were relatively reduced by 82%, 62% and 48%, respectively. This
paper describes the three tasks, the database profile, and the final results.
We also outline the novel approaches that improve the performance of language
recognition systems most significantly, such as the utilization of auxiliary

grammar that models one-to-one correspondences between words and the
constituency grammar that models the assembly of one or several corresponded

inducing one class of grammars, we introduce a novel model, StructFormer, that
can simultaneously induce dependency and constituency structure. To achieve
this, we propose a new parsing framework that can jointly generate a
constituency tree and dependency graph. Then we integrate the induced

a novel dependency-constrained self-attention mechanism. Experimental results

considerable improvements with the addition of multiple new datasets and
models. However, at present, there is no coherent framework for applying
state-of-the-art models for Danish. We present DaCy: a unified framework for
Danish NLP built on SpaCy. DaCy uses efficient multitask models which obtain
state-of-the-art performance on named entity recognition, part-of-speech
tagging, and dependency parsing. DaCy contains tools for easy integration of
existing models such as for polarity, emotion, or subjectivity detection. In
addition, we conduct a series of tests for biases and robustness of Danish NLP
pipelines through augmentation of the test set of DaNE. DaCy large compares
favorably and is especially robust to long input lengths and spelling
variations and errors. All models except DaCy large display significant biases
related to ethnicity while only Polyglot shows a significant gender bias. We
argue that for languages with limited benchmark sets, data augmentation can be
particularly useful for obtaining more realistic and fine-grained performance
estimates. We provide a series of augmenters as a first step towards a more
thorough evaluation of language models for low and medium resource languages

other layers frozen. For each task, we train independently a single-task (ST)

each ST model using knowledge distillation. Those compressed ST models are
finally merged into one MT model so that the frozen layers of the former are
shared across the tasks. We exemplify our approach on eight GLUE tasks,
demonstrating that it is able to achieve both strong performance and

challenging task that is getting more and more attention. Recently, generative
adversarial net (GAN) has shown promising results in category text generation.
However, the texts generated by GANs usually suffer from the problems of mode
collapse and training instability. To avoid the above problems, we propose a
novel model named category-aware variational recurrent neural network
(CatVRNN), which is inspired by multi-task learning. In our model, generation
and classification are trained simultaneously, aiming at generating texts of
different categories. Moreover, the use of multi-task learning can improve the
quality of generated texts, when the classification task is appropriate. And we
propose a function to initialize the hidden state of CatVRNN to force model to
generate texts of a specific category. Experimental results on three datasets
demonstrate that our model can do better than several state-of-the-art text

which the case's facts are automatically recognized by comprehensively
understanding the multi-role dialogues of the court debate, and then learnt to
discriminate the claims so as to reach the final judgment through multi-task
learning. An extensive set of experiments with a large civil trial data set
shows that the proposed model can more accurately characterize the interactions
among claims, fact and debate for legal judgment prediction, achieving
significant improvements over strong state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, the

predictions can also be interpretable and easily observed, and thus enhancing

phones to remain linked in training, which is highly desirable for information
sharing for multilingual and crosslingual speech recognition methods for
low-resourced languages. A drawback suffered by previous methods in using
phonological features is that the acoustic-to-PF extraction in a bottom-up way
is itself difficult. In this paper, we propose to join phonology driven phone
embedding (top-down) and deep neural network (DNN) based acoustic feature
extraction (bottom-up) to calculate phone probabilities. The new method is
called JoinAP (Joining of Acoustics and Phonology). Remarkably, no inversion
from acoustics to phonological features is required for speech recognition. For
each phone in the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) table, we encode its
phonological features to a phonological-vector, and then apply linear or
nonlinear transformation of the phonological-vector to obtain the phone
embedding. A series of multilingual and crosslingual (both zero-shot and
few-shot) speech recognition experiments are conducted on the CommonVoice
dataset (German, French, Spanish and Italian) and the AISHLL-1 dataset

increased along with terminology, constructs, and measures. Proper
classification of organizational performance constructs from research articles
plays an important role in categorizing the literature and understanding to
whom its research implications may be relevant. In this work, we classify
constructs (i.e., concepts and terminology used to capture different aspects of
organizational performance) in research articles into a three-level
categorization: (a) performance and non-performance categories (Level 0); (b)
for performance constructs, stakeholder group-level of performance concerning
investors, customers, employees, and the society (community and natural
environment) (Level 1); and (c) for each stakeholder group-level, subcategories
of different ways of measurement (Level 2). We observed that increasing
contextual information with features extracted from surrounding sentences and
external references improves classification of disaggregate-level labels, given
limited training data. Our research has implications for computer-assisted
construct identification and classification - an essential step for research

the context and the last dialogue states to track current dialogue states,
which are often slot-value pairs. Although the context contains the complete
dialogue information, the information is usually indirect and even requires
reasoning to obtain. The information in the lastly predicted dialogue states is
direct, but when there is a prediction error, the dialogue information from
this source will be incomplete or erroneous. In this paper, we propose the
Dialogue State Tracking with Multi-Level Fusion of Predicted Dialogue States
and Conversations network (FPDSC). This model extracts information of each
dialogue turn by modeling interactions among each turn utterance, the
corresponding last dialogue states, and dialogue slots. Then the representation
of each dialogue turn is aggregated by a hierarchical structure to form the
passage information, which is utilized in the current turn of DST. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of the fusion network with 55.03% and 59.07%
joint accuracy on MultiWOZ 2.0 and MultiWOZ 2.1 datasets, which reaches the
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we conduct the deleted-value and
related-slot experiments on MultiWOZ 2.1 to evaluate our model.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is beneficial to automate the process of deriving concept hierarchies from
corpora since a manual construction of concept hierarchies is typically a
time-consuming and resource-intensive process. As such, the overall process of
learning concept hierarchies from corpora encompasses a set of steps: parsing
the text into sentences, splitting the sentences and then tokenising it. After
the lemmatisation step, the pairs are extracted using FCA. However, there might
be some uninteresting and erroneous pairs in the formal context. Generating
formal context may lead to a time-consuming process, so formal context size
reduction is required to remove uninterested and erroneous pairs, taking less
time to extract the concept lattice and concept hierarchies accordingly. In
this premise, this study aims to propose two frameworks: (1) A framework to
review the current process of deriving concept hierarchies from corpus
utilising FCA; (2) A framework to decrease the formal contexts ambiguity of the
first framework using an adaptive version of ECA*. Experiments are conducted by
applying 385 sample corpora from Wikipedia on the two frameworks to examine the
reducing size of formal context, which leads to yield concept lattice and
concept hierarchy. The resulting lattice of formal context is evaluated to the
standard one using concept lattice-invariants. Accordingly, the homomorphic
between the two lattices preserves the quality of resulting concept hierarchies
by 89% in contrast to the basic ones, and the reduced concept lattice inherits
the structural relation of the standard one. The adaptive ECA* is examined
against its four counterpart baseline algorithms to measure the execution time
on random datasets with different densities (fill ratios). The results show
that adaptive ECA* performs concept lattice faster than other mentioned
competitive techniques in different fill ratios.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, neural networks have been successfully employed to improve upon
state-of-the-art performance in ad-hoc retrieval tasks via machine-learned
ranking functions. While neural retrieval models grow in complexity and impact,
little is understood about their correspondence with well-studied IR
principles. Recent work on interpretability in machine learning has provided
tools and techniques to understand neural models in general, yet there has been
little progress towards explaining ranking models.

We investigate whether one can explain the behavior of neural ranking models
in terms of their congruence with well understood principles of document
ranking by using established theories from axiomatic IR. Axiomatic analysis of
information retrieval models has formalized a set of constraints on ranking
decisions that reasonable retrieval models should fulfill. We operationalize
this axiomatic thinking to reproduce rankings based on combinations of
elementary constraints. This allows us to investigate to what extent the
ranking decisions of neural rankers can be explained in terms of retrieval
axioms, and which axioms apply in which situations. Our experimental study
considers a comprehensive set of axioms over several representative neural
rankers. While the existing axioms can already explain the particularly
confident ranking decisions rather well, future work should extend the axiom
set to also cover the other still "unexplainable" neural IR rank decisions.]]></summary>

for pre-training speech representation models. The utility of these learned

about the type or extent of information encoded in the pre-trained

capabilities and limits of these models and enable the research community to
more efficiently develop their usage for downstream applications. In this work,
we begin to fill this gap by examining one recent and successful pre-trained
model (wav2vec 2.0), via its intermediate representation vectors, using a suite
of analysis tools. We use the metrics of canonical correlation, mutual
information, and performance on simple downstream tasks with non-parametric
probes, in order to (i) query for acoustic and linguistic information content,
(ii) characterize the evolution of information across model layers, and (iii)
understand how fine-tuning the model for automatic speech recognition (ASR)
affects these observations. Our findings motivate modifying the fine-tuning
protocol for ASR, which produces improved word error rates in a low-resource
setting.]]></summary>

building knowledge graph, but without constructing patent knowledge graph using
patent documents and combining latest natural language processing methods to
mine hidden rich semantic relationships in existing patents and predict new
possible patents. In this paper, we propose a new patent vacancy prediction
approach named PatentMiner to mine rich semantic knowledge and predict new
potential patents based on knowledge graph (KG) and graph attention mechanism.
Firstly, patent knowledge graph over time (e.g. year) is constructed by
carrying out named entity recognition and relation extrac-tion from patent
documents. Secondly, Common Neighbor Method (CNM), Graph Attention Networks
(GAT) and Context-enhanced Graph Attention Networks (CGAT) are proposed to
perform link prediction in the constructed knowledge graph to dig out the
potential triples. Finally, patents are defined on the knowledge graph by means
of co-occurrence relationship, that is, each patent is represented as a fully
connected subgraph containing all its entities and co-occurrence relationships
of the patent in the knowledge graph; Furthermore, we propose a new patent
prediction task which predicts a fully connected subgraph with newly added
prediction links as a new pa-tent. The experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed patent predic-tion approach can correctly predict new patents and
Context-enhanced Graph Attention Networks is much better than the baseline.
Meanwhile, our proposed patent vacancy prediction task still has significant

encodes authentic contents, our article presents an evolutionary algorithm
which aims to find the most optimal mapping between voynichian glyphs and
candidate phonemic values. Core component of the decoding algorithm is a
process of maximization of a fitness function which aims to find most optimal
set of substitution rules allowing to transcribe the part of the manuscript --
which we call the Calendar -- into lists of feminine names. This leads to sets
of character subsitution rules which allow us to consistently transcribe dozens
among three hundred calendar tokens into feminine names: a result far
surpassing both ``popular'' as well as "state of the art" tentatives to crack
the manuscript. What's more, by using name lists stemming from different
languages as potential cribs, our ``adaptive'' method can also be useful in
identification of the language in which the manuscript is written.

As far as we can currently tell, results of our experiments indicate that the
Calendar part of the manuscript contains names from baltoslavic, balkanic or
hebrew language strata. Two further indications are also given: primo, highest
fitness values were obtained when the crib list contains names with specific
infixes at token's penultimate position as is the case, for example, for slavic
\textbf{feminine diminutives} (i.e. names ending with -ka and not -a). In the
most successful scenario, 240 characters contained in 35 distinct Voynichese
tokens were successfully transcribed. Secundo, in case of crib stemming from
Hebrew language, whole adaptation process converges to significantly better
fitness values when transcribing voynichian tokens whose order of individual
characters have been reversed, and when lists feminine and not masculine names
are used as the crib.]]></summary>

short-term and sequential patterns from the evolution of user behaviors. Among
the studies in the SBR field, graph-based approaches are a relatively powerful
kind of way, which generally extract item information by message aggregation
under Euclidean space. However, such methods can't effectively extract the
hierarchical information contained among consecutive items in a session, which
is critical to represent users' preferences. In this paper, we present a
hyperbolic contrastive graph recommender (HCGR), a principled session-based
recommendation framework involving Lorentz hyperbolic space to adequately
capture the coherence and hierarchical representations of the items. Within
this framework, we design a novel adaptive hyperbolic attention computation to
aggregate the graph message of each user's preference in a session-based
behavior sequence. In addition, contrastive learning is leveraged to optimize
the item representation by considering the geodesic distance between positive
and negative samples in hyperbolic space. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets demonstrate that HCGR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 0.43$\%$-28.84$\%$ in terms of $HitRate$, $NDCG$

applications, and standard corpora exist for developing and evaluating
approaches. There has been far less research on spoken question answering (SQA)
systems. The SQA task considered in this paper is to extract the answer from a
candidate$\text{'}$s spoken response to a question in a prompt-response style
language assessment test. Applying these MC approaches to this SQA task rather
than, for example, off-topic response detection provides far more detailed
information that can be used for further downstream processing. One significant
challenge is the lack of appropriately annotated speech corpora to train
systems for this task. Hence, a transfer-learning style approach is adopted
where a system trained on text-based MC is evaluated on an SQA task with
non-native speakers. Mismatches must be considered between text documents and
spoken responses; non-native spoken grammar and written grammar. In practical
SQA, ASR systems are used, necessitating an investigation of the impact of ASR
errors. We show that a simple text-based ELECTRA MC model trained on SQuAD2.0

exceedingly overwhelming for human researchers who seek to timely extract and
review knowledge. This paper introduces natural language processing (NLP)
models to accelerate the discovery, extraction, and organization of theoretical
developments (i.e., hypotheses) from social science publications. We illustrate
and evaluate NLP models in the context of a systematic review of stakeholder
value constructs and hypotheses. Specifically, we develop NLP models to
automatically 1) detect sentences in scholarly documents as hypotheses or not
(Hypothesis Detection), 2) deconstruct the hypotheses into nodes (constructs)
and links (causal/associative relationships) (Relationship Deconstruction ),
and 3) classify the features of links in terms causality (versus association)
and direction (positive, negative, versus nonlinear) (Feature Classification).
Our models have reported high performance metrics for all three tasks. While
our models are built in Python, we have made the pre-trained models fully
accessible for non-programmers. We have provided instructions on installing and
using our pre-trained models via an R Shiny app graphic user interface (GUI).
Finally, we suggest the next paths to extend our methodology for
computer-assisted knowledge synthesis.]]></summary>

of various word embeddings and language models on the existing benchmark

modern edge devices. Past work developed streaming End-to-End (E2E) all-neural
speech recognizers that can run compactly on edge devices. However, E2E ASR
models are prone to overfitting and have difficulties in generalizing to unseen

of ASR models, including layer normalization, dropout, spectrum data
augmentation and speed distortions in the inputs. In this work, we present a
simple yet effective noisy training strategy to further improve the E2E ASR
model training. By introducing random noise to the parameter space during
training, our method can produce smoother models at convergence that generalize
better. We apply noisy training to improve both dense and sparse
state-of-the-art Emformer models and observe consistent WER reduction.
Specifically, when training Emformers with 90% sparsity, we achieve 12% and 14%

a smooth curve relating target subset (%) vs. exact match (%), and (4)
referencing the curve to mine ad-hoc (target subset, exact match) points. We

practice dominating leaderboards across various NLP tasks. Despite its recent
success and wide adoption, this process is unstable when there are only a small
number of training samples available. The brittleness of this process is often
reflected by the sensitivity to random seeds. In this paper, we propose to
tackle this problem based on the noise stability property of deep nets, which
is investigated in recent literature (Arora et al., 2018; Sanyal et al., 2020).
Specifically, we introduce a novel and effective regularization method to
improve fine-tuning on NLP tasks, referred to as Layer-wise Noise Stability
Regularization (LNSR). We extend the theories about adding noise to the input
and prove that our method gives a stabler regularization effect. We provide
supportive evidence by experimentally confirming that well-performing models
show a low sensitivity to noise and fine-tuning with LNSR exhibits clearly
higher generalizability and stability. Furthermore, our method also
demonstrates advantages over other state-of-the-art algorithms including L2-SP
(Li et al., 2018), Mixout (Lee et al., 2020) and SMART (Jiang et al., 2020).]]></summary>

architecture, we have more effective and dynamic applications. Semantic
matchmaking process is finding valuable service candidates for substitution. It
is a very important aspect of using semantic Web Services. Our proposed
matchmaker algorithm performs semantic matching of Web Services on the basis of
input and output descriptions of semantic Web Services matching. This technique
takes advantages from a graph structure and flow networks. Our novel approach
is assigning matchmaking scores to semantics of the inputs and outputs
parameters and their types. It makes a flow network in which the weights of the
edges are these scores, using FordFulkerson algorithm, we find matching rate of
two web services. So, all services should be described in the same Ontology Web
Language. Among these candidates, best one is chosen for substitution in the
case of an execution failure. Our approach uses the algorithm that has the
least running time among all others that can be used for bipartite matching.
The importance of problem is that in real systems, many fundamental problems
will occur by late answering. So system`s service should always be on and if
one of them crashes, it would be replaced fast. Semantic web matchmaker eases
this process.]]></summary>

recommender systems. Without any historical interaction on cold-start items, CF
scheme fails to use collaborative signals to infer user preference on these
items. To solve this problem, extensive studies have been conducted to
incorporate side information into the CF scheme. Specifically, they employ
modern neural network techniques (e.g., dropout, consistency constraint) to
discover and exploit the coalition effect of content features and collaborative
representations. However, we argue that these works less explore the mutual
dependencies between content features and collaborative representations and
lack sufficient theoretical supports, thus resulting in unsatisfactory
performance. In this work, we reformulate the cold-start item representation
learning from an information-theoretic standpoint. It aims to maximize the
mutual dependencies between item content and collaborative signals.
Specifically, the representation learning is theoretically lower-bounded by the
integration of two terms: mutual information between collaborative embeddings
of users and items, and mutual information between collaborative embeddings and
feature representations of items. To model such a learning process, we devise a
new objective function founded upon contrastive learning and develop a simple
yet effective Contrastive Learning-based Cold-start Recommendation
framework(CLCRec). In particular, CLCRec consists of three components:
contrastive pair organization, contrastive embedding, and contrastive
optimization modules. It allows us to preserve collaborative signals in the
content representations for both warm and cold-start items. Through extensive
experiments on four publicly accessible datasets, we observe that CLCRec
achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both
warm- and cold-start scenarios.]]></summary>

violence, which makes the polarization properties of large algorithmic content
selection systems (recommender systems) a matter of concern for peace and
security. While algorithm-driven social media does not seem to be a primary
driver of polarization at the country level, it could be a useful intervention
point in polarized societies. This paper examines algorithmic depolarization
interventions with the goal of conflict transformation: not suppressing or
eliminating conflict but moving towards more constructive conflict. Algorithmic
intervention is considered at three stages: which content is available
(moderation), how content is selected and personalized (ranking), and content
presentation and controls (user interface). Empirical studies of online
conflict suggest that the exposure diversity intervention proposed as an
antidote to "filter bubbles" can be improved and can even worsen polarization
under some conditions. Using civility metrics in conjunction with diversity in
content selection may be more effective. However, diversity-based interventions
have not been tested at scale and may not work in the diverse and dynamic
contexts of real platforms. Instead, intervening in platform polarization
dynamics will likely require continuous monitoring of polarization metrics,
such as the widely used "feeling thermometer." These metrics can be used to
evaluate product features, and potentially engineered as algorithmic
objectives. It may further prove necessary to include polarization measures in
the objective functions of recommender algorithms to prevent optimization
processes from creating conflict as a side effect.]]></summary>

utilize the recurrent neural network architecture or self-attention to model
the sequential patterns and temporal influence among a user's historical
behavior and learn the user's preference at a specific time. However, these
methods have two main drawbacks. First, they focus on modeling users' dynamic
states from a user-centric perspective and always neglect the dynamics of items
over time. Second, most of them deal with only the first-order user-item
interactions and do not consider the high-order connectivity between users and
items, which has recently been proved helpful for the sequential
recommendation. To address the above problems, in this article, we attempt to
model user-item interactions by a bipartite graph structure and propose a new
recommendation approach based on a Position-enhanced and Time-aware Graph
Convolutional Network (PTGCN) for the sequential recommendation. PTGCN models
the sequential patterns and temporal dynamics between user-item interactions by
defining a position-enhanced and time-aware graph convolution operation and
learning the dynamic representations of users and items simultaneously on the
bipartite graph with a self-attention aggregator. Also, it realizes the
high-order connectivity between users and items by stacking multi-layer graph
convolutions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PTGCN, we carried out a
comprehensive evaluation of PTGCN on three real-world datasets of different
sizes compared with a few competitive baselines. Experimental results indicate
that PTGCN outperforms several state-of-the-art models in terms of two
commonly-used evaluation metrics for ranking.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper presents an attempt to employ the mask language modeling approach
of BERT to pre-train a 12-layer Transformer model over 4,166 pieces of
polyphonic piano MIDI files for tackling a number of symbolic-domain
discriminative music understanding tasks. These include two note-level
classification tasks, i.e., melody extraction and velocity prediction, as well
as two sequence-level classification tasks, i.e., composer classification and
emotion classification. We find that, given a pre-trained Transformer, our
models outperform recurrent neural network based baselines with less than 10
epochs of fine-tuning. Ablation studies show that the pre-training remains
effective even if none of the MIDI data of the downstream tasks are seen at the
pre-training stage, and that freezing the self-attention layers of the
Transformer at the fine-tuning stage slightly degrades performance. All the
five datasets employed in this work are publicly available, as well as
checkpoints of our pre-trained and fine-tuned models. As such, our research can
be taken as a benchmark for symbolic-domain music understanding.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown powerful ability in
collaborative filtering, which is a widely adopted recommendation scenario.
While without any side information, existing graph neural network based methods
generally learn a one-hot embedding for each user or item as the initial input
representation of GNNs. However, such one-hot embedding is intrinsically
transductive, making these methods with no inductive ability, i.e., failing to
deal with new users or new items that are unseen during training. Besides, the
number of model parameters depends on the number of users and items, which is
expensive and not scalable. In this paper, we give a formal definition of
inductive recommendation and solve the above problems by proposing Inductive
representation based Graph Convolutional Network (IGCN) for collaborative
filtering. Specifically, we design an inductive representation layer, which
utilizes the interaction behavior with core users or items as the initial
representation, improving the general recommendation performance while bringing
inductive ability. Note that, the number of parameters of IGCN only depends on
the number of core users or items, which is adjustable and scalable. Extensive
experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of IGCN in both transductive and inductive recommendation
scenarios, while with remarkably fewer model parameters. Our implementations
are available here in PyTorch.]]></summary>

tasks. In the literature, high localization accuracy is achieved with the
mainstream strongly supervised frameworks. However, such methods require
object-level annotations and are unable to detect objects of unknown
categories. Weakly supervised methods face similar difficulties. In this paper,
a self-paced learning framework is proposed to achieve accurate object
localization on the rank list returned by instance search. The proposed
framework mines the target instance gradually from the queries and their
corresponding top-ranked search results. Since a common instance is shared
between the query and the images in the rank list, the target visual instance
can be accurately localized even without knowing what the object category is.
In addition to performing localization on instance search, the issue of
few-shot object detection is also addressed under the same framework. Superior
performance over state-of-the-art methods is observed on both tasks.]]></summary>

performance of recommendation algorithms. Recommender systems are generally
trained and evaluated on samples of larger datasets. Samples are often taken in
a naive or ad-hoc fashion: e.g. by sampling a dataset randomly or by selecting
users or items with many interactions. As we demonstrate, commonly-used data
sampling schemes can have significant consequences on algorithm performance --
masking performance deficiencies in algorithms or altering the relative
performance of algorithms, as compared to models trained on the complete
dataset. Following this observation, this paper makes the following main
contributions: (1) characterizing the effect of sampling on algorithm
performance, in terms of algorithm and dataset characteristics (e.g. sparsity
characteristics, sequential dynamics, etc.); and (2) designing SVP-CF, which is
a data-specific sampling strategy, that aims to preserve the relative
performance of models after sampling, and is especially suited to long-tail
interaction data. Detailed experiments show that SVP-CF is more accurate than
commonly used sampling schemes in retaining the relative ranking of different

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Social-aware recommendation approaches have been recognized as an effective
way to solve the data sparsity issue of traditional recommender systems. The
assumption behind is that the knowledge in social user-user connections can be
shared and transferred to the domain of user-item interactions, whereby to help
learn user preferences. However, most existing approaches merely adopt the
first-order connections among users during transfer learning, ignoring those
connections in higher orders. We argue that better recommendation performance
can also benefit from high-order social relations. In this paper, we propose a
novel Propagation-aware Transfer Learning Network (PTLN) based on the
propagation of social relations. We aim to better mine the sharing knowledge
hidden in social networks and thus further improve recommendation performance.
Specifically, we explore social influence in two aspects: (a) higher-order
friends have been taken into consideration by order bias; (b) different friends
in the same order will have distinct importance for recommendation by an
attention mechanism. Besides, we design a novel regularization to bridge the
gap between social relations and user-item interactions. We conduct extensive
experiments on two real-world datasets and beat other counterparts in terms of
ranking accuracy, especially for the cold-start users with few historical
interactions.]]></summary>

recommender systems. Without any historical interaction on cold-start items, CF
scheme fails to use collaborative signals to infer user preference on these
items. To solve this problem, extensive studies have been conducted to
incorporate side information into the CF scheme. Specifically, they employ
modern neural network techniques (e.g., dropout, consistency constraint) to
discover and exploit the coalition effect of content features and collaborative
representations. However, we argue that these works less explore the mutual
dependencies between content features and collaborative representations and
lack sufficient theoretical supports, thus resulting in unsatisfactory
performance. In this work, we reformulate the cold-start item representation
learning from an information-theoretic standpoint. It aims to maximize the
mutual dependencies between item content and collaborative signals.
Specifically, the representation learning is theoretically lower-bounded by the
integration of two terms: mutual information between collaborative embeddings
of users and items, and mutual information between collaborative embeddings and
feature representations of items. To model such a learning process, we devise a
new objective function founded upon contrastive learning and develop a simple
yet effective Contrastive Learning-based Cold-start Recommendation
framework(CLCRec). In particular, CLCRec consists of three components:
contrastive pair organization, contrastive embedding, and contrastive
optimization modules. It allows us to preserve collaborative signals in the
content representations for both warm and cold-start items. Through extensive
experiments on four publicly accessible datasets, we observe that CLCRec
achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both
warm- and cold-start scenarios.]]></summary>

(RSSI)-based single-antenna localization (R-SAL) with decimeter-level
localization accuracy. To achieve decimeter-level accuracy, either fine-grained
radio frequency (RF) information (e.g., channel state information) or
coarse-grained RF information (e.g., RSSI) from more than multiple antennas is
required. Meanwhile, owing to deficiency of single-antenna RSSI which only
indicates a distance between a receiver and a transmitter, realizing
fine-grained localization accuracy with single coarse-grained RF information is
challenging. Our key idea to address this challenge is to leverage computer
vision (CV) and to estimate the most likely Fresnel zone between the receiver
and transmitter, where the role of RSSI is to detect blockage timings.
Specifically, historical positions of an obstacle that dynamically blocks the
Fresnel zone are detected by the CV technique, and we estimate positions at
which a blockage starts and ends via a time series of RSSI. These estimated
obstacle positions, in principle, coincide with points on the Fresnel zone
boundaries, enabling the estimation of the Fresnel zone and localization of the
transmitter. The experimental evaluation revealed that the proposed R-SAL
achieved decimeter-level localization in an indoor environment, which is
comparable to that of a simple previous RSSI-based localization with three
receivers.]]></summary>

able to understand rich video contents and perform spatial-temporal reasoning.
However, existing graph-based methods fail to perform multi-step reasoning
well, neglecting two properties of VideoQA: (1) Even for the same video,
different questions may require different amount of video clips or objects to
infer the answer with relational reasoning; (2) During reasoning, appearance
and motion features have complicated interdependence which are correlated and
complementary to each other. Based on these observations, we propose a
Dual-Visual Graph Reasoning Unit (DualVGR) which reasons over videos in an

features through multiple cycles of reasoning. The second contribution is the
proposed Video-based Multi-view Graph Attention Network, which captures the
relations between appearance and motion features. Our DualVGR network achieves

increasingly adopted as human-vehicle interaction methods. This technology
enables drivers to use voice commands to control the vehicle and will be soon
available in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Prior work has shown
that Siri, Alexa and Cortana, are highly vulnerable to inaudible command
attacks. This could be extended to ADAS in real-world applications and such
inaudible command threat is difficult to detect due to microphone
nonlinearities. In this paper, we aim to develop a more practical solution by
using camera views to defend against inaudible command attacks where ADAS are
capable of detecting their environment via multi-sensors. To this end, we
propose a novel multimodal deep learning classification system to defend
against inaudible command attacks. Our experimental results confirm the
feasibility of the proposed defense methods and the best classification

the real world. In this paper, we focus on adaptation to label distribution
shift in the online setting, where the test-time label distribution is
continually changing and the model must dynamically adapt to it without
observing the true label. Leveraging a novel analysis, we show that the lack of
true label does not hinder estimation of the expected test loss, which enables
the reduction of online label shift adaptation to conventional online learning.
Informed by this observation, we propose adaptation algorithms inspired by
classical online learning techniques such as Follow The Leader (FTL) and Online
Gradient Descent (OGD) and derive their regret bounds. We empirically verify
our findings under both simulated and real world label distribution shifts and
show that OGD is particularly effective and robust to a variety of challenging

with normalizing flows (NFs) for improved performance. This method transports a
set of particles using not only importance sampling (IS), Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) and resampling steps - as in SMC, but also relies on NFs which are
learned sequentially to push particles towards the successive annealed targets.
We provide limit theorems for the resulting Monte Carlo estimates of the
normalizing constant and expectations with respect to the target distribution.
Additionally, we show that a continuous-time scaling limit of the population
version of AFT is given by a Feynman--Kac measure which simplifies to the law
of a controlled diffusion for expressive NFs. We demonstrate experimentally the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There has been a long history of using ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
to understand the dynamics of discrete-time algorithms (DTAs). Surprisingly,
there are still two fundamental and unanswered questions: (i) it is unclear how
to obtain a \emph{suitable} ODE from a given DTA, and (ii) it is unclear the
connection between the convergence of a DTA and its corresponding ODEs. In this
paper, we propose a new machinery -- an $O(s^r)$-resolution ODE framework --
for analyzing the behavior of a generic DTA, which (partially) answers the
above two questions. The framework contains three steps: 1. To obtain a
suitable ODE from a given DTA, we define a hierarchy of $O(s^r)$-resolution
ODEs of a DTA parameterized by the degree $r$, where $s$ is the step-size of
the DTA. We present a principal approach to construct the unique
$O(s^r)$-resolution ODEs from a DTA; 2. To analyze the resulting ODE, we
propose the $O(s^r)$-linear-convergence condition of a DTA with respect to an
energy function, under which the $O(s^r)$-resolution ODE converges linearly to
an optimal solution; 3. To bridge the convergence properties of a DTA and its
corresponding ODEs, we define the properness of an energy function and show
that the linear convergence of the $O(s^r)$-resolution ODE with respect to a
proper energy function can automatically guarantee the linear convergence of
the DTA. To better illustrate this machinery, we utilize it to study three
classic algorithms -- gradient descent ascent (GDA), proximal point method
(PPM) and extra-gradient method (EGM) -- for solving the unconstrained minimax
problem $\min_{x\in\RR^n} \max_{y\in \RR^m} L(x,y)$.]]></summary>

sentencing, approving credit cards, hiring employees, and so on. Some of these
decisions show bias and adversely affect certain social groups (e.g. those
defined by sex, race, age, marital status). Many prior works on bias mitigation
take the following form: change the data or learners in multiple ways, then see
if any of that improves fairness. Perhaps a better approach is to postulate
root causes of bias and then applying some resolution strategy. This paper
postulates that the root causes of bias are the prior decisions that affect-
(a) what data was selected and (b) the labels assigned to those examples. Our
Fair-SMOTE algorithm removes biased labels; and rebalances internal
distributions such that based on sensitive attribute, examples are equal in
both positive and negative classes. On testing, it was seen that this method
was just as effective at reducing bias as prior approaches. Further, models
generated via Fair-SMOTE achieve higher performance (measured in terms of
recall and F1) than other state-of-the-art fairness improvement algorithms. To
the best of our knowledge, measured in terms of number of analyzed learners and
datasets, this study is one of the largest studies on bias mitigation yet
presented in the literature.]]></summary>

but relatively few works have studied bandits with non-concave reward. This
work considers a large family of bandit problems where the unknown underlying
reward function is non-concave, including the low-rank generalized linear
bandit problems and two-layer neural network with polynomial activation bandit
problem. For the low-rank generalized linear bandit problem, we provide a
minimax-optimal algorithm in the dimension, refuting both conjectures in
[LMT21, JWWN19]. Our algorithms are based on a unified zeroth-order
optimization paradigm that applies in great generality and attains optimal
rates in several structured polynomial settings (in the dimension). We further
demonstrate the applicability of our algorithms in RL in the generative model
setting, resulting in improved sample complexity over prior approaches.
Finally, we show that the standard optimistic algorithms (e.g., UCB) are
sub-optimal by dimension factors. In the neural net setting (with polynomial
activation functions) with noiseless reward, we provide a bandit algorithm with
sample complexity equal to the intrinsic algebraic dimension. Again, we show
that optimistic approaches have worse sample complexity, polynomial in the
extrinsic dimension (which could be exponentially worse in the polynomial
degree).]]></summary>

semantic descriptor, two spectral descriptors derived from predicted geometric
parameters, as well as an adjacency matrix that encodes sharp edges. Moreover,
instead of merely concatenating the descriptors, HPNet optimally combines
hybrid representations by learning combination weights. This weighting module
builds on the entropy of input features. The output primitive segmentation is

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Histopathology-based survival modelling has two major hurdles. Firstly, a
well-performing survival model has minimal clinical application if it does not
contribute to the stratification of a cancer patient cohort into different risk
groups, preferably driven by histologic morphologies. In the clinical setting,
individuals are not given specific prognostic predictions, but are rather
predicted to lie within a risk group which has a general survival trend. Thus,
It is imperative that a survival model produces well-stratified risk groups.
Secondly, until now, survival modelling was done in a two-stage approach
(encoding and aggregation). The massive amount of pixels in digitized whole
slide images were never utilized to their fullest extent due to technological
constraints on data processing, forcing decoupled learning. EPIC-Survival
bridges encoding and aggregation into an end-to-end survival modelling
approach, while introducing stratification boosting to encourage the model to
not only optimize ranking, but also to discriminate between risk groups. In
this study we show that EPIC-Survival performs better than other approaches in
modelling intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, a historically difficult cancer to
model. Further, we show that stratification boosting improves further improves
model performance, resulting in a concordance-index of 0.880 on a held-out test
set. Finally, we were able to identify specific histologic differences, not
commonly sought out in ICC, between low and high risk groups.]]></summary>

These data are often represented as networks, which are then explored with
approaches arising from network theory. Recent years have witnessed the
extension of network exploration methods to leverage more complex and richer
network frameworks. Random walks, for instance, have been extended to explore
multilayer networks. However, current random walk approaches are limited in the
combination and heterogeneity of network layers they can handle. New analytical
and numerical random walk methods are needed to cope with the increasing
diversity and complexity of multilayer networks. We propose here MultiXrank, a
Python package that enables Random Walk with Restart (RWR) on any kind of
multilayer network with an optimized implementation. This package is supported
by a universal mathematical formulation of the RWR. We evaluated MultiXrank
with leave-one-out cross-validation and link prediction, and introduced
protocols to measure the impact of the addition or removal of multilayer
network data on prediction performances. We further measured the sensitivity of
MultiXrank to input parameters by in-depth exploration of the parameter space.
Finally, we illustrate the versatility of MultiXrank with different use-cases
of unsupervised node prioritization and supervised classification in the
context of human genetic diseases.]]></summary>

visual effects of Graphical User Interface (GUI) that offers a bridge between
software applications and end-users. However, various types of graphical
glitches may arise from such GUI complexity and have become one of the main
component of software compatibility issues. Our study on bug reports from game
development teams in NetEase Inc. indicates that graphical glitches frequently
occur during the GUI rendering and severely degrade the quality of
graphically-rich applications such as video games. Existing automated testing
techniques for such applications focus mainly on generating various GUI test
sequences and check whether the test sequences can cause crashes. These
techniques require constant human attention to captures non-crashing bugs such
as bugs causing graphical glitches. In this paper, we present the first step in
automating the test oracle for detecting non-crashing bugs in graphically-rich
applications. Specifically, we propose \texttt{GLIB} based on a code-based data
augmentation technique to detect game GUI glitches. We perform an evaluation of
\texttt{GLIB} on 20 real-world game apps (with bug reports available) and the
result shows that \texttt{GLIB} can achieve 100\% precision and 99.5\% recall
in detecting non-crashing bugs such as game GUI glitches. Practical application
of \texttt{GLIB} on another 14 real-world games (without bug reports) further
demonstrates that \texttt{GLIB} can effectively uncover GUI glitches, with 48
of 53 bugs reported by \texttt{GLIB} having been confirmed and fixed so far.]]></summary>

necessitated by the large volumes of data they produce and growing concerns of
data privacy. However, there are three challenges that need to be addressed to
make FL efficient: (i) execute on devices with limited computational
capabilities, (ii) account for stragglers due to computational heterogeneity of
devices, and (iii) adapt to the changing network bandwidths. This paper
presents FedAdapt, an adaptive offloading FL framework to mitigate the
aforementioned challenges. FedAdapt accelerates local training in
computationally constrained devices by leveraging layer offloading of deep
neural networks (DNNs) to servers. Further, FedAdapt adopts reinforcement
learning-based optimization and clustering to adaptively identify which layers
of the DNN should be offloaded for each individual device on to a server to
tackle the challenges of computational heterogeneity and changing network
bandwidth. Experimental studies are carried out on a lab-based testbed
comprising five IoT devices. By offloading a DNN from the device to the server
FedAdapt reduces the training time of a typical IoT device by over half
compared to classic FL. The training time of extreme stragglers and the overall
training time can be reduced by up to 57%. Furthermore, with changing network
bandwidth, FedAdapt is demonstrated to reduce the training time by up to 40%
when compared to classic FL, without sacrificing accuracy. FedAdapt can be

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As technology scaling is approaching the physical limit, lithography hotspot
detection has become an essential task in design for manufacturability. While
the deployment of pattern matching or machine learning in hotspot detection can
help save significant simulation time, such methods typically demand for
non-trivial quality data to build the model, which most design houses are short
of. Moreover, the design houses are also unwilling to directly share such data
with the other houses to build a unified model, which can be ineffective for
the design house with unique design patterns due to data insufficiency. On the
other hand, with data homogeneity in each design house, the locally trained
models can be easily over-fitted, losing generalization ability and robustness.
In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous federated learning framework for
lithography hotspot detection that can address the aforementioned issues. On
one hand, the framework can build a more robust centralized global sub-model
through heterogeneous knowledge sharing while keeping local data private. On
the other hand, the global sub-model can be combined with a local sub-model to
better adapt to local data heterogeneity. The experimental results show that
the proposed framework can overcome the challenge of non-independent and
identically distributed (non-IID) data and heterogeneous communication to
achieve very high performance in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods
while guaranteeing a good convergence rate in various scenarios.]]></summary>

disorders. Recently, numerous data driven deep learning models have been
proposed for automatic sleep staging. They mainly rely on the assumption that
training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution which may not
hold in real-world scenarios. Unsupervised domain adaption (UDA) has been
recently developed to handle this domain shift problem. However, previous UDA
methods applied for sleep staging has two main limitations. First, they rely on
a totally shared model for the domain alignment, which may lose the
domain-specific information during feature extraction. Second, they only align
the source and target distributions globally without considering the class
information in the target domain, which hinders the classification performance
of the model. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial learning framework
to tackle the domain shift problem in the unlabeled target domain. First, we
develop unshared attention mechanisms to preserve the domain-specific features
in the source and target domains. Second, we design a self-training strategy to
align the fine-grained class distributions for the source and target domains
via target domain pseudo labels. We also propose dual distinct classifiers to
increase the robustness and quality of the pseudo labels. The experimental
results on six cross-domain scenarios validate the efficacy of our proposed
framework for sleep staging and its advantage over state-of-the-art UDA
methods.]]></summary>

modulating coarse layer feature maps of StyleGAN to produce desirable
caricature shape exaggerations. We first build a layer-mixed StyleGAN for
photo-to-caricature style conversion by swapping fine layers of the StyleGAN
for photos to the corresponding layers of the StyleGAN trained to generate

color stylization for a caricature but without shape exaggerations. We then
append shape exaggeration blocks to the coarse layers of the layer-mixed model
and train the blocks to create shape exaggerations while preserving the

(SOI) in 3D volumes by only annotating a single slice, (i.e. semi-automatic 3D
segmentation). We show that high accuracy can be achieved by simply propagating
the 2D slice segmentation with an affinity matrix between consecutive slices,
which can be learnt in a self-supervised manner, namely slice reconstruction.
Specifically, we compare the proposed framework, termed as Sli2Vol, with
supervised approaches and two other unsupervised/ self-supervised slice
registration approaches, on 8 public datasets (both CT and MRI scans), spanning
9 different SOIs. Without any parameter-tuning, the same model achieves
superior performance with Dice scores (0-100 scale) of over 80 for most of the
benchmarks, including the ones that are unseen during training. Our results
show generalizability of the proposed approach across data from different
machines and with different SOIs: a major use case of semi-automatic
segmentation methods where fully supervised approaches would normally struggle.

because their message is derived from both text- and visual-modalities. To this
effect, Facebook released the Hateful Memes Challenge, a dataset of memes with
pre-extracted text captions, but it is unclear whether these synthetic examples
generalize to `memes in the wild'. In this paper, we collect hateful and
non-hateful memes from Pinterest to evaluate out-of-sample performance on
models pre-trained on the Facebook dataset. We find that memes in the wild
differ in two key aspects: 1) Captions must be extracted via OCR, injecting
noise and diminishing performance of multimodal models, and 2) Memes are more
diverse than `traditional memes', including screenshots of conversations or
text on a plain background. This paper thus serves as a reality check for the
current benchmark of hateful meme detection and its applicability for detecting

for drug discovery, yielding promising results in molecular design, chemical

limited due to their lack of interpretability. Although this major weakness has
been mitigated by the development of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
techniques, the "ground truth" assignment in most explainable tasks ultimately
rests with subjective judgments by humans so that the quality of model
interpretation is hard to evaluate in quantity. In this work, we first build
three levels of benchmark datasets to quantitatively assess the
interpretability of the state-of-the-art GNN models. Then we implemented recent
XAI methods in combination with different GNN algorithms to highlight the
benefits, limitations, and future opportunities for drug discovery. As a
result, GradInput and IG generally provide the best model interpretability for
GNNs, especially when combined with GraphNet and CMPNN. The integrated and
developed XAI package is fully open-sourced and can be used by practitioners to

(SOI) in 3D volumes by only annotating a single slice, (i.e. semi-automatic 3D
segmentation). We show that high accuracy can be achieved by simply propagating
the 2D slice segmentation with an affinity matrix between consecutive slices,
which can be learnt in a self-supervised manner, namely slice reconstruction.
Specifically, we compare the proposed framework, termed as Sli2Vol, with
supervised approaches and two other unsupervised/ self-supervised slice
registration approaches, on 8 public datasets (both CT and MRI scans), spanning
9 different SOIs. Without any parameter-tuning, the same model achieves
superior performance with Dice scores (0-100 scale) of over 80 for most of the
benchmarks, including the ones that are unseen during training. Our results
show generalizability of the proposed approach across data from different
machines and with different SOIs: a major use case of semi-automatic
segmentation methods where fully supervised approaches would normally struggle.

machine learning models. However, it is not well understood how to design the
collaborative process so as to maximize the combined moderator-model system
performance. This work presents a rigorous study of this problem, focusing on
an approach that incorporates model uncertainty into the collaborative process.
First, we introduce principled metrics to describe the performance of the
collaborative system under capacity constraints on the human moderator,
quantifying how efficiently the combined system utilizes human decisions. Using
these metrics, we conduct a large benchmark study evaluating the performance of
state-of-the-art uncertainty models under different collaborative review
strategies. We find that an uncertainty-based strategy consistently outperforms
the widely used strategy based on toxicity scores, and moreover that the choice
of review strategy drastically changes the overall system performance. Our
results demonstrate the importance of rigorous metrics for understanding and
developing effective moderator-model systems for content moderation, as well as
the utility of uncertainty estimation in this domain.]]></summary>

policies for a variety of tasks. However, these neural network-based policies
have been shown to be susceptible to exploitation by adversarial agents.
Therefore, there is a need to develop techniques to learn control policies that
are robust against adversaries. We introduce Adversarially Robust Control
(ARC), which trains the protagonist policy and the adversarial policy
end-to-end on the same loss. The aim of the protagonist is to maximise this
loss, whilst the adversary is attempting to minimise it. We demonstrate the
proposed ARC training in a highway driving scenario, where the protagonist
controls the follower vehicle whilst the adversary controls the lead vehicle.
By training the protagonist against an ensemble of adversaries, it learns a
significantly more robust control policy, which generalises to a variety of
adversarial strategies. The approach is shown to reduce the amount of
collisions against new adversaries by up to 90.25%, compared to the original
policy. Moreover, by utilising an auxiliary distillation loss, we show that the
fine-tuned control policy shows no drop in performance across its original
training distribution.]]></summary>

interfering ones in a multi-speaker scenario. It has been recently shown that
we can quantitatively evaluate the segregation capability by modelling the
relationship between the speech signals present in an auditory scene and the
cortical signals of the listener measured using electroencephalography (EEG).
This has opened up avenues to integrate neuro-feedback into hearing aids
whereby the device can infer user's attention and enhance the attended speaker.
Commonly used algorithms to infer the auditory attention are based on linear
systems theory where the speech cues such as envelopes are mapped on to the EEG
signals. Here, we present a joint convolutional neural network (CNN) - long
short-term memory (LSTM) model to infer the auditory attention. Our joint
CNN-LSTM model takes the EEG signals and the spectrogram of the multiple
speakers as inputs and classifies the attention to one of the speakers. We
evaluated the reliability of our neural network using three different datasets
comprising of 61 subjects where, each subject undertook a dual-speaker
experiment. The three datasets analysed corresponded to speech stimuli
presented in three different languages namely German, Danish and Dutch. Using
the proposed joint CNN-LSTM model, we obtained a median decoding accuracy of
77.2% at a trial duration of three seconds. Furthermore, we evaluated the
amount of sparsity that our model can tolerate by means of magnitude pruning
and found that the model can tolerate up to 50% sparsity without substantial
loss of decoding accuracy.]]></summary>

stochastic dynamical systems, whose theoretical properties have been well
studied in machine learning and statistics communities. In many control
problems, e.g., partially observed linear dynamical systems (POLDS), oftentimes
the inferred latent state is further used for planning at each step. This paper
initiates a rigorous study on the efficiency of particle filtering for
sequential planning, and gives the first particle complexity bounds. Though
errors in past actions may affect the future, we are able to bound the number
of particles needed so that the long-run reward of the policy based on particle
filtering is close to that based on exact inference. In particular, we show
that, in stable systems, polynomially many particles suffice. Key in our proof
is a coupling of the ideal sequence based on the exact planning and the
sequence generated by approximate planning based on particle filtering. We
believe this technique can be useful in other sequential decision-making
problems.]]></summary>

representations: surface representation, structure representation, and texture

images. The structure representation relates to the sparse colour blocks and
compresses generic content. The texture representation shows the texture,
curves, and features in cartoon images. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
framework decomposes the images into different representations and learns from
them to generate cartoon images. This decomposition makes the framework more
controllable and flexible which allows users to make changes based on the
required output. This approach overcomes any previous system in terms of

certification of deep neural network classifiers at scale. All prior art on
randomized smoothing has focused on isotropic $\ell_p$ certification, which has
the advantage of yielding certificates that can be easily compared among
isotropic methods via $\ell_p$-norm radius. However, isotropic certification
limits the region that can be certified around an input to worst-case
adversaries, \ie it cannot reason about other "close", potentially large,
constant prediction safe regions. To alleviate this issue, (i) we theoretically
extend the isotropic randomized smoothing $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ certificates to
their generalized anisotropic counterparts following a simplified analysis.
Moreover, (ii) we propose evaluation metrics allowing for the comparison of
general certificates - a certificate is superior to another if it certifies a
superset region - with the quantification of each certificate through the
volume of the certified region. We introduce ANCER, a practical framework for
obtaining anisotropic certificates for a given test set sample via volume
maximization. Our empirical results demonstrate that ANCER achieves

in machine learning. This has been addressed using many deep and non-deep
learning based methods. Among the methodologies used, that of adversarial
learning is widely applied to solve many deep learning problems along with
domain adaptation. These methods are based on a discriminator that ensures
source and target distributions are close. However, here we suggest that rather
than using a point estimate obtaining by a single discriminator, it would be
useful if a distribution based on ensembles of discriminators could be used to
bridge this gap. This could be achieved using multiple classifiers or using
traditional ensemble methods. In contrast, we suggest that a Monte Carlo
dropout based ensemble discriminator could suffice to obtain the distribution
based discriminator. Specifically, we propose a curriculum based dropout
discriminator that gradually increases the variance of the sample based
distribution and the corresponding reverse gradients are used to align the
source and target feature representations. An ensemble of discriminators helps
the model to learn the data distribution efficiently. It also provides a better
gradient estimates to train the feature extractor. The detailed results and
thorough ablation analysis show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art

with recent works performing it as a semantic segmentation task over document
images using fully-convolution networks. Such methods are limited by image
resolution due to which they fail to disambiguate structures in dense regions
which appear commonly in forms. To mitigate this, we propose Form2Seq, a novel
sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) inspired framework for structure extraction
using text, with a specific focus on forms, which leverages relative spatial
arrangement of structures. We discuss two tasks; 1) Classification of low-level
constituent elements (TextBlock and empty fillable Widget) into ten types such
as field captions, list items, and others; 2) Grouping lower-level elements
into higher-order constructs, such as Text Fields, ChoiceFields and
ChoiceGroups, used as information collection mechanism in forms. To achieve
this, we arrange the constituent elements linearly in natural reading order,
feed their spatial and textual representations to Seq2Seq framework, which
sequentially outputs prediction of each element depending on the final task. We
modify Seq2Seq for grouping task and discuss improvements obtained through
cascaded end-to-end training of two tasks versus training in isolation.
Experimental results show the effectiveness of our text-based approach
achieving an accuracy of 90% on classification task and an F1 of 75.82, 86.01,
61.63 on groups discussed above respectively, outperforming segmentation
baselines. Further we show our framework achieves state of the results for

risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) context. The objective of our
algorithm is to maximize the distorted risk measure (DRM) of the cumulative
reward in an episodic Markov decision process (MDP). We derive a variant of the
policy gradient theorem that caters to the DRM objective. Using this theorem in
conjunction with a likelihood ratio (LR) based gradient estimation scheme, we
propose policy gradient algorithms for optimizing DRM in both on-policy and

better at mastering a predefined set of tasks. On the other hand, as humans, we
have the ability to learn a growing set of tasks over our lifetime. Continual
robot learning is an emerging research direction with the goal of endowing
robots with this ability. In order to learn new tasks over time, the robot
first needs to infer the task at hand. Task inference, however, has received
little attention in the multi-task learning literature. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach to continual learning of robotic control tasks. Our
approach performs unsupervised learning of behavior embeddings by incrementally
self-organizing demonstrated behaviors. Task inference is made by finding the
nearest behavior embedding to a demonstrated behavior, which is used together
with the environment state as input to a multi-task policy trained with
reinforcement learning to optimize performance over tasks. Unlike previous
approaches, our approach makes no assumptions about task distribution and
requires no task exploration to infer tasks. We evaluate our approach in
experiments with concurrently and sequentially presented tasks and show that it
outperforms other multi-task learning approaches in terms of generalization
performance and convergence speed, particularly in the continual learning
setting.]]></summary>

detection, segmentation, and tracking simultaneously. Extended from image set
applications, video data additionally induces the temporal information, which,
if handled appropriately, is very useful to identify and predict object
motions. In this work, we design a unified model to mutually learn these tasks.
Specifically, we propose two modules, named Temporally Correlated Instance
Segmentation (TCIS) and Bidirectional Tracking (BiTrack), to take the benefit
of the temporal correlation between the object's instance masks across adjacent
frames. On the other hand, video data is often redundant due to the frame's
overlap. Our analysis shows that this problem is particularly severe for the
YoutubeVOS-VIS2021 data. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Source Data (MSD)
training mechanism to compensate for the data deficiency. By combining these
techniques with a bag of tricks, the network performance is significantly
boosted compared to the baseline, and outperforms other methods by a
considerable margin on the YoutubeVOS-VIS 2019 and 2021 datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metric-based few-shot fine-grained image classification (FSFGIC) aims to
learn a transferable feature embedding network by estimating the similarities
between query images and support classes from very few examples. In this work,
we propose, for the first time, to introduce the non-linear data projection
concept into the design of FSFGIC architecture in order to address the limited
sample problem in few-shot learning and at the same time to increase the
discriminability of the model for fine-grained image classification.
Specifically, we first design a feature re-abstraction embedding network that
has the ability to not only obtain the required semantic features for effective
metric learning but also re-enhance such features with finer details from input
images. Then the descriptors of the query images and the support classes are
projected into different non-linear spaces in our proposed similarity metric
learning network to learn discriminative projection factors. This design can
effectively operate in the challenging and restricted condition of a FSFGIC
task for making the distance between the samples within the same class smaller
and the distance between samples from different classes larger and for reducing
the coupling relationship between samples from different categories.
Furthermore, a novel similarity measure based on the proposed non-linear data
project is presented for evaluating the relationships of feature information
between a query image and a support set. It is worth to note that our proposed
architecture can be easily embedded into any episodic training mechanisms for
end-to-end training from scratch. Extensive experiments on FSFGIC tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-art
benchmarks.]]></summary>

a rich body of research concerned with hardwareaccelerators for
compute-intensive DNN operators. However, implementing such operators
efficiently with complex hardwareintrinsics such as matrix multiply is a task
not yet automated gracefully. Solving this task often requires joint program
and data layouttransformations. First solutions to this problem have been
proposed, such as TVM, UNIT or ISAMIR, which work on a loop-levelrepresentation
of operators and specify data layout and possible program transformations
before the embedding into the operator isperformed. This top-down approach
creates a tension between exploration range and search space complexity,
especially when alsoexploring data layout transformations such as im2col,
channel packing or padding.In this work, we propose a new approach to this
problem. We created a bottom-up method that allows the joint transformation
ofboth compuation and data layout based on the found embedding. By formulating
the embedding as a constraint satisfaction problemover the scalar dataflow,
every possible embedding solution is contained in the search space. Adding
additional constraints andoptmization targets to the solver generates the
subset of preferable solutions.An evaluation using the VTA hardware accelerator
with the Baidu DeepBench inference benchmark shows that our approach
canautomatically generate code competitive to reference implementations.
Further, we show that dynamically determining the data layoutbased on intrinsic
and workload is beneficial for hardware utilization and performance. In cases
where the reference implementationhas low hardware utilization due to its fixed
deployment strategy, we achieve a geomean speedup of up to x2.813, while
individualoperators can improve as much as x170.]]></summary>

allow a pre-trained model in the source domain to be effectively adapted to
downstream tasks in the target domain. It is thus important to explore and
understand the factors affecting knowledge transferability. In this paper, as
the first work, we analyze and demonstrate the connections between knowledge
transferability and another important phenomenon--adversarial transferability,
\emph{i.e.}, adversarial examples generated against one model can be
transferred to attack other models. Our theoretical studies show that
adversarial transferability indicates knowledge transferability and vice versa.
Moreover, based on the theoretical insights, we propose two practical
adversarial transferability metrics to characterize this process, serving as
bidirectional indicators between adversarial and knowledge transferability. We
conduct extensive experiments for different scenarios on diverse datasets,
showing a positive correlation between adversarial transferability and
knowledge transferability. Our findings will shed light on future research
about effective knowledge transfer learning and adversarial transferability

generates a strong demand for explanations that are robust to noise and align
well with human intuition. Most existing methods generate explanations by
identifying a subgraph of an input graph that has a strong correlation with the
prediction. These explanations are not robust to noise because independently
optimizing the correlation for a single input can easily overfit noise.
Moreover, they do not align well with human intuition because removing an
identified subgraph from an input graph does not necessarily change the
prediction result. In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate robust
counterfactual explanations on GNNs by explicitly modelling the common decision
logic of GNNs on similar input graphs. Our explanations are naturally robust to
noise because they are produced from the common decision boundaries of a GNN
that govern the predictions of many similar input graphs. The explanations also
align well with human intuition because removing the set of edges identified by
an explanation from the input graph changes the prediction significantly.
Exhaustive experiments on many public datasets demonstrate the superior

this study, we proceeded to build a tracheal sound database, HF_Tracheal_V1,

HF_Tracheal_V1 and the lung sound in HF_Lung_V2 were either combined or used
alone to train the CNN-BiGRU models for respective lung and tracheal sound
analysis. Different training strategies were investigated and compared: (1)
using full training (training from scratch) to train the lung sound models
using lung sound alone and train the tracheal sound models using tracheal sound
alone, (2) using a mixed set that contains both the lung and tracheal sound to
train the models, and (3) using domain adaptation that finetuned the
pre-trained lung sound models with the tracheal sound data and vice versa.
Results showed that the models trained only by lung sound performed poorly in
the tracheal sound analysis and vice versa. However, the mixed set training and
domain adaptation can improve the performance of exhalation and CAS detection
in the lung sound, and inhalation, exhalation, and CAS detection in the

imaging have been limited to uniform domains, such as pixelated images. If the
underlying model is solved on nonuniform meshes, arising from a finite element
method typical for nonlinear inverse problems, interpolation and embeddings are
needed. To overcome this, we present a flexible framework to extend model-based
learning directly to nonuniform meshes, by interpreting the mesh as a graph and
formulating our network architectures using graph convolutional neural
networks. This gives rise to the proposed iterative Graph Convolutional
Newton-type Method (GCNM), which includes the forward model in the solution of
the inverse problem, while all updates are directly computed by the network on
the problem specific mesh. We present results for Electrical Impedance
Tomography, a severely ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem that is frequently
solved via optimization-based methods, where the forward problem is solved by
finite element methods. Results for absolute EIT imaging are compared to
standard iterative methods as well as a graph residual network. We show that
the GCNM has strong generalizability to different domain shapes and meshes, out

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fisher information matrix (FIM) has been applied to the realm of deep
learning. It is closely related to the loss landscape, the variance of the
parameters, second order optimization, and deep learning theory. The exact FIM
is either unavailable in closed form or too expensive to compute. In practice,
it is almost always estimated based on empirical samples. We investigate two
such estimators based on two equivalent representations of the FIM. They are
both unbiased and consistent with respect to the underlying "true" FIM. Their
estimation quality is characterized by their variance given in closed form. We
bound their variances and analyze how the parametric structure of a deep neural
network can impact the variance. We discuss the meaning of this variance
measure and our bounds in the context of deep learning.]]></summary>

caused widespread economic and social impact worldwide. Across the globe,
governments have put mandates for the use of face masks, which have received
both positive and negative reaction. Online social media provides an exciting
platform to study the use of masks and analyze underlying mask-wearing
patterns. In this article, we analyze 2.04 million social media images for six
US cities. An increase in masks worn in images is seen as the COVID-19 cases
rose, particularly when their respective states imposed strict regulations. We
also found a decrease in the posting of group pictures as stay-at-home laws
were put into place. Furthermore, mask compliance in the Black Lives Matter
protest was analyzed, eliciting that 40% of the people in group photos wore
masks, and 45% of them wore the masks with a fit score of greater than 80%. We
introduce two new datasets, VAriety MAsks - Classification (VAMA-C) and VAriety
MAsks - Segmentation (VAMA-S), for mask detection and mask fit analysis tasks,
respectively. For the analysis, we create two frameworks, face mask detector
(for classifying masked and unmasked faces) and mask fit analyzer (a semantic
segmentation based model to calculate a mask-fit score). The face mask detector
achieved a classification accuracy of 98%, and the semantic segmentation model
for the mask fit analyzer achieved an Intersection Over Union (IOU) score of
98%. We conclude that such a framework can be used to evaluate the
effectiveness of such public health strategies using social media platforms in
times of pandemic.]]></summary>

depth maps of the target views by using adaptive depth scaling, while the
latter one leverages the predicted depths and renders spatially and temporally

RGBD-Net not only outperforms the state-of-the-art by a clear margin, but it
also generalizes well to new scenes without per-scene optimization. Moreover,
we show that RGBD-Net can be optionally trained without depth supervision while
still retaining high-quality rendering. Thanks to the depth regression network,
RGBD-Net can be also used for creating dense 3D point clouds that are more
accurate than those produced by some state-of-the-art multi-view stereo

this paper, we present hierarchical contrastive motion learning, a new
self-supervised learning framework to extract effective motion representations
from raw video frames. Our approach progressively learns a hierarchy of motion
features that correspond to different abstraction levels in a network. This
hierarchical design bridges the semantic gap between low-level motion cues and
high-level recognition tasks, and promotes the fusion of appearance and motion
information at multiple levels. At each level, an explicit motion
self-supervision is provided via contrastive learning to enforce the motion
features at the current level to predict the future ones at the previous level.
Thus, the motion features at higher levels are trained to gradually capture
semantic dynamics and evolve more discriminative for action recognition. Our
motion learning module is lightweight and flexible to be embedded into various
backbone networks. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that the
proposed approach consistently achieves superior results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a prevalent imaging technique for
retina. However, it is affected by multiplicative speckle noise that can
degrade the visibility of essential anatomical structures, including blood
vessels and tissue layers. Although averaging repeated B-scan frames can
significantly improve the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), this requires longer
acquisition time, which can introduce motion artifacts and cause discomfort to
patients. In this study, we propose a learning-based method that exploits
information from the single-frame noisy B-scan and a pseudo-modality that is
created with the aid of the self-fusion method. The pseudo-modality provides
good SNR for layers that are barely perceptible in the noisy B-scan but can
over-smooth fine features such as small vessels. By using a fusion network,
desired features from each modality can be combined, and the weight of their
contribution is adjustable. Evaluated by intensity-based and structural
metrics, the result shows that our method can effectively suppress the speckle
noise and enhance the contrast between retina layers while the overall
structure and small blood vessels are preserved. Compared to the single
modality network, our method improves the structural similarity with low noise
B-scan from 0.559 +\- 0.033 to 0.576 +\- 0.031.]]></summary>

Many efficient search techniques rely on the triangle inequality of metrics,
which allows pruning parts of the search space based on transitive bounds on
distances. Recently, Cosine similarity has become a popular alternative choice
to the standard Euclidean metric, in particular in the context of textual data
and neural network embeddings. Unfortunately, Cosine similarity is not metric
and does not satisfy the standard triangle inequality. Instead, many search
techniques for Cosine rely on approximation techniques such as locality
sensitive hashing. In this paper, we derive a triangle inequality for Cosine
similarity that is suitable for efficient similarity search with many standard
search structures (such as the VP-tree, Cover-tree, and M-tree); show that this
bound is tight and discuss fast approximations for it. We hope that this spurs
new research on accelerating exact similarity search for cosine similarity, and
possible other similarity measures beyond the existing work for distance
metrics.]]></summary>

larger graph via integrating the smaller ones. The integration requires
predicting hidden relational connections between entities belonged to different

existing methods that are exclusively designed for link prediction between

revenue management and online advertising. In these problems, requests arrive
sequentially during a finite horizon and, for each request, a decision maker
needs to choose an action that consumes a certain amount of resources and
generates reward. The objective is to maximize cumulative rewards subject to a
constraint on the total consumption of resources. In this paper, we consider a
data-driven setting in which the reward and resource consumption of each
request are generated using an input model that is unknown to the decision
maker.

We design a general class of algorithms that attain good performance in
various inputs models without knowing which type of input they are facing. In
particular, our algorithms are asymptotically optimal under stochastic i.i.d.
input model as well as various non-stationary stochastic input models, and they
attain an asymptotically optimal fixed competitive ratio when the input is
adversarial. Our algorithms operate in the Lagrangian dual space: they maintain
a dual multiplier for each resource that is updated using online mirror
descent. By choosing the reference function accordingly, we recover dual
sub-gradient descent and dual exponential weights algorithm. The resulting
algorithms are simple, fast, and have minimal requirements on the reward
functions, consumption functions and the action space, in contrast to existing
methods for online allocation problems. We discuss applications to network
revenue management, online bidding in repeated auctions with budget
constraints, online proportional matching with high entropy, and personalized

source domains to facilitate the learning in a target domain. It is
particularly useful when the target domain has few or no labeled data, due to
annotation expense, privacy concerns, etc. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of
TL is not always guaranteed. Negative transfer (NT), i.e., the source domain
data/knowledge cause reduced learning performance in the target domain, has
been a long-standing and challenging problem in TL. Various approaches to
handle NT have been proposed in the literature. However, this filed lacks a
systematic survey on the formalization of NT, their factors and the algorithms
that handle NT. This paper proposes to fill this gap. First, the definition of
negative transfer is considered and a taxonomy of the factors are discussed.
Then, near fifty representative approaches for handling NT are categorized and
reviewed, from four perspectives: secure transfer, domain similarity
estimation, distant transfer and negative transfer mitigation. NT in related
fields, e.g., multi-task learning, lifelong learning, and adversarial attacks
are also discussed.]]></summary>

design patterns across different architectural depths through the lens of
OpenVINO microprocessor-specific and GPU-specific acceleration. Experimental
results showed that while leveraging hardware-specific acceleration achieved an
average inference speed-up of 380%, the degree of inference speed-up varied
drastically depending on the macro-architecture design pattern, with the
greatest speedup achieved on the depthwise bottleneck convolution design
pattern at 550%. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth exploration of the
correlation between FLOPs requirement, level 3 cache efficacy, and network
latency with increasing architectural depth and width. Finally, we analyze the
inference time reductions using hardware-specific acceleration when compared to
native deep learning frameworks across a wide variety of hand-crafted deep

Current approaches for generative modeling have typically been limited to
conventional image datasets and performed in the pixel domain which do not
explicitly capture the correlation between pixels. Additionally, these
approaches do not extend to scientific and other applications where each
element value is continuous and is not limited to a fixed range. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach for generating two-dimensional datasets by moving
the computations to the space of representation bases and show its usefulness
for two different datasets, one from imaging and another from scientific
computing. The proposed approach is general and can be applied to any dataset,
representation basis, or generative model. We provide a comprehensive
performance comparison of various combinations of generative models and
representation basis spaces. We also propose a new evaluation metric which
captures the deficiency of generating images in pixel space.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data-to-Text Generation (DTG) is a subfield of Natural Language Generation
aiming at transcribing structured data in natural language descriptions. The
field has been recently boosted by the use of neural-based generators which
exhibit on one side great syntactic skills without the need of hand-crafted
pipelines; on the other side, the quality of the generated text reflects the
quality of the training data, which in realistic settings only offer
imperfectly aligned structure-text pairs. Consequently, state-of-art neural
models include misleading statements - usually called hallucinations - in their
outputs. The control of this phenomenon is today a major challenge for DTG, and
is the problem addressed in the paper.

Previous work deal with this issue at the instance level: using an alignment
score for each table-reference pair. In contrast, we propose a finer-grained
approach, arguing that hallucinations should rather be treated at the word
level. Specifically, we propose a Multi-Branch Decoder which is able to
leverage word-level labels to learn the relevant parts of each training
instance. These labels are obtained following a simple and efficient scoring
procedure based on co-occurrence analysis and dependency parsing. Extensive
evaluations, via automated metrics and human judgment on the standard WikiBio
benchmark, show the accuracy of our alignment labels and the effectiveness of
the proposed Multi-Branch Decoder. Our model is able to reduce and control
hallucinations, while keeping fluency and coherence in generated texts. Further
experiments on a degraded version of ToTTo show that our model could be
successfully used on very noisy settings.]]></summary>

under the assumption that the optimal value function lies close to the span of
a feature map. The generative model provides a local access to the MDP: The
planner can ask for random transitions from previously returned states and
arbitrary actions, and features are only accessible for states that are
encountered in this process. As opposed to previous work (e.g. Lattimore et al.
(2020)) where linear realizability of all policies was assumed, we consider the
significantly relaxed assumption of a single linearly realizable
(deterministic) policy. A recent lower bound by Weisz et al. (2020) established
that the related problem when the action-value function of the optimal policy
is linearly realizable requires an exponential number of queries, either in $H$
(the horizon of the MDP) or $d$ (the dimension of the feature mapping). Their
construction crucially relies on having an exponentially large action set. In
contrast, in this work, we establish that poly$(H,d)$ planning is possible with
state value function realizability whenever the action set has a constant size.
In particular, we present the TensorPlan algorithm which uses
poly$((dH/\delta)^A)$ simulator queries to find a $\delta$-optimal policy
relative to any deterministic policy for which the value function is linearly
realizable with some bounded parameter. This is the first algorithm to give a
polynomial query complexity guarantee using only linear-realizability of a
single competing value function. Whether the computation cost is similarly
bounded remains an open question. We extend the upper bound to the
near-realizable case and to the infinite-horizon discounted setup. We also
present a lower bound in the infinite-horizon episodic setting: Planners that
achieve constant suboptimality need exponentially many queries, either in $d$
or the number of actions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Boosting techniques and neural networks are particularly effective machine
learning methods for insurance pricing. Often in practice, there are
nevertheless endless debates about the choice of the right loss function to be
used to train the machine learning model, as well as about the appropriate
metric to assess the performances of competing models. Also, the sum of fitted
values can depart from the observed totals to a large extent and this often
confuses actuarial analysts. The lack of balance inherent to training models by
minimizing deviance outside the familiar GLM with canonical link setting has
been empirically documented in W\"uthrich (2019, 2020) who attributes it to the
early stopping rule in gradient descent methods for model fitting. The present
paper aims to further study this phenomenon when learning proceeds by
minimizing Tweedie deviance. It is shown that minimizing deviance involves a
trade-off between the integral of weighted differences of lower partial moments
and the bias measured on a specific scale. Autocalibration is then proposed as
a remedy. This new method to correct for bias adds an extra local GLM step to
the analysis. Theoretically, it is shown that it implements the autocalibration
concept in pure premium calculation and ensures that balance also holds on a
local scale, not only at portfolio level as with existing bias-correction
techniques. The convex order appears to be the natural tool to compare
competing models, putting a new light on the diagnostic graphs and associated
metrics proposed by Denuit et al. (2019).]]></summary>

sense become commonplace. Still, a "thorn in the side" of the deep learning
movement is the argument that deep networks are prone to overfitting and are
thus unable to generalize well when datasets are small (as is common in medical
imaging tasks). One way to bolster confidence is to provide mathematical
guarantees, or bounds, on network performance after training which explicitly
quantify the possibility of overfitting. In this work, we explore recent
advances using the PAC-Bayesian framework to provide bounds on generalization
error for large (stochastic) networks. While previous efforts focus on
classification in larger natural image datasets (e.g., MNIST and CIFAR-10), we
apply these techniques to both classification and segmentation in a smaller
medical imagining dataset: the ISIC 2018 challenge set. We observe the
resultant bounds are competitive compared to a simpler baseline, while also
being more explainable and alleviating the need for holdout sets.]]></summary>

recently the interaction with machine learning has attracted a growing

nonlinear stochastic approximation (SA) algorithm under Markovian noise, and
establish its finite-sample convergence bounds under various stepsizes.
Specifically, we show that when using constant stepsize (i.e.,
$\epsilon_k\equiv \epsilon$), the algorithm achieves exponential fast
convergence with asymptotic accuracy $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon\log(1/\epsilon))$.
When using diminishing stepsizes with appropriate decay rate, the algorithm
converges with rate $\mathcal{O}(\log(k)/k)$. Our proof is based on the
Lyapunov drift arguments, and to handle the Markovian noise, we exploit the
fast mixing of the underlying Markov chain. To demonstrate the generality of
our theoretical results on Markovian SA, we use it to derive the finite-sample
bounds of the popular $Q$-learning with linear function approximation
algorithm, under a condition on the behavior policy. Importantly, we do not
need to make the unrealistic assumption that the samples are i.i.d., and do not
require an additional projection step in the algorithm to maintain the
boundedness of the iterates. Numerical simulations corroborate our theoretical
findings.]]></summary>

a challenge to identify the individuals at risk of dementia for precise
management. Brain MRI offers a noninvasive biomarker to detect brain aging.
Previous evidence shows that the brain structural change detected by diffusion
MRI is associated with dementia. Mounting studies has conceptualised the brain
as a complex network, which has shown the utility of this approach in
characterising various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Therefore, the
structural connectivity shows promise in dementia classification. The proposed
BrainNetGAN is a generative adversarial network variant to augment the brain
structural connectivity matrices for binary dementia classification tasks.
Structural connectivity matrices between separated brain regions are
constructed using tractography on diffusion MRI data. The BrainNetGAN model is
trained to generate fake brain connectivity matrices, which are expected to
reflect latent distribution of the real brain network data. Finally, a
convolutional neural network classifier is proposed for binary dementia
classification. Numerical results show that the binary classification
performance in the testing set was improved using the BrainNetGAN augmented

rising scalability and privacy concerns on approaches based exclusively on
remote cloud platforms. Data gravity, a fundamental concept in Fog Computing,
points towards decentralisation of computation for data analysis, as a viable
alternative to address those concerns. Decentralising AI tasks on several
cooperative devices means identifying the optimal set of locations or
Collection Points (CP for short) to use, in the continuum between full
centralisation (i.e., all data on a single device) and full decentralisation
(i.e., data on source locations). We propose an analytical framework able to
find the optimal operating point in this continuum, linking the accuracy of the
learning task with the corresponding network and computational cost for moving
data and running the distributed training at the CPs. We show through
simulations that the model accurately predicts the optimal trade-off, quite
often an intermediate point between full centralisation and full
decentralisation, showing also a significant cost saving w.r.t. both of them.
Finally, the analytical model admits closed-form or numeric solutions, making
it not only a performance evaluation instrument but also a design tool to
configure a given distributed learning task optimally before its deployment.]]></summary>

is an effective and efficient way to mitigate the enormous costs and time of
the drug discovery process. Structure-based drug similarities and
sequence-based target protein similarities are the commonly used information
for DTI prediction. Among numerous computational methods, neighborhood-based
chemogenomic approaches that leverage drug and target similarities to perform
predictions directly are simple but promising ones. However, existing
similarity-based methods need to be re-trained to predict interactions for any
new drugs or targets and cannot directly perform predictions for both new
drugs, new targets, and new drug-target pairs. Furthermore, a large amount of
missing (undetected) interactions in current DTI datasets hinders most DTI
prediction methods. To address these issues, we propose a new method denoted as
Weighted k-Nearest Neighbor with Interaction Recovery (WkNNIR). Not only can
WkNNIR estimate interactions of any new drugs and/or new targets without any
need of re-training, but it can also recover missing interactions (false
negatives). In addition, WkNNIR exploits local imbalance to promote the
influence of more reliable similarities on the interaction recovery and
prediction processes. We also propose a series of ensemble methods that employ
diverse sampling strategies and could be coupled with WkNNIR as well as any
other DTI prediction method to improve performance. Experimental results over
five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in
predicting drug-target interactions. Lastly, we confirm the practical
prediction ability of proposed methods to discover reliable interactions that
were not reported in the original benchmark datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the challenges in a task oriented natural language application like
the Google Assistant, Siri, or Alexa is to localize the output to many
languages. This paper explores doing this by applying machine translation to
the English output. Using machine translation is very scalable, as it can work
with any English output and can handle dynamic text, but otherwise the problem
is a poor fit. The required quality bar is close to perfection, the range of
sentences is extremely narrow, and the sentences are often very different than
the ones in the machine translation training data. This combination of
requirements is novel in the field of domain adaptation for machine
translation. We are able to reach the required quality bar by building on
existing ideas and adding new ones: finetuning on in-domain translations,
adding sentences from the Web, adding semantic annotations, and using automatic
error detection. The paper shares our approach and results, together with a
distillation model to serve the translation models at scale.]]></summary>

visual effects of Graphical User Interface (GUI) that offers a bridge between
software applications and end-users. However, various types of graphical
glitches may arise from such GUI complexity and have become one of the main
component of software compatibility issues. Our study on bug reports from game
development teams in NetEase Inc. indicates that graphical glitches frequently
occur during the GUI rendering and severely degrade the quality of
graphically-rich applications such as video games. Existing automated testing
techniques for such applications focus mainly on generating various GUI test
sequences and check whether the test sequences can cause crashes. These
techniques require constant human attention to captures non-crashing bugs such
as bugs causing graphical glitches. In this paper, we present the first step in
automating the test oracle for detecting non-crashing bugs in graphically-rich
applications. Specifically, we propose \texttt{GLIB} based on a code-based data
augmentation technique to detect game GUI glitches. We perform an evaluation of
\texttt{GLIB} on 20 real-world game apps (with bug reports available) and the
result shows that \texttt{GLIB} can achieve 100\% precision and 99.5\% recall
in detecting non-crashing bugs such as game GUI glitches. Practical application
of \texttt{GLIB} on another 14 real-world games (without bug reports) further
demonstrates that \texttt{GLIB} can effectively uncover GUI glitches, with 48
of 53 bugs reported by \texttt{GLIB} having been confirmed and fixed so far.]]></summary>

This Adversarial-based Selective Cutting network (ASC-Net) bridges the two

model on BraTS brain tumor segmentation, LiTS liver lesion segmentation, and
MS-SEG2015 segmentation tasks. Compared to existing methods like the AnoGAN

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ECG is an attractive option to assess stress in serious Virtual Reality (VR)
applications due to its non-invasive nature. However, the existing Machine
Learning (ML) models perform poorly. Moreover, existing studies only perform a
binary stress assessment, while to develop a more engaging biofeedback-based
application, multi-level assessment is necessary. Existing studies annotate and
classify a single experience (e.g. watching a VR video) to a single stress
level, which again prevents design of dynamic experiences where real-time
in-game stress assessment can be utilized. In this paper, we report our
findings on a new study on VR stress assessment, where three stress levels are
assessed. ECG data was collected from 9 users experiencing a VR roller coaster.
The VR experience was then manually labeled in 10-seconds segments to three
stress levels by three raters. We then propose a novel multimodal deep fusion
model utilizing spectrogram and 1D ECG that can provide a stress prediction
from just a 1-second window. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
model outperforms the classical HRV-based ML models (9% increase in accuracy)
and baseline deep learning models (2.5% increase in accuracy). We also report
results on the benchmark WESAD dataset to show the supremacy of the model.]]></summary>

sepsis is a disparate range of life-threatening organ dysfunctions whose
pathophysiology is not fully understood. Early intervention in sepsis is
crucial for patient outcome, yet those interventions have adverse effects and
are frequently overadministered. Greater personalization is necessary, as no
single action is suitable for all patients. We present a novel application of
reinforcement learning in which we identify optimal recommendations for sepsis
treatment from data, estimate their confidence level, and identify treatment
options infrequently observed in training data. Rather than a single
recommendation, our method can present several treatment options. We examine
learned policies and discover that reinforcement learning is biased against
aggressive intervention due to the confounding relationship between mortality
and level of treatment received. We mitigate this bias using subspace learning,

healthcare applications.]]></summary>

(e.g. deep learning) because of concerns about per-iteration computational
complexity. In this setting highly subsampled first order methods are
preferred. In this work we motivate the extension of Newton methods to the
highly stochastic regime, and argue for the use of the scalable low rank saddle
free Newton (LRSFN) method. In this setting, iterative updates are dominated by
stochastic noise, and stability of the method is key. In stability analysis, we
demonstrate that stochastic errors for Newton methods can be greatly amplified
by ill-conditioned matrix operators. The LRSFN algorithm mitigates this issue
by the use of Levenberg-Marquardt damping, but generally second order methods
with stochastic Hessian and gradient information may need to take small steps,
unlike in deterministic problems. Numerical results show that even under
restrictive step-length conditions, LRSFN can outperform popular first order
methods on nontrivial deep learning tasks in terms of generalizability for
equivalent computational work.]]></summary>

computationally inexpensive representations of higher-order dynamical systems.
Using these representations, ROMs can efficiently model flow fields while using
significantly lesser parameters. Conventional ROMs accomplish this by linearly
projecting higher-order manifolds to lower-dimensional space using
dimensionality reduction techniques such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
(POD). In this work, we develop a novel deep learning framework DL-ROM (Deep
Learning - Reduced Order Modelling) to create a neural network capable of
non-linear projections to reduced order states. We then use the learned reduced
state to efficiently predict future time steps of the simulation using 3D
Autoencoder and 3D U-Net based architectures. Our model DL-ROM is able to
create highly accurate reconstructions from the learned ROM and is thus able to
efficiently predict future time steps by temporally traversing in the learned
reduced state. All of this is achieved without ground truth supervision or
needing to iteratively solve the expensive Navier-Stokes(NS) equations thereby
resulting in massive computational savings. To test the effectiveness and
performance of our approach, we evaluate our implementation on five different
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) datasets using reconstruction performance
and computational runtime metrics. DL-ROM can reduce the computational runtimes
of iterative solvers by nearly two orders of magnitude while maintaining an
acceptable error threshold.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Randomized smoothing has recently emerged as an effective tool that enables
certification of deep neural network classifiers at scale. All prior art on
randomized smoothing has focused on isotropic $\ell_p$ certification, which has
the advantage of yielding certificates that can be easily compared among
isotropic methods via $\ell_p$-norm radius. However, isotropic certification
limits the region that can be certified around an input to worst-case
adversaries, \ie it cannot reason about other "close", potentially large,
constant prediction safe regions. To alleviate this issue, (i) we theoretically
extend the isotropic randomized smoothing $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ certificates to
their generalized anisotropic counterparts following a simplified analysis.
Moreover, (ii) we propose evaluation metrics allowing for the comparison of
general certificates - a certificate is superior to another if it certifies a
superset region - with the quantification of each certificate through the
volume of the certified region. We introduce ANCER, a practical framework for
obtaining anisotropic certificates for a given test set sample via volume
maximization. Our empirical results demonstrate that ANCER achieves
state-of-the-art $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ certified accuracy on both CIFAR-10 and
ImageNet at multiple radii, while certifying substantially larger regions in
terms of volume, thus highlighting the benefits of moving away from isotropic
analysis. Code used in our experiments is available in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continual learning-the ability to learn many tasks in sequence-is critical
for artificial learning systems. Yet standard training methods for deep
networks often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where learning new tasks
erases knowledge of earlier tasks. While catastrophic forgetting labels the
problem, the theoretical reasons for interference between tasks remain unclear.
Here, we attempt to narrow this gap between theory and practice by studying
continual learning in the teacher-student setup. We extend previous analytical
work on two-layer networks in the teacher-student setup to multiple teachers.
Using each teacher to represent a different task, we investigate how the
relationship between teachers affects the amount of forgetting and transfer
exhibited by the student when the task switches. In line with recent work, we
find that when tasks depend on similar features, intermediate task similarity
leads to greatest forgetting. However, feature similarity is only one way in
which tasks may be related. The teacher-student approach allows us to
disentangle task similarity at the level of readouts (hidden-to-output weights)
and features (input-to-hidden weights). We find a complex interplay between
both types of similarity, initial transfer/forgetting rates, maximum
transfer/forgetting, and long-term transfer/forgetting. Together, these results
help illuminate the diverse factors contributing to catastrophic forgetting.]]></summary>

autonomous driving based on pre-recorded data. However, imitation learning
based policies have been shown to be susceptible to compounding errors when
encountering states outside of the training distribution. Further, these agents
have been demonstrated to be easily exploitable by adversarial road users
aiming to create collisions. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce
Adversarial Mixture Density Networks (AMDN), which learns two distributions
from separate datasets. The first is a distribution of safe actions learned
from a dataset of naturalistic human driving. The second is a distribution
representing unsafe actions likely to lead to collision, learned from a dataset
of collisions. During training, we leverage these two distributions to provide
an additional loss based on the similarity of the two distributions. By
penalising the safe action distribution based on its similarity to the unsafe
action distribution when training on the collision dataset, a more robust and
safe control policy is obtained. We demonstrate the proposed AMDN approach in a
vehicle following use-case, and evaluate under naturalistic and adversarial
testing environments. We show that despite its simplicity, AMDN provides
significant benefits for the safety of the learned control policy, when

label is subject to noise from a different distribution. This noise can be
caused by the labelling process, and impacts negatively the performance of the
learning algorithm as it violates the i.i.d. assumptions. In many situations
however, the labelling process is able to estimate the variance of such
distribution for each label, which can be used as an additional information to
mitigate this impact. We adapt an inverse-variance weighted mean square error,
based on the Gauss-Markov theorem, for parameter optimization on neural
networks. We introduce Batch Inverse-Variance, a loss function which is robust
to near-ground truth samples, and allows to control the effective learning

"upstream" learner that does have access to the sensitive features will learn a
proxy model for these features from the other attributes. The goal of the proxy
is to allow a general "downstream" learner -- with minimal assumptions on their
prediction task -- to be able to use the proxy to train a model that is fair

constraints with respect to the downstream model class suffices for this

Manifold Adversarial Examples (LMAEs) via an adversarial game between a
discriminator and a classifier. The proposed adversarial training with latent
distribution (ATLD) method defends against adversarial attacks by crafting
LMAEs with the latent manifold in an unsupervised manner. ATLD preserves the
local and global information of latent manifold and promises improved
robustness against adversarial attacks. To verify the effectiveness of our
proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments over different datasets
(e.g., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN) with different adversarial attacks (e.g.,
PGD, CW), and show that our method substantially outperforms the
state-of-the-art (e.g., Feature Scattering) in adversarial robustness by a
large accuracy margin. The source codes are available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, artificial neural networks have been gaining momentum in the field
of gravitational wave astronomy, for example in surrogate modelling of
computationally expensive waveform models for binary black hole inspiral and
merger. Surrogate modelling yields fast and accurate approximations of
gravitational waves and neural networks have been used in the final step of
interpolating the coefficients of the surrogate model for arbitrary waveforms
outside the training sample. We investigate the existence of underlying
structures in the empirical interpolation coefficients using autoencoders. We
demonstrate that when the coefficient space is compressed to only two
dimensions, a spiral structure appears, wherein the spiral angle is linearly
related to the mass ratio. Based on this finding, we design a spiral module
with learnable parameters, that is used as the first layer in a neural network,
which learns to map the input space to the coefficients. The spiral module is
evaluated on multiple neural network architectures and consistently achieves
better speed-accuracy trade-off than baseline models. A thorough experimental
study is conducted and the final result is a surrogate model which can evaluate
millions of input parameters in a single forward pass in under 1ms on a desktop
GPU, while the mismatch between the corresponding generated waveforms and the
ground-truth waveforms is better than the compared baseline methods. We
anticipate the existence of analogous underlying structures and corresponding
computational gains also in the case of spinning black hole binaries.]]></summary>

approximation or pruning, for which various algorithms have been researched in
recent years. One fundamental question is: what types of compression work
better for a given model? Or even better: can we improve by combining
compressions in a suitable way? We formulate this generally as a problem of
optimizing the loss but where the weights are constrained to equal an additive
combination of separately compressed parts; and we give an algorithm to learn
the corresponding parts' parameters. Experimentally with deep neural nets, we
observe that 1) we can find significantly better models in the
error-compression space, indicating that different compression types have
complementary benefits, and 2) the best type of combination depends exquisitely
on the type of neural net. For example, we can compress ResNets and AlexNet
using only 1 bit per weight without error degradation at the cost of adding a
few floating point weights. However, VGG nets can be better compressed by
combining low-rank with a few floating point weights.]]></summary>

train artificial neural networks (ANNs) with rectified linear unit (ReLU)
activation. Such schemes can be considered as discretizations of gradient flows
(GFs) associated to the training of ANNs with ReLU activation and most of the
key difficulties in the mathematical convergence analysis of GD type
optimization schemes in the training of ANNs with ReLU activation seem to be
already present in the dynamics of the corresponding GF differential equations.
It is the key subject of this work to analyze such GF differential equations in
the training of ANNs with ReLU activation and three layers (one input layer,
one hidden layer, and one output layer). In particular, in this article we
prove in the case where the target function is possibly multi-dimensional and
continuous and in the case where the probability distribution of the input data
is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure that the risk of
every bounded GF trajectory converges to the risk of a critical point. In
addition, in this article we show in the case of a 1-dimensional affine linear
target function and in the case where the probability distribution of the input
data coincides with the standard uniform distribution that the risk of every
bounded GF trajectory converges to zero if the initial risk is sufficiently
small. Finally, in the special situation where there is only one neuron on the
hidden layer (1-dimensional hidden layer) we strengthen the above named result
for affine linear target functions by proving that that the risk of every (not
necessarily bounded) GF trajectory converges to zero if the initial risk is
sufficiently small.]]></summary>

patterns often rely on machine learning techniques to extrapolate motion
patterns from observed trajectories, with no mechanism to directly incorporate

learning and constrained trajectory optimisation. The learning component of our
framework provides a distribution over future motion trajectories conditioned
on observed past coordinates. This distribution is then used as a prior to a
constrained optimisation problem which enforces chance constraints on the
trajectory distribution. This results in constraint-compliant trajectory
distributions which closely resemble the prior. In particular, we focus our
investigation on collision constraints, such that extrapolated future
trajectory distributions conform to the environment structure. We empirically
demonstrate on real-world and simulated datasets the ability of our framework
to learn complex probabilistic motion trajectories for motion data, while
directly enforcing constraints to improve generalisability, producing more

are expensive and time consuming processes which require complex staining and

easier to perform, but is not typically used in this case as it binds to DNA

was not previously thought possible to differentiate cells expressing these
proteins based only on DNA morphology. In this work we show otherwise, training
a deep convolutional neural network to identify cells expressing three proteins

upper and lower bounds: specialists and generalists. Our theoretical results
have very practical consequences: (1) If we use ensemble methods and have the
choice to construct our individual (independent) classifiers from scratch, then
we should aim for specialist classifiers rather than generalists. (2) Our
bounds can be used to determine how many classifiers are at least required to
achieve a desired ensemble accuracy. Finally, we improve our bounds by
considering the mutual information between the true label and the individual

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning practitioners often operate on a computational and monetary
budget. Thus, it is critical to design optimization algorithms that perform
well under any budget. The linear learning rate schedule is considered the best
budget-aware schedule, as it outperforms most other schedules in the low budget
regime. On the other hand, learning rate schedules -- such as the
\texttt{30-60-90} step schedule -- are known to achieve high performance when
the model can be trained for many epochs. Yet, it is often not known a priori
whether one's budget will be large or small; thus, the optimal choice of
learning rate schedule is made on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we frame
the learning rate schedule selection problem as a combination of $i)$ selecting
a profile (i.e., the continuous function that models the learning rate
schedule), and $ii)$ choosing a sampling rate (i.e., how frequently the
learning rate is updated/sampled from this profile). We propose a novel profile
and sampling rate combination called the Reflected Exponential (REX) schedule,
which we evaluate across seven different experimental settings with both SGD
and Adam optimizers. REX outperforms the linear schedule in the low budget
regime, while matching or exceeding the performance of several state-of-the-art
learning rate schedules (linear, step, exponential, cosine, step decay on
plateau, and OneCycle) in both high and low budget regimes. Furthermore, REX
requires no added computation, storage, or hyperparameters.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We propose a method for the blind separation of sounds of musical instruments
in audio signals. We describe the individual tones via a parametric model,
training a dictionary to capture the relative amplitudes of the harmonics. The
model parameters are predicted via a U-Net, which is a type of deep neural
network. The network is trained without ground truth information, based on the
difference between the model prediction and the individual STFT time frames.
Since some of the model parameters do not yield a useful backpropagation
gradient, we model them stochastically and employ the policy gradient instead.
To provide phase information and account for inaccuracies in the
dictionary-based representation, we also let the network output a direct
prediction, which we then use to resynthesize the audio signals for the
individual instruments. Due to the flexibility of the neural network,
inharmonicity can be incorporated seamlessly and no preprocessing of the input
spectra is required. Our algorithm yields high-quality separation results with
particularly low interference on a variety of different audio samples, both
acoustic and synthetic, provided that the sample contains enough data for the
training and that the spectral characteristics of the musical instruments are
sufficiently stable to be approximated by the dictionary.]]></summary>

privacy (DP), capable of deployment to data-driven tasks such as machine

requires the introduction of new tools for automatic sensitivity analysis and
for tracking an individual's data and their features through the flow of
computation. For this purpose, we introduce a novel \textit{hybrid} automatic
differentiation (AD) system which combines the efficiency of reverse-mode AD
with an ability to obtain a closed-form expression for any given quantity in
the computational graph. This enables modelling the sensitivity of arbitrary
differentiable function compositions, such as the training of neural networks
on private data. We demonstrate our approach by analysing the individual DP
guarantees of statistical database queries. Moreover, we investigate the
application of our technique to the training of DP neural networks. Our
approach can enable the principled reasoning about privacy loss in the setting
of data processing, and further the development of automatic sensitivity

learning (RL). Previous works consider the safe exploration problem as
Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the policies are being
optimized under constraints. However, when encountering any potential dangers,
human tends to stop immediately and rarely learns to behave safely in danger.
Motivated by human learning, we introduce a new approach to address safe RL
problems under the framework of Early Terminated MDP (ET-MDP). We first define
the ET-MDP as an unconstrained MDP with the same optimal value function as its
corresponding CMDP. An off-policy algorithm based on context models is then
proposed to solve the ET-MDP, which thereby solves the corresponding CMDP with
better asymptotic performance and improved learning efficiency. Experiments on
various CMDP tasks show a substantial improvement over previous methods that
directly solve CMDP.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning from data that contain missing values represents a common phenomenon
in many domains. Relatively few Bayesian Network structure learning algorithms
account for missing data, and those that do tend to rely on standard approaches
that assume missing data are missing at random, such as the
Expectation-Maximisation algorithm. Because missing data are often systematic,
there is a need for more pragmatic methods that can effectively deal with data
sets containing missing values not missing at random. The absence of approaches
that deal with systematic missing data impedes the application of BN structure
learning methods to real-world problems where missingness are not random. This
paper describes three variants of greedy search structure learning that utilise
pairwise deletion and inverse probability weighting to maximally leverage the
observed data and to limit potential bias caused by missing values. The first
two of the variants can be viewed as sub-versions of the third and best
performing variant, but are important in their own in illustrating the
successive improvements in learning accuracy. The empirical investigations show
that the proposed approach outperforms the commonly used and state-of-the-art
Structural EM algorithm, both in terms of learning accuracy and efficiency, as
well as both when data are missing at random and not at random.]]></summary>

We trained convolutional-bidirectional gated recurrent unit (CNN-BiGRU)
networks for detecting inhalation, exhalation, continuous adventitious sound
(CAS) and discontinuous adventitious sound at the recording level on the basis
of Lung_V2. However, the performance of CAS detection was poor due to many
reasons, one of which is the highly diversified CAS patterns. To make the
original CNN-BiGRU model learn the CAS patterns more effectively and not cause
too much computing burden, three strategies involving minimal modifications of
the network architecture of the CNN layers were investigated: (1) making the
CNN layers a bit deeper by using the residual blocks, (2) making the CNN layers
a bit wider by increasing the number of CNN kernels, and (3) separating the
feature input into multiple paths (the model was denoted by Multi-path
CNN-BiGRU). The performance of CAS segment and event detection were evaluated.
Results showed that improvement in CAS detection was observed among all the
proposed architecture-modified models. The F1 score for CAS event detection of
the proposed models increased from 0.445 to 0.491-0.530, which was deemed
significant. However, the Multi-path CNN-BiGRU model outperformed the other
models in terms of the number of winning titles (five) in total nine evaluation
metrics. In addition, the Multi-path CNN-BiGRU model did not cause extra
computing burden (0.97-fold inference time) compared to the original CNN-BiGRU
model. Conclusively, the Multi-path CNN layers can efficiently improve the
effectiveness of feature extraction and subsequently result in better CAS
detection.]]></summary>

legacies and are usually implemented in different frameworks. In this paper, by
decoupling the concepts of modeling units and label topologies and building
proper numerator/denominator graphs accordingly, we establish a generalized
framework for hybrid acoustic modeling (AM). In this framework, we show that
LF-MMI is a powerful training criterion applicable to both limited-context and
full-context models, for wordpiece/mono-char/bi-char/chenone units, with both
HMM/CTC topologies. From this framework, we propose three novel training
schemes: chenone(ch)/wordpiece(wp)-CTC-bMMI, and wordpiece(wp)-HMM-bMMI with
different advantages in training performance, decoding efficiency and decoding
time-stamp accuracy. The advantages of different training schemes are evaluated
comprehensively on Librispeech, and wp-CTC-bMMI and ch-CTC-bMMI are evaluated
on two real world ASR tasks to show their effectiveness. Besides, we also show
bi-char(bc) HMM-MMI models can serve as better alignment models than
traditional non-neural GMM-HMMs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metric-based few-shot fine-grained image classification (FSFGIC) aims to
learn a transferable feature embedding network by estimating the similarities
between query images and support classes from very few examples. In this work,
we propose, for the first time, to introduce the non-linear data projection
concept into the design of FSFGIC architecture in order to address the limited
sample problem in few-shot learning and at the same time to increase the
discriminability of the model for fine-grained image classification.
Specifically, we first design a feature re-abstraction embedding network that
has the ability to not only obtain the required semantic features for effective
metric learning but also re-enhance such features with finer details from input
images. Then the descriptors of the query images and the support classes are
projected into different non-linear spaces in our proposed similarity metric
learning network to learn discriminative projection factors. This design can
effectively operate in the challenging and restricted condition of a FSFGIC
task for making the distance between the samples within the same class smaller
and the distance between samples from different classes larger and for reducing
the coupling relationship between samples from different categories.
Furthermore, a novel similarity measure based on the proposed non-linear data
project is presented for evaluating the relationships of feature information
between a query image and a support set. It is worth to note that our proposed
architecture can be easily embedded into any episodic training mechanisms for
end-to-end training from scratch. Extensive experiments on FSFGIC tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-art
benchmarks.]]></summary>

iteratively distorts an image by an additive noise until the machine learning
model detects the change in the image by outputting a false label. The amount
of noise added to the original image is defined as the gradient of the cost
function of the machine learning model. This cost function explicitly minimizes
the amount of perturbation applied on the input image and it is regularized by
bounded range and total variation functions to assure perceptual similarity of
the adversarial image to the input. We evaluate the adversarial images
generated by our algorithm both qualitatively and quantitatively on CIFAR10,
ImageNet, and MS COCO datasets. Our experiments on image classification and

both more successful in deceiving the recognition/detection model and less

where derivative information is available, including numerous Bayesian
optimization and regression tasks that arise in the natural sciences.
Incorporating derivative observations, however, comes with a dominating
$O(N^3D^3)$ computational cost when training on $N$ points in $D$ input
dimensions. This is intractable for even moderately sized problems. While
recent work has addressed this intractability in the low-$D$ setting, the
high-$N$, high-$D$ setting is still unexplored and of great value, particularly
as machine learning problems increasingly become high dimensional. In this
paper, we introduce methods to achieve fully scalable Gaussian process
regression with derivatives using variational inference. Analogous to the use
of inducing values to sparsify the labels of a training set, we introduce the
concept of inducing directional derivatives to sparsify the partial derivative
information of a training set. This enables us to construct a variational
posterior that incorporates derivative information but whose size depends
neither on the full dataset size $N$ nor the full dimensionality $D$. We
demonstrate the full scalability of our approach on a variety of tasks, ranging
from a high dimensional stellarator fusion regression task to training graph
convolutional neural networks on Pubmed using Bayesian optimization.
Surprisingly, we find that our approach can improve regression performance even
in settings where only label data is available.]]></summary>

complexity introduced by agents' interactions. We tackle systems with a huge
population of interacting agents (e.g., swarms) via Mean-Field Control (MFC).
MFC considers an asymptotically infinite population of identical agents that
aim to collaboratively maximize the collective reward. Specifically, we
consider the case of unknown system dynamics where the goal is to
simultaneously optimize for the rewards and learn from experience. We propose
an efficient model-based reinforcement learning algorithm
$\text{M}^3\text{-UCRL}$ that runs in episodes and provably solves this
problem. $\text{M}^3\text{-UCRL}$ uses upper-confidence bounds to balance
exploration and exploitation during policy learning. Our main theoretical
contributions are the first general regret bounds for model-based RL for MFC,
obtained via a novel mean-field type analysis. $\text{M}^3\text{-UCRL}$ can be
instantiated with different models such as neural networks or Gaussian
Processes, and effectively combined with neural network policy learning. We
empirically demonstrate the convergence of $\text{M}^3\text{-UCRL}$ on the

and understanding the visual redundancy of the external world. Complex scenes
include enormous redundancy. The human vision system cannot process all
information simultaneously, due to the visual information bottleneck. The human
visual system mainly focuses on dominant parts of scenes, in order to reduce
the redundant input of visual information. This is commonly known as visual
attention prediction or visual saliency map prediction. This paper proposes a
new psychophysical saliency prediction architecture, WECSF, inspired by
multi-channel model of visual cortex functioning in humans. The model consists
of opponent color channels, a wavelet transform and wavelet energy map, and a
contrast sensitivity function for extracting low-level image features and
providing maximum approximation to the human visual system. In this paper, the
proposed model is evaluated using several data sets, including the MIT1003,
MIT300, TORONTO, SID4VAM, and UCF Sports data sets, in order to demonstrate its
efficiency. We also quantitatively and qualitatively compare the saliency
prediction performance with that of other state-of-the-art models. Our model
achieved stable and very good performance. Additionally, Fourier and
spectral-inspired saliency prediction models outperformed other
state-of-the-art non-neural networks (and even deep neural network) models on
psychophysical synthetic images. Finally, the proposed model can also be
applied to spatial-temporal saliency prediction and achieved superior

proven to be crucial in tackling increasingly complex tasks, such as 3D
detection or instance segmentation. State-of-the-art approaches for image-based
detection tasks tackle this complexity by operating in a cascaded fashion: they
first extract a 2D bounding box based on which additional attributes, e.g.
instance masks, are inferred. While these methods perform well, a key challenge
remains the lack of accurate and cheap annotations for the growing variety of
tasks. Synthetic data presents a promising solution but, despite the effort in
domain adaptation research, the gap between synthetic and real data remains an
open problem. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised domain adaptation
setting which exploits the structure of cascaded detection tasks. In
particular, we learn to infer the attributes solely from the source domain
while leveraging 2D bounding boxes as weak labels in both domains to explain
the domain shift. We further encourage domain-invariant features through
class-wise feature alignment using ground-truth class information, which is not
available in the unsupervised setting. As our experiments demonstrate, the
approach is competitive with fully supervised settings while outperforming
unsupervised adaptation approaches by a large margin.]]></summary>

scenarios, under different environmental conditions while facing a variety of
semantic concepts, including unknown ones. To this end, recent works tried to
empower visual object recognition methods with the capability to i) detect
unseen concepts and ii) extended their knowledge over time, as images of new
semantic classes arrive. This setting, called Open World Recognition (OWR), has
the goal to produce systems capable of breaking the semantic limits present in
the initial training set. However, this training set imposes to the system not
only its own semantic limits, but also environmental ones, due to its bias
toward certain acquisition conditions that do not necessarily reflect the high
variability of the real-world. This discrepancy between training and test
distribution is called domain-shift. This work investigates whether OWR
algorithms are effective under domain-shift, presenting the first benchmark
setup for assessing fairly the performances of OWR algorithms, with and without
domain-shift. We then use this benchmark to conduct analyses in various
scenarios, showing how existing OWR algorithms indeed suffer a severe
performance degradation when train and test distributions differ. Our analysis
shows that this degradation is only slightly mitigated by coupling OWR with
domain generalization techniques, indicating that the mere plug-and-play of
existing algorithms is not enough to recognize new and unknown categories in
unseen domains. Our results clearly point toward open issues and future
research directions, that need to be investigated for building robot visual
systems able to function reliably under these challenging yet very real
conditions. Code available at

neural network architecture design and hardware-specific acceleration is one
area that is not well studied in the research literature, with form often
dictated by accuracy as opposed to hardware function. In this study, a
comprehensive empirical exploration is conducted to investigate the impact of
deep neural network architecture design on the degree of inference speedup that
can be achieved via hardware-specific acceleration. More specifically, we
empirically study the impact of a variety of commonly used macro-architecture
design patterns across different architectural depths through the lens of
OpenVINO microprocessor-specific and GPU-specific acceleration. Experimental
results showed that while leveraging hardware-specific acceleration achieved an
average inference speed-up of 380%, the degree of inference speed-up varied
drastically depending on the macro-architecture design pattern, with the
greatest speedup achieved on the depthwise bottleneck convolution design
pattern at 550%. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth exploration of the
correlation between FLOPs requirement, level 3 cache efficacy, and network
latency with increasing architectural depth and width. Finally, we analyze the
inference time reductions using hardware-specific acceleration when compared to
native deep learning frameworks across a wide variety of hand-crafted deep
convolutional neural network architecture designs as well as ones found via
neural architecture search strategies. We found that the DARTS-derived

images. The structure representation relates to the sparse colour blocks and
compresses generic content. The texture representation shows the texture,
curves, and features in cartoon images. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
framework decomposes the images into different representations and learns from
them to generate cartoon images. This decomposition makes the framework more
controllable and flexible which allows users to make changes based on the

human-like intelligent behaviors. The task demands new capabilities to
integrate video processing, language understanding, binding abstract linguistic
concepts to concrete visual artifacts, and deliberative reasoning over
spacetime. Neural networks offer a promising approach to reach this potential
through learning from examples rather than handcrafting features and rules.
However, neural networks are predominantly feature-based - they map data to
unstructured vectorial representation and thus can fall into the trap of
exploiting shortcuts through surface statistics instead of true systematic
reasoning seen in symbolic systems. To tackle this issue, we advocate for
object-centric representation as a basis for constructing spatio-temporal
structures from videos, essentially bridging the semantic gap between low-level
pattern recognition and high-level symbolic algebra. To this end, we propose a
new query-guided representation framework to turn a video into an evolving
relational graph of objects, whose features and interactions are dynamically
and conditionally inferred. The object lives are then summarized into resumes,
lending naturally for deliberative relational reasoning that produces an answer
to the query. The framework is evaluated on major Video QA datasets,
demonstrating clear benefits of the object-centric approach to video reasoning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In person re-identification (Re-ID), supervised methods usually need a large
amount of expensive label information, while unsupervised ones are still unable
to deliver satisfactory identification performance. In this paper, we introduce
a novel person Re-ID task called unsupervised cross-camera person Re-ID, which
only needs the within-camera (intra-camera) label information but not
cross-camera (inter-camera) labels which are more expensive to obtain. In
real-world applications, the intra-camera label information can be easily
captured by tracking algorithms or few manual annotations. In this situation,
the main challenge becomes the distribution discrepancy across different camera
views, caused by the various body pose, occlusion, image resolution,
illumination conditions, and background noises in different cameras. To address
this situation, we propose a novel Adversarial Camera Alignment Network (ACAN)
for unsupervised cross-camera person Re-ID. It consists of the camera-alignment
task and the supervised within-camera learning task. To achieve the camera
alignment, we develop a Multi-Camera Adversarial Learning (MCAL) to map images
of different cameras into a shared subspace. Particularly, we investigate two
different schemes, including the existing GRL (i.e., gradient reversal layer)
scheme and the proposed scheme called "other camera equiprobability" (OCE), to
conduct the multi-camera adversarial task. Based on this shared subspace, we
then leverage the within-camera labels to train the network. Extensive
experiments on five large-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of ACAN
over multiple state-of-the-art unsupervised methods that take advantage of
labeled source domains and generated images by GAN-based models. In particular,
we verify that the proposed multi-camera adversarial task does contribute to
the significant improvement.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some real problems require the evaluation of expensive and noisy objective
functions. Moreover, the analytical expression of these objective functions may
be unknown. These functions are known as black-boxes, for example, estimating
the generalization error of a machine learning algorithm and computing its
prediction time in terms of its hyper-parameters. Multi-objective Bayesian
optimization (MOBO) is a set of methods that has been successfully applied for
the simultaneous optimization of black-boxes. Concretely, BO methods rely on a
probabilistic model of the objective functions, typically a Gaussian process.
This model generates a predictive distribution of the objectives. However, MOBO
methods have problems when the number of objectives in a multi-objective
optimization problem are 3 or more, which is the many objective setting. In
particular, the BO process is more costly as more objectives are considered,
computing the quality of the solution via the hyper-volume is also more costly
and, most importantly, we have to evaluate every objective function, wasting
expensive computational, economic or other resources. However, as more
objectives are involved in the optimization problem, it is highly probable that
some of them are redundant and not add information about the problem solution.
A measure that represents how similar are GP predictive distributions is
proposed. We also propose a many objective Bayesian optimization algorithm that
uses this metric to determine whether two objectives are redundant. The
algorithm stops evaluating one of them if the similarity is found, saving
resources and not hurting the performance of the multi-objective BO algorithm.
We show empirical evidence in a set of toy, synthetic, benchmark and real
experiments that GPs predictive distributions of the effectiveness of the
metric and the algorithm.]]></summary>

directional, and intensity scales. As affine transformations are insufficient
for inter-subject registration, we extend the model to non-rigid deformations.
We illustrate that the proposed model deforms orientation distribution
functions (ODFs) correctly and is capable of handling the classic complex
challenges in DWI-registrations, such as the registration of fiber-crossings
along with kissing, fanning, and interleaving fibers. Our experimental results
clearly illustrate a novel promising regularizing effect, that comes from the

that capably served as a general-purpose backbone for image recognition. Unlike
existing Transformer methods, which employ standard Transformer blocks to
tackle raw images with a fixed resolution, our ResT have several advantages:
(1) A memory-efficient multi-head self-attention is built, which compresses the
memory by a simple depth-wise convolution, and projects the interaction across
the attention-heads dimension while keeping the diversity ability of
multi-heads; (2) Position encoding is constructed as spatial attention, which
is more flexible and can tackle with input images of arbitrary size without
interpolation or fine-tune; (3) Instead of the straightforward tokenization at
the beginning of each stage, we design the patch embedding as a stack of
overlapping convolution operation with stride on the 2D-reshaped token map. We
comprehensively validate ResT on image classification and downstream tasks.
Experimental results show that the proposed ResT can outperform the recently
state-of-the-art backbones by a large margin, demonstrating the potential of
ResT as strong backbones. The code and models will be made publicly available

The utilization of these priors can improve the reconstruction accuracy and

efficiently facilitates the computation of pre- and post-synaptic spikes using
bitfields and integer intrinsics. It offers higher bandwidth than event-driven
plasticity alone and achieves a 1.5x-2x speedup over our closest competitor.
The second optimization targets spike delivery. We partition our graph
representation in a way that bounds the number of neurons that need be updated
at any given time which allows us to perform said update in shared memory
instead of global memory. This is 2x-2.5x faster than our closest competitor.
Both optimizations represent the final evolutionary stages of years of
iteration on STDP and spike delivery inside "Spice" (/spaIk/), our state of the
art SNN simulator. The proposed optimizations are not exclusive to our graph
representation or pipeline but are applicable to a multitude of simulator
designs. We evaluate our performance on three well-established models and
compare ourselves against three other state of the art simulators.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While recent progress has significantly boosted few-shot classification (FSC)
performance, few-shot object detection (FSOD) remains challenging for modern
learning systems. Existing FSOD systems follow FSC approaches, ignoring the
issues of spatial misalignment and vagueness in class representations, and
consequently result in low performance. Observing this, we propose a novel
Dual-Awareness Attention (DAnA) mechanism that can adaptively generate
query-position-aware (QPA) support features and guide the detection networks
precisely. The generated QPA features represent local information of a support
image conditioned on a given region of the query. By taking the spatial
relationships across different images into consideration, our approach
conspicuously outperforms previous FSOD methods (+6.9 AP relatively) and
achieves remarkable results even under a challenging cross-dataset evaluation
setting. Furthermore, the proposed DAnA component is flexible and adaptable to
multiple existing object detection frameworks. By equipping DAnA, conventional
object detection models, Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet, which are not designed
explicitly for few-shot learning, reach state-of-the-art performance in FSOD
tasks.]]></summary>

source domains to facilitate the learning in a target domain. It is
particularly useful when the target domain has few or no labeled data, due to
annotation expense, privacy concerns, etc. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of
TL is not always guaranteed. Negative transfer (NT), i.e., the source domain
data/knowledge cause reduced learning performance in the target domain, has
been a long-standing and challenging problem in TL. Various approaches to
handle NT have been proposed in the literature. However, this filed lacks a
systematic survey on the formalization of NT, their factors and the algorithms
that handle NT. This paper proposes to fill this gap. First, the definition of
negative transfer is considered and a taxonomy of the factors are discussed.
Then, near fifty representative approaches for handling NT are categorized and
reviewed, from four perspectives: secure transfer, domain similarity
estimation, distant transfer and negative transfer mitigation. NT in related
fields, e.g., multi-task learning, lifelong learning, and adversarial attacks
are also discussed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present iGibson, a novel simulation environment to develop robotic
solutions for interactive tasks in large-scale realistic scenes. Our
environment contains 15 fully interactive home-sized scenes with 108 rooms
populated with rigid and articulated objects. The scenes are replicas of
real-world homes, with distribution and the layout of objects aligned to those
of the real world. iGibson integrates several key features to facilitate the
study of interactive tasks: i) generation of high-quality virtual sensor
signals (RGB, depth, segmentation, LiDAR, flow and so on), ii) domain
randomization to change the materials of the objects (both visual and physical)
and/or their shapes, iii) integrated sampling-based motion planners to generate
collision-free trajectories for robot bases and arms, and iv) intuitive
human-iGibson interface that enables efficient collection of human
demonstrations. Through experiments, we show that the full interactivity of the
scenes enables agents to learn useful visual representations that accelerate
the training of downstream manipulation tasks. We also show that iGibson
features enable the generalization of navigation agents, and that the
human-iGibson interface and integrated motion planners facilitate efficient
imitation learning of human demonstrated (mobile) manipulation behaviors.
iGibson is open-source, equipped with comprehensive examples and documentation.

failure due to the ill-conditioned problem, the vanishing/exploding gradient
problem, and the saddle point problem. In this paper, a novel method by acting
the gradient activation function (GAF) on the gradient is proposed to handle
these challenges. Intuitively, the GAF enlarges the tiny gradients and
restricts the large gradient. Theoretically, this paper gives conditions that
the GAF needs to meet, and on this basis, proves that the GAF alleviates the
problems mentioned above. In addition, this paper proves that the convergence
rate of SGD with the GAF is faster than that without the GAF under some
assumptions. Furthermore, experiments on CIFAR, ImageNet, and PASCAL visual
object classes confirm the GAF's effectiveness. The experimental results also
demonstrate that the proposed method is able to be adopted in various deep
neural networks to improve their performance. The source code is publicly

sense become commonplace. Still, a "thorn in the side" of the deep learning
movement is the argument that deep networks are prone to overfitting and are
thus unable to generalize well when datasets are small (as is common in medical
imaging tasks). One way to bolster confidence is to provide mathematical
guarantees, or bounds, on network performance after training which explicitly
quantify the possibility of overfitting. In this work, we explore recent
advances using the PAC-Bayesian framework to provide bounds on generalization
error for large (stochastic) networks. While previous efforts focus on
classification in larger natural image datasets (e.g., MNIST and CIFAR-10), we
apply these techniques to both classification and segmentation in a smaller
medical imagining dataset: the ISIC 2018 challenge set. We observe the
resultant bounds are competitive compared to a simpler baseline, while also
being more explainable and alleviating the need for holdout sets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Differentiable architecture search is prevalent in the field of NAS because
of its simplicity and efficiency, where two paradigms, multi-path algorithms
and single-path methods, are dominated. Multi-path framework (e.g. DARTS) is
intuitive but suffers from memory usage and training collapse. Single-path
methods (e.g.GDAS and ProxylessNAS) mitigate the memory issue and shrink the
gap between searching and evaluation but sacrifice the performance. In this
paper, we propose a conceptually simple yet efficient method to bridge these
two paradigms, referred as Mutually-aware Sub-Graphs Differentiable
Architecture Search (MSG-DAS). The core of our framework is a differentiable
Gumbel-TopK sampler that produces multiple mutually exclusive single-path
sub-graphs. To alleviate the severer skip-connect issue brought by multiple
sub-graphs setting, we propose a Dropblock-Identity module to stabilize the
optimization. To make best use of the available models (super-net and
sub-graphs), we introduce a memory-efficient super-net guidance distillation to
improve training. The proposed framework strikes a balance between flexible
memory usage and searching quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
methods on ImageNet and CIFAR10, where the searched models show a comparable
performance as the most recent approaches.]]></summary>

classification of meaningful UI elements on a screen is a critical step for
many mobile applications such as screen readers and voice control of devices.
Annotating object icons, such as menu, search, and arrow backward, is
especially challenging due to the lack of explicit labels on screens, their
similarity to pictures, and their diverse shapes. Existing studies either use
view hierarchy or pixel based methods to tackle the task. Pixel based
approaches are more popular as view hierarchy features on mobile platforms are
often incomplete or inaccurate, however it leaves out instructional information
in the view hierarchy such as resource-ids or content descriptions. We propose
a novel deep learning based multi-modal approach that combines the benefits of
both pixel and view hierarchy features as well as leverages the
state-of-the-art object detection techniques. In order to demonstrate the
utility provided, we create a high quality UI dataset by manually annotating
the most commonly used 29 icons in Rico, a large scale mobile design dataset
consisting of 72k UI screenshots. The experimental results indicate the
effectiveness of our multi-modal approach. Our model not only outperforms a
widely used object classification baseline but also pixel based object
detection models. Our study sheds light on how to combine view hierarchy with
pixel features for annotating UI elements.]]></summary>

the first work, we analyze and demonstrate the connections between knowledge

\emph{i.e.}, adversarial examples generated against one model can be
transferred to attack other models. Our theoretical studies show that
adversarial transferability indicates knowledge transferability and vice versa.
Moreover, based on the theoretical insights, we propose two practical
adversarial transferability metrics to characterize this process, serving as
bidirectional indicators between adversarial and knowledge transferability. We
conduct extensive experiments for different scenarios on diverse datasets,
showing a positive correlation between adversarial transferability and
knowledge transferability. Our findings will shed light on future research

Experiments on the MS COCO, PASCAL VOC and the KITTI dataset show significant

improvement over Monte-Carlo dropout uncertainty metrics and further
significant boosts by aggregating different sources of uncertainty metrics.The

proper matching metrics. Our work focuses on a neglected part of the tracking
system: score refinement and tracklet termination. We show that manipulating
the scores depending on time consistency while terminating the tracklets
depending on the tracklet score improves tracking results. We do this by
increasing the matched tracklets' score with score update functions and
decreasing the unmatched tracklets' score. Compared to count-based methods, our
method consistently produces better AMOTA and MOTA scores when utilizing
various detectors and filtering algorithms on different datasets. The
improvements in AMOTA score went up to 1.83 and 2.96 in MOTA. We also used our
method as a late-fusion ensembling method, and it performed better than
voting-based ensemble methods by a solid margin. It achieved an AMOTA score of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image inpainting aims to restore the missing regions and make the recovery
results identical to the originally complete image, which is different from the
common generative task emphasizing the naturalness of generated images.
Nevertheless, existing works usually regard it as a pure generation problem and
employ cutting-edge generative techniques to address it. The generative
networks fill the main missing parts with realistic contents but usually
distort the local structures. In this paper, we formulate image inpainting as a
mix of two problems, i.e., predictive filtering and deep generation. Predictive
filtering is good at preserving local structures and removing artifacts but
falls short to complete the large missing regions. The deep generative network
can fill the numerous missing pixels based on the understanding of the whole
scene but hardly restores the details identical to the original ones. To make
use of their respective advantages, we propose the joint predictive filtering
and generative network (JPGNet) that contains three branches: predictive
filtering & uncertainty network (PFUNet), deep generative network, and
uncertainty-aware fusion network (UAFNet). The PFUNet can adaptively predict
pixel-wise kernels for filtering-based inpainting according to the input image
and output an uncertainty map. This map indicates the pixels should be
processed by filtering or generative networks, which is further fed to the
UAFNet for a smart combination between filtering and generative results. Note
that, our method as a novel framework for the image inpainting problem can
benefit any existing generation-based methods. We validate our method on three
public datasets, i.e., Dunhuang, Places2, and CelebA, and demonstrate that our
method can enhance three state-of-the-art generative methods (i.e., StructFlow,
EdgeConnect, and RFRNet) significantly with the slightly extra time cost.]]></summary>

because the pixel level annotations required are expensive to make. Thus
training models on multiple existing domains is desired to increase the output
label-space. Current research shows that there is potential to improve accuracy
across datasets by using multi-domain training, but this has not yet been
successfully extended to datasets of three different non-overlapping domains
without manual labelling. In this paper a method for this is proposed for the
datasets Cityscapes, SUIM and SUN RGB-D, by creating a label-space that spans
all classes of the datasets. Duplicate classes are merged and discrepant
granularity is solved by keeping classes separate. Results show that accuracy
of the multi-domain model has higher accuracy than all baseline models
together, if hardware performance is equalized, as resources are not limitless,
showing that models benefit from additional data even from domains that have
nothing in common.]]></summary>

multi-scale analysis of point clouds. In this paper, we present a novel
data-driven sampler learning strategy for point-wise analysis tasks. Unlike the
widely used sampling technique, Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), we propose to
learn sampling and downstream applications jointly. Our key insight is that
uniform sampling methods like FPS are not always optimal for different tasks:
sampling more points around boundary areas can make the point-wise
classification easier for segmentation. Towards the end, we propose a novel
sampler learning strategy that learns sampling point displacement supervised by
task-related ground truth information and can be trained jointly with the
underlying tasks. We further demonstrate our methods in various point-wise
analysis architectures, including semantic part segmentation, point cloud
completion, and keypoint detection. Our experiments show that jointly learning
of the sampler and task brings remarkable improvement over previous baseline

LIF is a capillary-enhanced volume computed directly from the input OCT-A. We
then construct the local intensity fusion encoder (LIFE) to map a given OCT-A
volume and its LIF counterpart to a shared latent space. The latent space of
LIFE has the same dimensions as the input data and it contains features common
to both modalities. By binarizing this latent space, we obtain a volumetric
vessel segmentation. Our method is evaluated in a human fovea OCT-A and three
zebrafish OCT-A volumes with manual labels. It yields a Dice score of 0.7736 on

semantic segmentation of brain tumors. However, current CNNs and attention
mechanisms are stochastic in nature and neglect the morphological indicators
used by radiologists to manually annotate regions of interest. In this paper,
we introduce a channel and spatial wise asymmetric attention (CASPIAN) by
leveraging the inherent structure of tumors to detect regions of saliency. To
demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed layer, we integrate this into a
well-established convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to achieve
higher Dice scores, with less GPU resources. Also, we investigate the inclusion
of auxiliary multiscale and multiplanar attention branches to increase the
spatial context crucial in semantic segmentation tasks. The resulting
architecture is the new CASPIANET++, which achieves Dice Scores of 91.19% whole
tumor, 87.6% for tumor core and 81.03% for enhancing tumor. Furthermore, driven
by the scarcity of brain tumor data, we investigate the Noisy Student method
for segmentation tasks. Our new Noisy Student Curriculum Learning paradigm,
which infuses noise incrementally to increase the complexity of the training
images exposed to the network, further boosts the enhancing tumor region to
81.53%. Additional validation performed on the BraTS2020 data shows that the
Noisy Student Curriculum Learning method works well without any additional

Recent work in this direction has been deep learning-based, mostly focusing on
extracting structure using fully convolution NN through semantic segmentation.
In this work, we present a novel multi-modal approach for form structure
extraction. Given simple elements such as textruns and widgets, we extract
higher-order structures such as TextBlocks, Text Fields, Choice Fields, and
Choice Groups, which are essential for information collection in forms. To
achieve this, we obtain a local image patch around each low-level element
(reference) by identifying candidate elements closest to it. We process textual
and spatial representation of candidates sequentially through a BiLSTM to
obtain context-aware representations and fuse them with image patch features
obtained by processing it through a CNN. Subsequently, the sequential decoder
takes this fused feature vector to predict the association type between
reference and candidates. These predicted associations are utilized to
determine larger structures through connected components analysis. Experimental
results show the effectiveness of our approach achieving a recall of 90.29%,
73.80%, 83.12%, and 52.72% for the above structures, respectively,
outperforming semantic segmentation baselines significantly. We show the
efficacy of our method through ablations, comparing it against using individual

annotation of the first frame, has been attracting increasing attentions. Many
state-of-the-art approaches have achieved great performance by relying on
online model updating or mask-propagation techniques. However, most online
models require high computational cost due to model fine-tuning during
inference. Most mask-propagation based models are faster but with relatively
low performance due to failure to adapt to object appearance variation. In this
paper, we are aiming to design a new model to make a good balance between speed
and performance. We propose a model, called NPMCA-net, which directly localizes
foreground objects based on mask-propagation and non-local technique by
matching pixels in reference and target frames. Since we bring in information
of both first and previous frames, our network is robust to large object
appearance variation, and can better adapt to occlusions. Extensive experiments
show that our approach can achieve a new state-of-the-art performance with a
fast speed at the same time (86.5% IoU on DAVIS-2016 and 72.2% IoU on
DAVIS-2017, with speed of 0.11s per frame) under the same level comparison.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a large number of parameters
requires huge computational resources, which has limited the application of
CNNs on resources constrained appliances. Decomposition-based methods,
therefore, have been utilized to compress CNNs in recent years. However, since
the compression factor and performance are negatively correlated, the
state-of-the-art works either suffer from severe performance degradation or
have limited low compression factors. To overcome these problems, unlike
previous works compressing layers separately, we propose to compress CNNs and
alleviate performance degradation via joint matrix decomposition. The idea is
inspired by the fact that there are lots of repeated modules in CNNs, and by
projecting weights with the same structures into the same subspace, networks
can be further compressed and even accelerated. In particular, three joint
matrix decomposition schemes are developed, and the corresponding optimization
approaches based on Singular Values Decomposition are proposed. Extensive
experiments are conducted across three challenging compact CNNs and 3 benchmark
data sets to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithms.
As a result, our methods can compress the size of ResNet-34 by 22x with

significant support in the development and testing of Neural Network based
image processing methods. Clinicians often face issues in selecting suitable
image processing algorithm for medical imaging data. A strategy for the
selection of a proper model is presented here. The training data set comprises
optical coherence tomography (OCT) and angiography (OCT-A) images of 50 mice
eyes with more than 100 days follow-up. The data contains images from treated
and untreated mouse eyes. Four deep learning variants are tested for automatic
(a) differentiation of tumor region with healthy retinal layer and (b)
segmentation of 3D ocular tumor volumes. Exhaustive sensitivity analysis of
deep learning models is performed with respect to the number of training and
testing images using 8 eight performance indices to study accuracy,
reliability/reproducibility, and speed. U-net with UVgg16 is best for malign
tumor data set with treatment (having considerable variation) and U-net with
Inception backbone for benign tumor data (with minor variation). Loss value and
root mean square error (R.M.S.E.) are found most and least sensitive
performance indices, respectively. The performance (via indices) is found to be
exponentially improving regarding a number of training images. The segmented
OCT-Angiography data shows that neovascularization drives the tumor volume.
Image analysis shows that photodynamic imaging-assisted tumor treatment
protocol is transforming an aggressively growing tumor into a cyst. An
empirical expression is obtained to help medical professionals to choose a
particular model given the number of images and types of characteristics. We
recommend that the presented exercise should be taken as standard practice
before employing a particular deep learning model for biomedical image
analysis.]]></summary>

be closely inspected by the observer to extract enhanced information. One such
focused application is an offline forensic analysis of surveillance feeds. Due
to the limitations of camera hardware, camera pose, limited bandwidth, varying
illumination conditions, and occlusions, the quality of the surveillance feed
is significantly degraded at times, thereby compromising monitoring of
behavior, activities, and other sporadic information in the scene. For the
proposed research work, we have inspected the effectiveness of four
conventional yet effective SR algorithms and three deep learning-based SR
algorithms to seek the finest method that executes well in a surveillance
environment with limited training data op-tions. These algorithms generate an
enhanced resolution output image from a sin-gle low-resolution (LR) input
image. For performance analysis, a subset of 220 images from six surveillance
datasets has been used, consisting of individuals with varying distances from
the camera, changing illumination conditions, and complex backgrounds. The
performance of these algorithms has been evaluated and compared using both
qualitative and quantitative metrics. These SR algo-rithms have also been
compared based on face detection accuracy. By analyzing and comparing the
performance of all the algorithms, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based
SR technique using an external dictionary proved to be best by achieving robust
face detection accuracy and scoring optimal quantitative metric results under
different surveillance conditions. This is because the CNN layers progressively
learn more complex features using an external dictionary.]]></summary>

high-quality samples. While it has tremendous potential to promote the image

advantage of the multi-scale and multi-channel representation via wavelet

coefficient components, thus learns the image characteristics under coarse and
detail frequency spectrums jointly and effectively. Moreover, such a highly
flexible generative model without adversarial optimization can execute
colorization tasks better under dual consistency terms in wavelet domain,
namely data-consistency and structure-consistency. Specifically, in the
training phase, a set of multi-channel tensors consisting of wavelet
coefficients are used as the input to train the network by denoising score
matching. In the test phase, samples are iteratively generated via annealed
Langevin dynamics with data and structure consistencies. Experiments
demonstrated remarkable improvements of the proposed model on colorization

in machine learning. This has been addressed using many deep and non-deep
learning based methods. Among the methodologies used, that of adversarial
learning is widely applied to solve many deep learning problems along with
domain adaptation. These methods are based on a discriminator that ensures
source and target distributions are close. However, here we suggest that rather
than using a point estimate obtaining by a single discriminator, it would be
useful if a distribution based on ensembles of discriminators could be used to
bridge this gap. This could be achieved using multiple classifiers or using
traditional ensemble methods. In contrast, we suggest that a Monte Carlo
dropout based ensemble discriminator could suffice to obtain the distribution
based discriminator. Specifically, we propose a curriculum based dropout
discriminator that gradually increases the variance of the sample based
distribution and the corresponding reverse gradients are used to align the
source and target feature representations. An ensemble of discriminators helps
the model to learn the data distribution efficiently. It also provides a better
gradient estimates to train the feature extractor. The detailed results and
thorough ablation analysis show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art

input including RGB frames and optical flow. Although combining RGB frames and
optical flow boosts performance significantly, optical flow is a hand-designed
representation which not only requires heavy computation, but also makes it
methodologically unsatisfactory that two-stream methods are often not learned
end-to-end jointly with the flow. In this paper, we argue that optical flow is
dispensable in high-accuracy temporal action detection and image level data
augmentation (ILDA) is the key solution to avoid performance degradation when
optical flow is removed. To evaluate the effectiveness of ILDA, we design a
simple yet efficient one-stage temporal action detector based on single RGB
stream named DaoTAD. Our results show that when trained with ILDA, DaoTAD has
comparable accuracy with all existing state-of-the-art two-stream detectors
while surpassing the inference speed of previous methods by a large margin and
the inference speed is astounding 6668 fps on GeForce GTX 1080 Ti. Code is

emotions or action units from human faces has gradually become more interesting

features are extracted in order to characterize the syntactic, expressive,

insight into document corpora. To perform topic discovery, most existing neural
models either take document bag-of-words (BoW) or sequence of tokens as input
followed by variational inference and BoW reconstruction to learn topic-word
distribution. However, leveraging topic-word distribution for learning better
features during document encoding has not been explored much. To this end, we
develop a framework TAN-NTM, which processes document as a sequence of tokens
through a LSTM whose contextual outputs are attended in a topic-aware manner.
We propose a novel attention mechanism which factors in topic-word distribution
to enable the model to attend on relevant words that convey topic related cues.
The output of topic attention module is then used to carry out variational
inference. We perform extensive ablations and experiments resulting in ~9-15
percentage improvement over score of existing SOTA topic models in NPMI
coherence on several benchmark datasets - 20Newsgroups, Yelp Review Polarity

document-topic features compared to existing topic models through improvement

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data-to-Text Generation (DTG) is a subfield of Natural Language Generation
aiming at transcribing structured data in natural language descriptions. The
field has been recently boosted by the use of neural-based generators which
exhibit on one side great syntactic skills without the need of hand-crafted
pipelines; on the other side, the quality of the generated text reflects the
quality of the training data, which in realistic settings only offer
imperfectly aligned structure-text pairs. Consequently, state-of-art neural
models include misleading statements - usually called hallucinations - in their
outputs. The control of this phenomenon is today a major challenge for DTG, and
is the problem addressed in the paper.

Previous work deal with this issue at the instance level: using an alignment
score for each table-reference pair. In contrast, we propose a finer-grained
approach, arguing that hallucinations should rather be treated at the word
level. Specifically, we propose a Multi-Branch Decoder which is able to
leverage word-level labels to learn the relevant parts of each training
instance. These labels are obtained following a simple and efficient scoring
procedure based on co-occurrence analysis and dependency parsing. Extensive
evaluations, via automated metrics and human judgment on the standard WikiBio
benchmark, show the accuracy of our alignment labels and the effectiveness of
the proposed Multi-Branch Decoder. Our model is able to reduce and control
hallucinations, while keeping fluency and coherence in generated texts. Further
experiments on a degraded version of ToTTo show that our model could be
successfully used on very noisy settings.]]></summary>

We analyze correlations for around 120,000 column pairs, taken from around

For predictions, we exploit pre-trained language models, based on the recently
proposed Transformer architecture. We consider different types of correlations,
multiple prediction methods, and various prediction scenarios. We study the
impact of factors such as column name length or the amount of training data on
prediction accuracy. Altogether, we find that deep neural networks can predict

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The availability of biomedical text data and advances in natural language
processing (NLP) have made new applications in biomedical NLP possible.
Language models trained or fine tuned using domain specific corpora can
outperform general models, but work to date in biomedical NLP has been limited
in terms of corpora and tasks. We present BioALBERT, a domain-specific
adaptation of A Lite Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
(ALBERT), trained on biomedical (PubMed and PubMed Central) and clinical
(MIMIC-III) corpora and fine tuned for 6 different tasks across 20 benchmark
datasets. Experiments show that BioALBERT outperforms the state of the art on
named entity recognition (+11.09% BLURB score improvement), relation extraction
(+0.80% BLURB score), sentence similarity (+1.05% BLURB score), document
classification (+0.62% F1-score), and question answering (+2.83% BLURB score).
It represents a new state of the art in 17 out of 20 benchmark datasets. By
making BioALBERT models and data available, our aim is to help the biomedical
NLP community avoid computational costs of training and establish a new set of
baselines for future efforts across a broad range of biomedical NLP tasks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[State-of-the-art music recommender systems are based on collaborative
filtering, which builds upon learning similarities between users and songs from
the available listening data. These approaches inherently face the cold-start
problem, as they cannot recommend novel songs with no listening history.
Content-aware recommendation addresses this issue by incorporating content
information about the songs on top of collaborative filtering. However, methods
falling in this category rely on a shallow user/item interaction that
originates from a matrix factorization framework. In this work, we introduce
neural content-aware collaborative filtering, a unified framework which
alleviates these limits, and extends the recently introduced neural
collaborative filtering to its content-aware counterpart. We propose a
generative model which leverages deep learning for both extracting content
information from low-level acoustic features and for modeling the interaction
between users and songs embeddings. The deep content feature extractor can
either directly predict the item embedding, or serve as a regularization prior,
yielding two variants (strict} and relaxed) of our model. Experimental results
show that the proposed method reaches state-of-the-art results for a cold-start
music recommendation task. We notably observe that exploiting deep neural
networks for learning refined user/item interactions outperforms approaches
using a more simple interaction model in a content-aware framework.]]></summary>

machine learning models. However, it is not well understood how to design the
collaborative process so as to maximize the combined moderator-model system
performance. This work presents a rigorous study of this problem, focusing on
an approach that incorporates model uncertainty into the collaborative process.
First, we introduce principled metrics to describe the performance of the
collaborative system under capacity constraints on the human moderator,
quantifying how efficiently the combined system utilizes human decisions. Using
these metrics, we conduct a large benchmark study evaluating the performance of
state-of-the-art uncertainty models under different collaborative review
strategies. We find that an uncertainty-based strategy consistently outperforms
the widely used strategy based on toxicity scores, and moreover that the choice
of review strategy drastically changes the overall system performance. Our
results demonstrate the importance of rigorous metrics for understanding and

the utility of uncertainty estimation in this domain.]]></summary>

is a poor fit. The required quality bar is close to perfection, the range of
sentences is extremely narrow, and the sentences are often very different than
the ones in the machine translation training data. This combination of
requirements is novel in the field of domain adaptation for machine

developed to predict users' preference for next-item recommendation. Although a
session can usually reflect a user's current preference, a local shift of the
user's intention within the session may still exist. Specifically, the
interactions that take place in the early positions within a session generally
indicate the user's initial intention, while later interactions are more likely
to represent the latest intention. Such positional information has been rarely
considered in existing methods, which restricts their ability to capture the
significance of interactions at different positions. To thoroughly exploit the
positional information within a session, a theoretical framework is developed
in this paper to provide an in-depth analysis of the positional information. We
formally define the properties of forward-awareness and backward-awareness to
evaluate the ability of positional encoding schemes in capturing the initial
and the latest intention. According to our analysis, existing positional
encoding schemes are generally forward-aware only, which can hardly represent
the dynamics of the intention in a session. To enhance the positional encoding
scheme for the session-based recommendation, a dual positional encoding (DPE)
is proposed to account for both forward-awareness and backward-awareness. Based
on DPE, we propose a novel Positional Recommender (PosRec) model with a
well-designed Position-aware Gated Graph Neural Network module to fully exploit
the positional information for session-based recommendation tasks. Extensive
experiments are conducted on two e-commerce benchmark datasets, Yoochoose and
Diginetica and the experimental results show the superiority of the PosRec by
comparing it with the state-of-the-art session-based recommender models.]]></summary>

recommender system introduces the concept of the session, i.e., a sequence of
interactions between a user and multiple items within a period, to preserve the
user's recent interest. The existing work on the session-based recommender
system mainly relies on mining sequential patterns within individual sessions,
which are not expressive enough to capture more complicated dependency
relationships among items. In addition, it does not consider the cross-session
information due to the anonymity of the session data, where the linkage between
different sessions is prevented. In this paper, we solve these problems with
the graph neural networks technique. First, each session is represented as a
graph rather than a linear sequence structure, based on which a novel Full
Graph Neural Network (FGNN) is proposed to learn complicated item dependency.
To exploit and incorporate cross-session information in the individual
session's representation learning, we further construct a Broadly Connected
Session (BCS) graph to link different sessions and a novel Mask-Readout
function to improve session embedding based on the BCS graph. Extensive
experiments have been conducted on two e-commerce benchmark datasets, i.e.,
Yoochoose and Diginetica, and the experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of our proposal through comparisons with state-of-the-art

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Streaming session-based recommendation (SSR) is a challenging task that
requires the recommender system to do the session-based recommendation (SR) in
the streaming scenario. In the real-world applications of e-commerce and social
media, a sequence of user-item interactions generated within a certain period
are grouped as a session, and these sessions consecutively arrive in the form
of streams. Most of the recent SR research has focused on the static setting
where the training data is first acquired and then used to train a
session-based recommender model. They need several epochs of training over the
whole dataset, which is infeasible in the streaming setting. Besides, they can
hardly well capture long-term user interests because of the neglect or the
simple usage of the user information. Although some streaming recommendation
strategies have been proposed recently, they are designed for streams of
individual interactions rather than streams of sessions. In this paper, we
propose a Global Attributed Graph (GAG) neural network model with a Wasserstein
reservoir for the SSR problem. On one hand, when a new session arrives, a
session graph with a global attribute is constructed based on the current
session and its associate user. Thus, the GAG can take both the global
attribute and the current session into consideration to learn more
comprehensive representations of the session and the user, yielding a better
performance in the recommendation. On the other hand, for the adaptation to the
streaming session scenario, a Wasserstein reservoir is proposed to help
preserve a representative sketch of the historical data. Extensive experiments
on two real-world datasets have been conducted to verify the superiority of the
GAG model compared with the state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

instead of long-term history is a challenging problem in the real-life
session-based recommendation, e.g., e-commerce and media stream. Recent
research of the session-based recommender system mainly focuses on sequential
patterns by utilizing the attention mechanism, which is straightforward for the
session's natural sequence sorted by time. However, the user's preference is
much more complicated than a solely consecutive time pattern in the transition
of item choices. In this paper, therefore, we study the item transition pattern
by constructing a session graph and propose a novel model which collaboratively
considers the sequence order and the latent order in the session graph for a
session-based recommender system. We formulate the next item recommendation
within the session as a graph classification problem. Specifically, we propose
a weighted attention graph layer and a Readout function to learn embeddings of

inference of posterior distributions. To address this challenge, variational
Bayes (VB) methods have emerged as a popular alternative to the classical
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. VB methods tend to be faster while
achieving comparable predictive performance. However, there are few theoretical
results around VB. In this paper, we establish frequentist consistency and
asymptotic normality of VB methods. Specifically, we connect VB methods to
point estimates based on variational approximations, called frequentist
variational approximations, and we use the connection to prove a variational
Bernstein-von Mises theorem. The theorem leverages the theoretical
characterizations of frequentist variational approximations to understand
asymptotic properties of VB. In summary, we prove that (1) the VB posterior
converges to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) minimizer of a normal distribution,
centered at the truth and (2) the corresponding variational expectation of the
parameter is consistent and asymptotically normal. As applications of the
theorem, we derive asymptotic properties of VB posteriors in Bayesian mixture
models, Bayesian generalized linear mixed models, and Bayesian stochastic block
models. We conduct a simulation study to illustrate these theoretical results.]]></summary>

target domain labels by transferring knowledge from a labeled source domain
whose distribution differs from the target. However, UDA is not always
successful and several accounts of "negative transfer" have been reported in
the literature. In this work, we prove a simple lower bound on the target
domain error that complements the existing upper bound. Our bound shows the
insufficiency of minimizing source domain error and marginal distribution
mismatch for a guaranteed reduction in the target domain error, due to the
possible increase of induced labeling function mismatch. This insufficiency is
further illustrated through simple distributions for which the same UDA
approach succeeds, fails, and may succeed or fail with an equal chance.
Motivated from this, we propose novel data poisoning attacks to fool UDA
methods into learning representations that produce large target domain errors.
We evaluate the effect of these attacks on popular UDA methods using benchmark
datasets where they have been previously shown to be successful. Our results
show that poisoning can significantly decrease the target domain accuracy,
dropping it to almost 0\% in some cases, with the addition of only 10\%
poisoned data in the source domain. The failure of UDA methods demonstrates the
limitations of UDA at guaranteeing cross-domain generalization consistent with
the lower bound. Thus, evaluation of UDA methods in adversarial settings such
as data poisoning can provide a better sense of their robustness in scenarios
unfavorable for UDA.]]></summary>

module, which reacts to the changes in quality, and automatically adjusts the
camera parameters to enhance the accuracy of insights. We improve the training
time of the RL module by an order of magnitude by designing virtual models to
mimic essential behavior of the camera: we design virtual knobs that can be set
to different values to mimic the effects of assigning different values to the
camera's configurable parameters, and we design a virtual camera model that
mimics the output from a video camera at different times of the day. These
virtual models significantly accelerate training because (a) frame rates from a
real camera are limited to 25-30 fps while the virtual models enable processing
at 300 fps, (b) we do not have to wait until the real camera sees different
environments, which could take weeks or months, and (c) virtual knobs can be
updated instantly, while it can take 200-500 ms to change the camera parameter
settings. Our dynamic tuning approach results in up to 12% improvement in the
accuracy of insights from several video analytics tasks.]]></summary>

method is a modification for sparse data of a well-known box-counting algorithm
for Minkowski dimension calculation. The probabilistic method is new. Although
it exploits standard nearest neighborhood distance, it is different from

Learning (RL) with a Transformer-based model that learns to combine
proprioceptive information and high-dimensional depth sensor inputs. While
learning-based locomotion has made great advances using RL, most methods still
rely on domain randomization for training blind agents that generalize to
challenging terrains. Our key insight is that proprioceptive states only offer
contact measurements for immediate reaction, whereas an agent equipped with
visual sensory observations can learn to proactively maneuver environments with
obstacles and uneven terrain by anticipating changes in the environment many
steps ahead. In this paper, we introduce LocoTransformer, an end-to-end RL
method for quadrupedal locomotion that leverages a Transformer-based model for
fusing proprioceptive states and visual observations. We evaluate our method in
challenging simulated environments with different obstacles and uneven terrain.
We show that our method obtains significant improvements over policies with
only proprioceptive state inputs, and that Transformer-based models further
improve generalization across environments. Our project page with videos is at

consists of two components: a base policy and an adaptation module. The

RMA on a varied terrain generator using bioenergetics-inspired rewards and
deploy it on a variety of difficult terrains including rocky, slippery,
deformable surfaces in environments with grass, long vegetation, concrete,

have thus far been hampered by the data scarcity present in the medical world.
Automated diagnosis studies have been constrained by underpowered single-center
datasets, and although some results have shown promise, their generalizability
to other institutions remains questionable as the data heterogeneity between
institutions is not taken into account. By allowing models to be trained in a
distributed manner that preserves patients' privacy, federated learning
promises to alleviate these issues, by enabling diligent multi-center studies.
We present the first federated learning study on the modality of cardiovascular
magnetic resonance (CMR) and use four centers derived from subsets of the M\&M
and ACDC datasets, focusing on the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(HCM). We adapt a 3D-CNN network pretrained on action recognition and explore
two different ways of incorporating shape prior information to the model, and
four different data augmentation set-ups, systematically analyzing their impact
on the different collaborative learning choices. We show that despite the small
size of data (180 subjects derived from four centers), the privacy preserving
federated learning achieves promising results that are competitive with
traditional centralized learning. We further find that federatively trained
models exhibit increased robustness and are more sensitive to domain shift
effects.]]></summary>

Management (PHM) of industrial asset is presented. The work attempts to provide
an overview of the general trend of XAI in PHM, answers the question of
accuracy versus explainability, investigates the extent of human role,
explainability evaluation and uncertainty management in PHM XAI. Research
articles linked to PHM XAI, in English language, from 2015 to 2021 are selected
from IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, ACM Digital Library and Scopus
databases using PRISMA guidelines. Data was extracted from 35 selected articles
and examined using MS. Excel. Several findings were synthesized. Firstly, while
the discipline is still young, the analysis indicates the growing acceptance of
XAI in PHM domain. Secondly, XAI functions as a double edge sword, where it is
assimilated as a tool to execute PHM tasks as well as a mean of explanation, in
particular in diagnostic and anomaly detection. There is thus a need for XAI in
PHM. Thirdly, the review shows that PHM XAI papers produce either good or
excellent results in general, suggesting that PHM performance is unaffected by
XAI. Fourthly, human role, explainability metrics and uncertainty management
are areas requiring further attention by the PHM community. Adequate
explainability metrics to cater for PHM need are urgently needed. Finally, most
case study featured on the accepted articles are based on real, indicating that
available AI and XAI approaches are equipped to solve complex real-world
challenges, increasing the confidence of AI model adoption in the industry.

identification of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) due to its ability to obtain
high resolution information about the genes and mechanisms that are causing
resistance and driving pathogen mobility. By contrast, traditional phenotypic
(antibiogram) testing cannot easily elucidate such information. Yet development
of AMR prediction tools from genotype-phenotype data can be biased, since
sampling is non-randomized. Sample provenience, period of collection, and
species representation can confound the association of genetic traits with AMR.
Thus, prediction models can perform poorly on new data with sampling
distribution shifts. In this work -- under an explicit set of causal
assumptions -- we evaluate the effectiveness of propensity-based rebalancing
and confounding adjustment on AMR prediction using genotype-phenotype AMR data
from the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC). We select bacterial
genotypes (encoded as k-mer signatures, i.e. DNA fragments of length k),
country, year, species, and AMR phenotypes for the tetracycline drug class,
preparing test data with recent genomes coming from a single country. We test
boosted logistic regression (BLR) and random forests (RF) with/without
bias-handling. On 10,936 instances, we find evidence of species, location and
year imbalance with respect to the AMR phenotype. The crude versus
bias-adjusted change in effect of genetic signatures on AMR varies but only
moderately (selecting the top 20,000 out of 40+ million k-mers). The area under
the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of the RF (0.95) is comparable to
that of BLR (0.94) on both out-of-bag samples from bootstrap and the external
test (n=1,085), where AUROCs do not decrease. We observe a 1%-5% gain in AUROC
with bias-handling compared to the sole use of genetic signatures. ...]]></summary>

dynamic obstacles. Instead of directly measuring the scene depth with a LiDAR
sensor, we explore the use of a much cheaper and higher resolution sensor:
programmable light curtains. Light curtains are controllable depth sensors that
sense only along a surface that a user selects. We use light curtains to
estimate the safety envelope of a scene: a hypothetical surface that separates
the robot from all obstacles. We show that generating light curtains that sense
random locations (from a particular distribution) can quickly discover the
safety envelope for scenes with unknown objects. Importantly, we produce
theoretical safety guarantees on the probability of detecting an obstacle using
random curtains. We combine random curtains with a machine learning based model
that forecasts and tracks the motion of the safety envelope efficiently. Our
method accurately estimates safety envelopes while providing probabilistic
safety guarantees that can be used to certify the efficacy of a robot
perception system to detect and avoid dynamic obstacles. We evaluate our
approach in a simulated urban driving environment and a real-world environment
with moving pedestrians using a light curtain device and show that we can
estimate safety envelopes efficiently and effectively. Project website:

to their intermittent nature. Nevertheless, the unified European energy market
promotes the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) by the
regional energy system operators. Consequently, RES forecasting can assist in
the integration of these volatile energy sources, since it leads to higher
reliability and reduced ancillary operational costs for power systems. This
paper presents a new dataset for solar and wind energy generation forecast in
Greece and introduces a feature engineering pipeline that enriches the
dimensional space of the dataset. In addition, we propose a novel method that
utilizes the innovative Prophet model, an end-to-end forecasting tool that
considers several kinds of nonlinear trends in decomposing the energy time
series before a tree-based ensemble provides short-term predictions. The
performance of the system is measured through representative evaluation
metrics, and by estimating the model's generalization under an industryprovided
scheme of absolute error thresholds. The proposed hybrid model competes with
baseline persistence models, tree-based regression ensembles, and the Prophet
model, managing to outperform them, presenting both lower error rates and more
favorable error distribution.]]></summary>

emphasized with an increasing amount of attention paid to Intelligent Tutoring
System (ITS). However, since labels for academic performance, such as test
scores, are collected from outside of ITS, obtaining the labels is costly,
leading to label-scarcity problem which brings challenge in taking machine
learning approaches for academic performance prediction. To this end, inspired
by the recent advancement of pre-training method in natural language processing
community, we propose DPA, a transfer learning framework with Discriminative
Pre-training tasks for Academic performance prediction. DPA pre-trains two
models, a generator and a discriminator, and fine-tunes the discriminator on
academic performance prediction. In DPA's pre-training phase, a sequence of
interactions where some tokens are masked is provided to the generator which is
trained to reconstruct the original sequence. Then, the discriminator takes an
interaction sequence where the masked tokens are replaced by the generator's
outputs, and is trained to predict the originalities of all tokens in the
sequence. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art generative pre-training
method, DPA is more sample efficient, leading to fast convergence to lower
academic performance prediction error. We conduct extensive experimental
studies on a real-world dataset obtained from a multi-platform ITS application
and show that DPA outperforms the previous state-of-the-art generative
pre-training method with a reduction of 4.05% in mean absolute error and more
robust to increased label-scarcity.]]></summary>

in event logs of IT-systems, with process discovery the task of inferring a
process model for an event log emitted by some unknown system. One quality
criterion for discovered process models is generalization. Generalization seeks
to quantify how well the discovered model describes future executions of the
system, and is perhaps the least understood quality criterion in process
mining. The lack of understanding is primarily a consequence of generalization
seeking to measure properties over the entire future behavior of the system,
when the only available sample of behavior is that provided by the event log
itself. In this paper, we draw inspiration from computational statistics, and
employ a bootstrap approach to estimate properties of a population based on a
sample. Specifically, we define an estimator of the model's generalization
based on the event log it was discovered from, and then use bootstrapping to
measure the generalization of the model with respect to the system, and its
statistical significance. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the
approach in industrial settings.]]></summary>

distributions in the context of local differential privacy. The initial data
$x_1,\ldots,x_n \in [K]$ are supposed i.i.d. and distributed according to an
unknown discrete distribution $p = (p_1,\ldots,p_K)$. Only $\alpha$-locally
differentially private (LDP) samples $z_1,...,z_n$ are publicly available,
where the term 'local' means that each $z_i$ is produced using one individual
attribute $x_i$. We exhibit privacy mechanisms (PM) that are interactive (i.e.
they are allowed to use already published confidential data) or
non-interactive. We describe the behavior of the quadratic risk for estimating
the power sum functional $F_{\gamma} = \sum_{k=1}^K p_k^{\gamma}$, $\gamma >0$
as a function of $K, \, n$ and $\alpha$. In the non-interactive case, we study
two plug-in type estimators of $F_{\gamma}$, for all $\gamma >0$, that are
similar to the MLE analyzed by Jiao et al. (2017) in the multinomial model.
However, due to the privacy constraint the rates we attain are slower and
similar to those obtained in the Gaussian model by Collier et al. (2020). In
the interactive case, we introduce for all $\gamma >1$ a two-step procedure
which attains the faster parametric rate $(n \alpha^2)^{-1/2}$ when $\gamma
\geq 2$. We give lower bounds results over all $\alpha$-LDP mechanisms and all
estimators using the private samples.]]></summary>

this paper, we describe a case-based reasoning approach to predicting stock

impediments for case-based stock prediction has been the lack of a suitable
similarity metric when it comes to identifying similar pricing histories as the
basis for a future prediction -- traditional Euclidean and correlation based
approaches are not effective for a variety of reasons -- and in this regard, a
key contribution of this work is the development of a novel similarity metric
for comparing historical pricing data. We demonstrate the benefits of this

a variety of conventional benchmarks.]]></summary>

resulting in downlinking of terabytes of data each day. The data received by
ground stations is often unprocessed, making this an expensive process
considering the large data sizes and that not all of the data is useful. This,
coupled with the increasing demand for real-time data processing, has led to a
growing need for on-orbit processing solutions. In this work, we investigate
the performance of CNN-based object detectors on constrained devices by
applying different image compression techniques to satellite data. We examine
the capabilities of the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier;
low-power, high-performance computers, with integrated GPUs, small enough to
fit on-board a nanosatellite. We take a closer look at object detection
networks, including the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and Region-based
Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN) models that are pre-trained on DOTA - a
Large Scale Dataset for Object Detection in Aerial Images. The performance is
measured in terms of execution time, memory consumption, and accuracy, and are
compared against a baseline containing a server with two powerful GPUs. The
results show that by applying image compression techniques, we are able to
improve the execution time and memory consumption, achieving a fully runnable
dataset. A lossless compression technique achieves roughly a 10% reduction in
execution time and about a 3% reduction in memory consumption, with no impact
on the accuracy. While a lossy compression technique improves the execution
time by up to 144% and the memory consumption is reduced by as much as 97%.
However, it has a significant impact on accuracy, varying depending on the
compression ratio. Thus the application and ratio of these compression
techniques may differ depending on the required level of accuracy for a
particular task.]]></summary>

visual understanding - the former provides sparse but accurate locations of
points on objects, while the latter contains dense color and texture
information. Despite this potential for close sensor fusion, many methods train
two models in isolation and use simple feature concatenation to represent 3D
sensor data. This separated training scheme results in potentially sub-optimal
performance and prevents 3D tasks from being used to benefit 2D tasks that are
often useful on their own. To provide a more integrated approach, we propose a
novel Multi-Modality Task Cascade network (MTC-RCNN) that leverages 3D box
proposals to improve 2D segmentation predictions, which are then used to
further refine the 3D boxes. We show that including a 2D network between two
stages of 3D modules significantly improves both 2D and 3D task performance.
Moreover, to prevent the 3D module from over-relying on the overfitted 2D
predictions, we propose a dual-head 2D segmentation training and inference
scheme, allowing the 2nd 3D module to learn to interpret imperfect 2D
segmentation predictions. Evaluating our model on the challenging SUN RGB-D

However, recently unsupervised simultaneous feature learning and clustering
using neural networks also known as Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) has gained

relevant clustering loss function and choosing the right neural network for
extracting features. A central problem in all these cases is data sparsity
accompanied by high intra-class and low inter-class variance, which
subsequently leads to poor clustering performance and erroneous candidate
assignments. Towards this, we employ data augmentation techniques to improve
the density of the clusters, thus improving the overall performance. We train a
variant of Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) with augmented data to construct the
initial feature space as a novel model for deep clustering. We demonstrate the

score-based approaches, the conditional diffusion model is explicitly trained
for imputation and can exploit correlations between observed values. On
healthcare and environmental data, CSDI improves by 40-70% over existing
probabilistic imputation methods on popular performance metrics. In addition,
deterministic imputation by CSDI reduces the error by 5-20% compared to the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many current neural networks for medical imaging generalise poorly to data
unseen during training. Such behaviour can be caused by networks overfitting
easy-to-learn, or statistically dominant, features while disregarding other
potentially informative features. For example, indistinguishable differences in
the sharpness of the images from two different scanners can degrade the
performance of the network significantly. All neural networks intended for
clinical practice need to be robust to variation in data caused by differences
in imaging equipment, sample preparation and patient populations.

To address these challenges, we evaluate the utility of spectral decoupling
as an implicit bias mitigation method. Spectral decoupling encourages the
neural network to learn more features by simply regularising the networks'
unnormalised prediction scores with an L2 penalty, thus having no added
computational costs.

We show that spectral decoupling allows training neural networks on datasets
with strong spurious correlations. Networks trained without spectral decoupling
do not learn the original task and appear to make false predictions based on
the spurious correlations. Spectral decoupling also increases networks'
robustness for data distribution shifts. To validate our findings, we train
networks with and without spectral decoupling to detect prostate cancer tissue
slides and COVID-19 in chest radiographs. Networks trained with spectral
decoupling achieve substantially higher performance on all evaluation datasets.

Our results show that spectral decoupling helps with generalisation issues
associated with neural networks. We recommend using spectral decoupling as an
implicit bias mitigation method in any neural network intended for clinical
use.]]></summary>

world as we knew at the start of the 3rd decade of the 21st century.
Particularly, COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected financial econometrics
and stock markets across the globe. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine
Learning (ML)-based prediction models, especially Deep Neural Network (DNN)
architectures, have the potential to act as a key enabling factor to reduce the
adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and future possible ones on financial
markets. In this regard, first, a unique COVID-19 related PRIce MOvement
prediction (COVID19 PRIMO) dataset is introduced in this paper, which
incorporates effects of social media trends related to COVID-19 on stock market
price movements. Afterwards, a novel hybrid and parallel DNN-based framework is
proposed that integrates different and diversified learning architectures.
Referred to as the COVID-19 adopted Hybrid and Parallel deep fusion framework
for Stock price Movement Prediction (COVID19-HPSMP), innovative fusion
strategies are used to combine scattered social media news related to COVID-19
with historical mark data. The proposed COVID19-HPSMP consists of two parallel
paths (hence hybrid), one based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with
Local/Global Attention modules, and one integrated CNN and Bi-directional Long
Short term Memory (BLSTM) path. The two parallel paths are followed by a
multilayer fusion layer acting as a fusion centre that combines localized
features. Performance evaluations are performed based on the introduced COVID19
PRIMO dataset illustrating superior performance of the proposed framework.]]></summary>

functions under both the Gaussian and Laplace measures. In particular, we study
$s$-sparse functions of the form $f(x) = \sum_{j=1}^s a_j e^{i \lambda_j x}$
for coefficients $a_j \in \mathbb{C}$ and frequencies $\lambda_j \in
\mathbb{R}$. Bounding Fourier sparse leverage scores under various measures is
of pure mathematical interest in approximation theory, and our work extends
existing results for the uniform measure [Erd17,CP19a]. Practically, our bounds
are motivated by two important applications in machine learning:

1. Kernel Approximation. They yield a new random Fourier features algorithm
for approximating Gaussian and Cauchy (rational quadratic) kernel matrices. For
low-dimensional data, our method uses a near optimal number of features, and
its runtime is polynomial in the $statistical\ dimension$ of the approximated
kernel matrix. It is the first "oblivious sketching method" with this property
for any kernel besides the polynomial kernel, resolving an open question of
[AKM+17,AKK+20b].

2. Active Learning. They can be used as non-uniform sampling distributions
for robust active learning when data follows a Gaussian or Laplace
distribution. Using the framework of [AKM+19], we provide essentially optimal
results for bandlimited and multiband interpolation, and Gaussian process
regression. These results generalize existing work that only applies to
uniformly distributed data.]]></summary>

credit risk modelling is particularly challenging, as, often, the same sources
of information are not available. Therefore, it is standard policy for a loan
officer to provide a textual loan assessment to mitigate limited data
availability. In turn, this statement is analysed by a credit expert alongside
any available standard credit data. In our paper, we exploit recent advances
from the field of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP),
including the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
model, to extract information from 60 000 textual assessments provided by a
lender. We consider the performance in terms of the AUC (Area Under the
receiver operating characteristic Curve) and Brier Score metrics and find that
the text alone is surprisingly effective for predicting default. However, when
combined with traditional data, it yields no additional predictive capability,
with performance dependent on the text's length. Our proposed deep learning
model does, however, appear to be robust to the quality of the text and
therefore suitable for partly automating the mSME lending process. We also
demonstrate how the content of loan assessments influences performance, leading
us to a series of recommendations on a new strategy for collecting future mSME

learning dynamics from data. A growing body of work has been exploring ways to
enforce energy conservation in the learned dynamics by encoding Lagrangian or
Hamiltonian dynamics into the neural network architecture. These existing
approaches are based on differential equations, which do not allow
discontinuity in the states and thereby limit the class of systems one can
learn. However, in reality, most physical systems, such as legged robots and
robotic manipulators, involve contacts and collisions, which introduce
discontinuities in the states. In this paper, we introduce a differentiable
contact model, which can capture contact mechanics: frictionless/frictional, as
well as elastic/inelastic. This model can also accommodate inequality
constraints, such as limits on the joint angles. The proposed contact model
extends the scope of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian neural networks by allowing
simultaneous learning of contact and system properties. We demonstrate this
framework on a series of challenging 2D and 3D physical systems with different
coefficients of restitution and friction. The learned dynamics can be used as a
differentiable physics simulator for downstream gradient-based optimization
tasks, such as planning and control.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the growing awareness to fairness in machine learning and the
realization of the central role that data representation has in data processing
tasks, there is an obvious interest in notions of fair data representations.
The goal of such representations is that a model trained on data under the
representation (e.g., a classifier) will be guaranteed to respect some fairness
constraints.

Such representations are useful when they can be fixed for training models on
various different tasks and also when they serve as data filtering between the
raw data (known to the representation designer) and potentially malicious
agents that use the data under the representation to learn predictive models
and make decisions.

A long list of recent research papers strive to provide tools for achieving
these goals.

However, we prove that this is basically a futile effort. Roughly stated, we
prove that no representation can guarantee the fairness of classifiers for
different tasks trained using it; even the basic goal of achieving
label-independent Demographic Parity fairness fails once the marginal data
distribution shifts. More refined notions of fairness, like Odds Equality,
cannot be guaranteed by a representation that does not take into account the
task specific labeling rule with respect to which such fairness will be
evaluated (even if the marginal data distribution is known a priory).
Furthermore, except for trivial cases, no representation can guarantee Odds
Equality fairness for any two different tasks, while allowing accurate label
predictions for both.

While some of our conclusions are intuitive, we formulate (and prove) crisp
statements of such impossibilities, often contrasting impressions conveyed by
many recent works on fair representations.]]></summary>

optimization that automatically induces hierarchy. Multiple algorithms have
been proposed to solve the optimization problem: subgradient descent by Hocking
et al., ADMM and ADA by Chi and Lange, stochastic incremental algorithm by
Panahi et al. and semismooth Newton-CG augmented Lagrangian method by Sun et
al. All algorithms yield approximate solutions, even though an exact solution
is demanded to determine the correct cluster assignment. The purpose of this
paper is to close the gap between the output from existing algorithms and the
exact solution to the optimization problem. We present a clustering test that
identifies and certifies the correct cluster assignment from an approximate
solution yielded by any primal-dual algorithm. Our certification validates
clustering for both unit and multiplicative weights. The test may not succeed
if the approximation is inaccurate. However, we show the correct cluster
assignment is guaranteed to be certified by a primal-dual path following
algorithm after sufficiently many iterations, provided that the model parameter
$\lambda$ avoids a finite number of bad values. Numerical experiments are
conducted on Gaussian mixture and half-moon data, which indicate that carefully
chosen multiplicative weights increase the recovery power of sum-of-norms
clustering.]]></summary>

models exhibited discrimination among people based on race, sex, age, etc.
Research has been conducted to measure and mitigate unfairness in machine
learning models. For a machine learning task, it is a common practice to build
a pipeline that includes an ordered set of data preprocessing stages followed
by a classifier. However, most of the research on fairness has considered a
single classifier based prediction task. What are the fairness impacts of the
preprocessing stages in machine learning pipeline? Furthermore, studies showed
that often the root cause of unfairness is ingrained in the data itself, rather
than the model. But no research has been conducted to measure the unfairness
caused by a specific transformation made in the data preprocessing stage. In
this paper, we introduced the causal method of fairness to reason about the
fairness impact of data preprocessing stages in ML pipeline. We leveraged
existing metrics to define the fairness measures of the stages. Then we
conducted a detailed fairness evaluation of the preprocessing stages in 37
pipelines collected from three different sources. Our results show that certain
data transformers are causing the model to exhibit unfairness. We identified a
number of fairness patterns in several categories of data transformers.
Finally, we showed how the local fairness of a preprocessing stage composes in
the global fairness of the pipeline. We used the fairness composition to choose
appropriate downstream transformer that mitigates unfairness in the machine

from several different areas. Despite their growing popularity, their
predictive performance is usually affected by the values assigned to their
hyperparameters (HPs). As consequence, researchers and practitioners face the
challenge of how to set these values. Many users have limited knowledge about
ML algorithms and the effect of their HP values and, therefore, do not take
advantage of suitable settings. They usually define the HP values by trial and
error, which is very subjective, not guaranteed to find good values and
dependent on the user experience. Tuning techniques search for HP values able
to maximize the predictive performance of induced models for a given dataset,
but have the drawback of a high computational cost. Thus, practitioners use
default values suggested by the algorithm developer or by tools implementing
the algorithm. Although default values usually result in models with acceptable
predictive performance, different implementations of the same algorithm can
suggest distinct default values. To maintain a balance between tuning and using
default values, we propose a strategy to generate new optimized default values.
Our approach is grounded on a small set of optimized values able to obtain
predictive performance values better than default settings provided by popular
tools. After performing a large experiment and a careful analysis of the
results, we concluded that our approach delivers better default values.
Besides, it leads to competitive solutions when compared to tuned values,
making it easier to use and having a lower cost. We also extracted simple rules
to guide practitioners in deciding whether to use our new methodology or a HP
tuning approach.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The high computation, memory, and power budgets of inferring convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) are major bottlenecks of model deployment to edge
computing platforms, e.g., mobile devices and IoT. Moreover, training CNNs is
time and energy-intensive even on high-grade servers. Convolution layers and
fully connected layers, because of their intense use of multiplications, are
the dominant contributor to this computation budget.

We propose to alleviate this problem by introducing two new operations:
convolutional shifts and fully-connected shifts which replace multiplications
with bitwise shift and sign flipping during both training and inference. During
inference, both approaches require only 5 bits (or less) to represent the
weights. This family of neural network architectures (that use convolutional
shifts and fully connected shifts) is referred to as DeepShift models. We
propose two methods to train DeepShift models: DeepShift-Q which trains regular
weights constrained to powers of 2, and DeepShift-PS that trains the values of
the shifts and sign flips directly.

Very close accuracy, and in some cases higher accuracy, to baselines are
achieved. Converting pre-trained 32-bit floating-point baseline models of
ResNet18, ResNet50, VGG16, and GoogleNet to DeepShift and training them for 15
to 30 epochs, resulted in Top-1/Top-5 accuracies higher than that of the
original model.

Last but not least, we implemented the convolutional shifts and fully
connected shift GPU kernels and showed a reduction in latency time of 25% when
inferring ResNet18 compared to unoptimized multiplication-based GPU kernels.

potential to improve learning from data by avoiding local optima of training
objectives. For reinforcement learning (RL), curricula are especially
interesting, as the underlying optimization has a strong tendency to get stuck
in local optima due to the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Recently, a
number of approaches for an automatic generation of curricula for RL have been
shown to increase performance while requiring less expert knowledge compared to
manually designed curricula. However, these approaches are seldomly
investigated from a theoretical perspective, preventing a deeper understanding
of their mechanics. In this paper, we present an approach for automated
curriculum generation in RL with a clear theoretical underpinning. More
precisely, we formalize the well-known self-paced learning paradigm as inducing
a distribution over training tasks, which trades off between task complexity
and the objective to match a desired task distribution. Experiments show that
training on this induced distribution helps to avoid poor local optima across
RL algorithms in different tasks with uninformative rewards and challenging
exploration requirements.]]></summary>

privacy-preserving data publishing that addresses the shortcomings of
traditional anonymisation techniques. The promise is that synthetic data drawn
from generative models preserves the statistical properties of the original
dataset but, at the same time, provides perfect protection against privacy
attacks. In this work, we present the first quantitative evaluation of the
privacy gain of synthetic data publishing and compare it to that of previous
anonymisation techniques.

Our evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art generative models
demonstrates that synthetic data either does not prevent inference attacks or
does not retain data utility. In other words, we empirically show that
synthetic data suffers from the same limitations as traditional anonymisation
techniques.

Furthermore, we find that, in contrast to traditional anonymisation, the
privacy-utility tradeoff of synthetic data publishing is hard to predict.
Because it is impossible to predict what signals a synthetic dataset will
preserve and what information will be lost, synthetic data leads to a highly
variable privacy gain and unpredictable utility loss. In summary, we find that
synthetic data is far from the holy grail of privacy-preserving data
publishing.]]></summary>

areas in the robotics domain. Owing to the limitations of gathering real-world
data, i.e., sample inefficiency and the cost of collecting it, simulation
environments are utilized for training the different agents. This not only aids
in providing a potentially infinite data source, but also alleviates safety
concerns with real robots. Nonetheless, the gap between the simulated and real
worlds degrades the performance of the policies once the models are transferred
into real robots. Multiple research efforts are therefore now being directed
towards closing this sim-to-real gap and accomplish more efficient policy
transfer. Recent years have seen the emergence of multiple methods applicable
to different domains, but there is a lack, to the best of our knowledge, of a
comprehensive review summarizing and putting into context the different
methods. In this survey paper, we cover the fundamental background behind
sim-to-real transfer in deep reinforcement learning and overview the main
methods being utilized at the moment: domain randomization, domain adaptation,
imitation learning, meta-learning and knowledge distillation. We categorize
some of the most relevant recent works, and outline the main application
scenarios. Finally, we discuss the main opportunities and challenges of the

properties and in a second step to find a processing path to reach one of these
structures. In this paper, we propose and investigate a deep reinforcement
learning approach for the optimization of processing paths. The goal is to find
optimal processing paths in the material structure space that lead to
target-structures, which have been identified beforehand to result in desired
material properties. There exists a target set containing one or multiple
different structures. Our proposed methods can find an optimal path from a
start structure to a single target structure, or optimize the processing paths
to one of the equivalent target-structures in the set. In the latter case, the
algorithm learns during processing to simultaneously identify the best
reachable target structure and the optimal path to it. The proposed methods
belong to the family of model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms. They
are guided by structure representations as features of the process state and by
a reward signal, which is formulated based on a distance function in the
structure space. Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms learn through
trial and error while interacting with the process. Thereby, they are not
restricted to information from a priori sampled processing data and are able to
adapt to the specific process. The optimization itself is model-free and does
not require any prior knowledge about the process itself. We instantiate and
evaluate the proposed methods by optimizing paths of a generic metal forming
process. We show the ability of both methods to find processing paths leading
close to target structures and the ability of the extended method to identify
target-structures that can be reached effectively and efficiently and to focus
on these targets for sample efficient processing path optimization.]]></summary>

for deep neural networks (DNNs). However, these alternative normalization
layers have seen minimal use, partially due to a lack of guiding principles
that can help identify when these layers can serve as a replacement for
BatchNorm. To address this problem, we take a theoretical approach,
generalizing the known beneficial mechanisms of BatchNorm to several recently
proposed normalization techniques. Our generalized theory leads to the
following set of principles: (i) similar to BatchNorm, activations-based
normalization layers can prevent exponential growth of activations in ResNets,
but parametric layers require explicit remedies; (ii) use of GroupNorm can
ensure informative forward propagation, with different samples being assigned
dissimilar activations, but increasing group size results in increasingly
indistinguishable activations for different samples, explaining slow
convergence speed in models with LayerNorm; (iii) small group sizes result in
large gradient norm in earlier layers, hence explaining training instability
issues in Instance Normalization and illustrating a speed-stability tradeoff in
GroupNorm. Overall, our analysis reveals a unified set of mechanisms that
underpin the success of normalization methods in deep learning, providing us
with a compass to systematically explore the vast design space of DNN
normalization layers.]]></summary>

on certain subgroups, e.g., classes with few associated samples. We trace this
behaviour to errors made by the teacher distribution being transferred to and
amplified by the student model. To mitigate this problem, we present techniques
which soften the teacher influence for subgroups where it is less reliable.

generation -- an under-explored application for open-domain long text -- with
objectives in two threads: generation effectiveness and controllability. LVMs,
especially the variational autoencoder (VAE), have achieved both effective and
controllable generation through exploiting flexible distributional latent
representations. Recently, Transformers and its variants have achieved
remarkable effectiveness without explicit latent representation learning, thus
lack satisfying controllability in generation. In this paper, we advocate to
revive latent variable modeling, essentially the power of representation
learning, in the era of Transformers to enhance controllability without hurting
state-of-the-art generation effectiveness. Specifically, we integrate latent
representation vectors with a Transformer-based pre-trained architecture to
build conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). Model components such as
encoder, decoder and the variational posterior are all built on top of
pre-trained language models -- GPT2 specifically in this paper. Experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art conditional generation ability of our model, as
well as its excellent representation learning capability and controllability.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adversarial robustness of deep neural networks has been actively
investigated. However, most existing defense approaches are limited to a
specific type of adversarial perturbations. Specifically, they often fail to
offer resistance to multiple attack types simultaneously, i.e., they lack
multi-perturbation robustness. Furthermore, compared to image recognition
problems, the adversarial robustness of video recognition models is relatively
unexplored. While several studies have proposed how to generate adversarial
videos, only a handful of approaches about the defense strategies have been
published in the literature. In this paper, we propose one of the first defense
strategies against multiple types of adversarial videos for video recognition.
The proposed method, referred to as MultiBN, performs adversarial training on
multiple adversarial video types using multiple independent batch normalization
(BN) layers with a learning-based BN selection module. With a multiple BN
structure, each BN brach is responsible for learning the distribution of a
single perturbation type and thus provides more precise distribution
estimations. This mechanism benefits dealing with multiple perturbation types.
The BN selection module detects the attack type of an input video and sends it
to the corresponding BN branch, making MultiBN fully automatic and allow
end-to-end training. Compared to present adversarial training approaches, the
proposed MultiBN exhibits stronger multi-perturbation robustness against
different and even unforeseen adversarial video types, ranging from Lp-bounded
attacks and physically realizable attacks. This holds true on different
datasets and target models. Moreover, we conduct an extensive analysis to study
the properties of the multiple BN structure.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Probabilistic finite mixture models are widely used for unsupervised
clustering. These models can often be improved by adapting them to the topology
of the data. For instance, in order to classify spatially adjacent data points
similarly, it is common to introduce a Laplacian constraint on the posterior
probability that each data point belongs to a class. Alternatively, the mixing
probabilities can be treated as free parameters, while assuming Gauss-Markov or
more complex priors to regularize those mixing probabilities. However, these
approaches are constrained by the shape of the prior and often lead to
complicated or intractable inference. Here, we propose a new parametrization of
the Dirichlet distribution to flexibly regularize the mixing probabilities of
over-parametrized mixture distributions. Using the Expectation-Maximization
algorithm, we show that our approach allows us to define any linear update rule
for the mixing probabilities, including spatial smoothing regularization as a
special case. We then show that this flexible design can be extended to share
class information between multiple mixture models. We apply our algorithm to
artificial and natural image segmentation tasks, and we provide quantitative
and qualitative comparison of the performance of Gaussian and Student-t
mixtures on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset. We also demonstrate how to
propagate class information across the layers of deep convolutional neural
networks in a probabilistically optimal way, suggesting a new interpretation
for feedback signals in biological visual systems. Our flexible approach can be
easily generalized to adapt probabilistic mixture models to arbitrary data
topologies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper presents a new insight into improving the performance of
Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) by using Isolation kernel instead of
Gaussian kernel. Isolation kernel outperforms Gaussian kernel in two aspects.
First, the use of Isolation kernel in t-SNE overcomes the drawback of
misrepresenting some structures in the data, which often occurs when Gaussian
kernel is applied in t-SNE. This is because Gaussian kernel determines each
local bandwidth based on one local point only, while Isolation kernel is
derived directly from the data based on space partitioning. Second, the use of
Isolation kernel yields a more efficient similarity computation because
data-dependent Isolation kernel has only one parameter that needs to be tuned.
In contrast, the use of data-independent Gaussian kernel increases the
computational cost by determining n bandwidths for a dataset of n points. As
the root cause of these deficiencies in t-SNE is Gaussian kernel, we show that
simply replacing Gaussian kernel with Isolation kernel in t-SNE significantly
improves the quality of the final visualisation output (without creating
misrepresented structures) and removes one key obstacle that prevents t-SNE
from processing large datasets. Moreover, Isolation kernel enables t-SNE to
deal with large-scale datasets in less runtime without trading off accuracy,
unlike existing methods in speeding up t-SNE.]]></summary>

may not fully exploit the feature structure. In this paper, we incorporate the
grouping effect into MF and propose a novel method called Robust Matrix
Factorization with Grouping effect (GRMF). The grouping effect is a
generalization of the sparsity effect, which conducts denoising by clustering
similar values around multiple centers instead of just around 0. Compared with
existing algorithms, the proposed GRMF can automatically learn the grouping
structure and sparsity in MF without prior knowledge, by introducing a
naturally adjustable non-convex regularization to achieve simultaneous sparsity
and grouping effect. Specifically, GRMF uses an efficient alternating
minimization framework to perform MF, in which the original non-convex problem
is first converted into a convex problem through Difference-of-Convex (DC)
programming, and then solved by Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM). In addition, GRMF can be easily extended to the Non-negative Matrix
Factorization (NMF) settings. Extensive experiments have been conducted using
real-world data sets with outliers and contaminated noise, where the
experimental results show that GRMF has promoted performance and robustness,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a prevailing trend to study urban morphology quantitatively thanks
to the growing accessibility to various forms of spatial big data, increasing
computing power, and use cases benefiting from such information. The methods
developed up to now measure urban morphology with numerical indices describing
density, proportion, and mixture, but they do not directly represent
morphological features from the human's visual and intuitive perspective. We
take the first step to bridge the gap by proposing a deep learning-based
technique to automatically classify road networks into four classes on a visual
basis. The method is implemented by generating an image of the street network
(Colored Road Hierarchy Diagram), which we introduce in this paper, and
classifying it using a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-34). The model
achieves an overall classification accuracy of 0.875. Nine cities around the
world are selected as the study areas with their road networks acquired from
OpenStreetMap. Latent subgroups among the cities are uncovered through
clustering on the percentage of each road network category. In the subsequent
part of the paper, we focus on the usability of such classification: we apply
our method in a case study of urban vitality prediction. An advanced tree-based
regression model (LightGBM) is for the first time designated to establish the
relationship between morphological indices and vitality indicators. The effect
of road network classification is found to be small but positively associated
with urban vitality. This work expands the toolkit of quantitative urban
morphology study with new techniques, supporting further studies in the future.]]></summary>

recommendations increases trust and perceived quality. Furthermore, it gives
users an opportunity to refine the recommendations by critiquing parts of the
explanations. On one hand, current recommender systems model the
recommendation, explanation, and critiquing objectives jointly, but this
creates an inherent trade-off between their respective performance. On the
other hand, although recent latent linear critiquing approaches are built upon
an existing recommender system, they suffer from computational inefficiency at
inference due to the objective optimized at each conversation's turn. We
address these deficiencies with M&Ms-VAE, a novel variational autoencoder for
recommendation and explanation that is based on multimodal modeling
assumptions. We train the model under a weak supervision scheme to simulate
both fully and partially observed variables. Then, we leverage the
generalization ability of a trained M&Ms-VAE model to embed the user preference
and the critique separately. Our work's most important innovation is our
critiquing module, which is built upon and trained in a self-supervised manner
with a simple ranking objective. Experiments on four real-world datasets
demonstrate that among state-of-the-art models, our system is the first to
dominate or match the performance in terms of recommendation, explanation, and
multi-step critiquing. Moreover, M&Ms-VAE processes the critiques up to 25.6x
faster than the best baselines. Finally, we show that our model infers coherent
joint and cross generation, even under weak supervision, thanks to our
multimodal-based modeling and training scheme.]]></summary>

facilitate molecular property prediction, which is a fundamental task for the
drug and material industry. Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs)
have shown great promise in applying GNNs for molecular representation
learning. Moreover, a few recent studies have also demonstrated successful
applications of self-supervised learning methods to pre-train the GNNs to
overcome the problem of insufficient labeled molecules. However, existing GNNs
and pre-training strategies usually treat molecules as topological graph data
without fully utilizing the molecular geometry information. Whereas, the
three-dimensional (3D) spatial structure of a molecule, a.k.a molecular
geometry, is one of the most critical factors for determining molecular
physical, chemical, and biological properties. To this end, we propose a novel
Geometry Enhanced Molecular representation learning method (GEM) for Chemical
Representation Learning (ChemRL). At first, we design a geometry-based GNN
architecture that simultaneously models atoms, bonds, and bond angles in a
molecule. To be specific, we devised double graphs for a molecule: The first
one encodes the atom-bond relations; The second one encodes bond-angle
relations. Moreover, on top of the devised GNN architecture, we propose several
novel geometry-level self-supervised learning strategies to learn spatial
knowledge by utilizing the local and global molecular 3D structures. We compare
ChemRL-GEM with various state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines on different
molecular benchmarks and exhibit that ChemRL-GEM can significantly outperform
all baselines in both regression and classification tasks. For example, the
experimental results show an overall improvement of 8.8% on average compared to
SOTA baselines on the regression tasks, demonstrating the superiority of the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by BatchNorm, there has been an explosion of normalization layers
for deep neural networks (DNNs). However, these alternative normalization
layers have seen minimal use, partially due to a lack of guiding principles
that can help identify when these layers can serve as a replacement for
BatchNorm. To address this problem, we take a theoretical approach,
generalizing the known beneficial mechanisms of BatchNorm to several recently
proposed normalization techniques. Our generalized theory leads to the
following set of principles: (i) similar to BatchNorm, activations-based
normalization layers can prevent exponential growth of activations in ResNets,
but parametric layers require explicit remedies; (ii) use of GroupNorm can
ensure informative forward propagation, with different samples being assigned
dissimilar activations, but increasing group size results in increasingly
indistinguishable activations for different samples, explaining slow
convergence speed in models with LayerNorm; (iii) small group sizes result in
large gradient norm in earlier layers, hence explaining training instability
issues in Instance Normalization and illustrating a speed-stability tradeoff in
GroupNorm. Overall, our analysis reveals a unified set of mechanisms that
underpin the success of normalization methods in deep learning, providing us
with a compass to systematically explore the vast design space of DNN
normalization layers.]]></summary>

training are not simple problems, but often a series of difficult combinations
(wrong compensation estimation, curse of dimension, overfitting, high
complexity, etc.). In this paper, we propose a framework to decouple network
structure from operator search space, and use two BOHBs to search
alternatively. Considering that activation function and initialization are also
important parts of neural network, the generalization ability of the model will
be affected. We introduce an activation function and an initialization method
domain, and add them into the operator search space to form a generalized
search space, so as to improve the generalization ability of the child model.
We then trained a GCN-based predictor using feedback from the child model. This
can not only improve the search efficiency, but also solve the problem of
dimension curse. Next, unlike other NAS studies, we used predictors to analyze
the stability of different network structures. Finally, we applied our
framework to neural structure search and achieved significant improvements on

modelling the data generating mechanism is a fundamental problem in many
empirical sciences. Probabilistic graphical models are one common approach to
tackle the problem. Learning the graphical structure is computationally
challenging and a fervent area of current research with a plethora of
algorithms being developed. To facilitate the benchmarking of different
methods, we present a novel automated workflow, called benchpress for producing
scalable, reproducible, and platform-independent benchmarks of structure
learning algorithms for probabilistic graphical models. Benchpress is
interfaced via a simple JSON-file, which makes it accessible for all users,
while the code is designed in a fully modular fashion to enable researchers to
contribute additional methodologies. Benchpress currently provides an interface
to a large number of state-of-the-art algorithms from libraries such as BiDAG,
bnlearn, GOBNILP, pcalg, r.blip, scikit-learn, TETRAD, and trilearn as well as
a variety of methods for data generating models and performance evaluation.
Alongside user-defined models and randomly generated datasets, the software
tool also includes a number of standard datasets and graphical models from the
literature, which may be included in a benchmarking workflow. We demonstrate
the applicability of this workflow for learning Bayesian networks in four
typical data scenarios. The source code and documentation is publicly available

tasks involving both rigid bodies and fluids, where the target is specified in
a viewpoint different from what the robot operates on. When coupled with an
auto-decoding framework, it can even support goal specification from camera

information industry, technology of biological pharmacy and other fields.
Though there have been much efforts devoted to the identification of such
systems, most of the previous investigations are based on first-order gradient
algorithm which usually has much slower convergence rate than the Quasi-Newton
algorithm. Moreover, persistence of excitation(PE) conditions are usually
required to guarantee consistent parameter estimates in the existing
literature, which are hard to be verified or guaranteed for feedback control
systems. In this paper, we propose an online projected Quasi-Newton type
algorithm for parameter estimation of stochastic regression models with
binary-valued observations and varying thresholds. By using both the stochastic
Lyapunov function and martingale estimation methods, we establish the strong
consistency of the estimation algorithm and provide the convergence rate, under
a signal condition which is considerably weaker than the traditional PE
condition and coincides with the weakest possible excitation known for the
classical least square algorithm of stochastic regression models. Convergence
of adaptive predictors and their applications in adaptive control are also
discussed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Natural language is perhaps the most flexible and intuitive way for humans to
communicate tasks to a robot. Prior work in imitation learning typically
requires each task be specified with a task id or goal image -- something that
is often impractical in open-world environments. On the other hand, previous
approaches in instruction following allow agent behavior to be guided by
language, but typically assume structure in the observations, actuators, or
language that limit their applicability to complex settings like robotics. In
this work, we present a method for incorporating free-form natural language
conditioning into imitation learning. Our approach learns perception from
pixels, natural language understanding, and multitask continuous control
end-to-end as a single neural network. Unlike prior work in imitation learning,
our method is able to incorporate unlabeled and unstructured demonstration data
(i.e. no task or language labels). We show this dramatically improves language
conditioned performance, while reducing the cost of language annotation to less
than 1% of total data. At test time, a single language conditioned visuomotor
policy trained with our method can perform a wide variety of robotic
manipulation skills in a 3D environment, specified only with natural language
descriptions of each task (e.g. "open the drawer...now pick up the block...now
press the green button..."). To scale up the number of instructions an agent
can follow, we propose combining text conditioned policies with large
pretrained neural language models. We find this allows a policy to be robust to
many out-of-distribution synonym instructions, without requiring new
demonstrations. See videos of a human typing live text commands to our agent at

temperature and loading rate and indeed, sample-dependent knowledge of yield
points in structural materials promotes reliability in mechanical behavior.
Commonly, yielding is measured through controlled mechanical testing at small

deformation measurements, or by identifying plastic slip contributions. In this
paper we argue that instead of separate elastic/plastic measurements, yielding
can be unraveled through statistical analysis of total strain fluctuations
during the evolution sequence of profiles measured in-situ, through digital
image correlation. We demonstrate two distinct ways of precisely quantifying
yield locations in widely applicable crystal plasticity models, that apply in
polycrystalline solids, either by using principal component analysis or
discrete wavelet transforms. We test and compare these approaches in synthetic

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta-reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to train policies that quickly
adapt to new tasks with orders of magnitude less data than standard RL, but
this fast adaptation often comes at the cost of greatly increasing the amount
of reward supervision during meta-training time. Offline meta-RL removes the
need to continuously provide reward supervision because rewards must only be
provided once when the offline dataset is generated. In addition to the
challenges of offline RL, a unique distribution shift is present in meta RL:
agents learn exploration strategies that can gather the experience needed to
learn a new task, and also learn adaptation strategies that work well when
presented with the trajectories in the dataset, but the adaptation strategies
are not adapted to the data distribution that the learned exploration
strategies collect. Unlike the online setting, the adaptation and exploration
strategies cannot effectively adapt to each other, resulting in poor
performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid offline meta-RL algorithm,
which uses offline data with rewards to meta-train an adaptive policy, and then
collects additional unsupervised online data, without any ground truth reward
labels, to bridge this distribution shift problem. Our method uses the offline
data to learn the distribution of reward functions, which is then sampled to
self-supervise reward labels for the additional online data. By removing the
need to provide reward labels for the online experience, our approach can be
more practical to use in settings where reward supervision would otherwise be
provided manually. We compare our method to prior work on offline meta-RL on
simulated robot locomotion and manipulation tasks and find that using
additional data and self-generated rewards significantly improves an agent's
ability to generalize.]]></summary>

widely deployed in society and industry. However, the lack of transparency and
accountability of most accurate models often hinders their meaningful and safe
use. Thus, there is a clear need for developing explainable artificial
intelligence mechanisms. There exist model-agnostic methods that summarize
feature contributions, but their interpretability is limited to specific
predictions made by black-box models. An open challenge is to develop models
that have intrinsic interpretability and produce their own explanations, even
for classes of models that are traditionally considered black boxes like
(recurrent) neural networks. In this paper, we propose an LTCN-based model for
interpretable pattern classification of structured data. Our method brings its
own mechanism for providing explanations by quantifying the relevance of each
feature in the decision process. For supporting the interpretability without
affecting the performance, the model incorporates more flexibility through a
quasi-nonlinear reasoning rule that allows controlling nonlinearity. Besides,
we propose a recurrence-aware decision model that evades the issues posed by
unique fixed points while introducing a deterministic learning method to
compute the learnable parameters. The simulations show that our interpretable

level using Transformer architectures. We propose a deep neural network for

previously observed samples. Our approach outperforms a widely used wavenet
architecture by up to 9% on a similar dataset for predicting the next step.
Using the attention mechanism, we enable the architecture to learn which audio
samples are important for the prediction of the future sample. We show how
causal transformer generative models can be used for raw waveform synthesis. We
also show that this performance can be improved by another 2% by conditioning
samples over a wider context. The flexibility of the current model to
synthesize audio from latent representations suggests a large number of
potential applications. The novel approach of using generative transformer

in computer graphics applications, the 3D quality assessment (3D-QA) has become
an important task in the multimedia area. Point cloud and mesh are the two most
widely used electronic representation formats of 3D models, the quality of
which is quite sensitive to operations like simplification and compression.
Therefore, many studies concerning point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) and
mesh quality assessment (MQA) have been carried out to measure the visual
quality degradations caused by lossy operations. However, a large part of
previous studies utilizes full-reference (FR) metrics, which means they may
fail to predict the accurate quality level of 3D models when the reference 3D
model is not available. Furthermore, limited numbers of 3D-QA metrics are
carried out to take color features into consideration, which significantly
restricts the effectiveness and scope of application. In many quality
assessment studies, natural scene statistics (NSS) have shown a good ability to
quantify the distortion of natural scenes to statistical parameters. Therefore,
we propose an NSS-based no-reference quality assessment metric for colored 3D
models. In this paper, quality-aware features are extracted from the aspects of
color and geometry directly from the 3D models. Then the statistic parameters
are estimated using different distribution models to describe the
characteristic of the 3D models. Our method is mainly validated on the colored
point cloud quality assessment database (SJTU-PCQA) and the colored mesh
quality assessment database (CMDM). The experimental results show that the
proposed method outperforms all the state-of-art NR 3D-QA metrics and obtains

question answering (VQA). One drawback of softmax-based attention mechanisms is
that they assign some probability mass to all image regions, regardless of
their adjacency structure and of their relevance to the text. In this paper, to
better link the image structure with the text, we replace the traditional
softmax attention mechanism with two alternative sparsity-promoting
transformations: sparsemax, which is able to select only the relevant regions
(assigning zero weight to the rest), and a newly proposed Total-Variation
Sparse Attention (TVmax), which further encourages the joint selection of
adjacent spatial locations. Experiments in VQA show gains in accuracy as well
as higher similarity to human attention, which suggests better
interpretability.]]></summary>

federated learning (FL) in the integrated fog-cloud computing enabled
Internet-of-things (IoT) networks. In the envisioned system, IoT devices are
connected with the centralized cloud server (CS) via multiple fog access points
(F-APs). We consider two different scenarios for training the local models. In
the first scenario, local models are trained at the IoT devices and the F-APs
upload the local model parameters to the CS. In the second scenario, local
models are trained at the F-APs based on the collected data from the IoT
devices and the F-APs collaborate with the CS for updating the model
parameters. Our objective is to minimize the overall energy-consumption of both
scenarios subject to FL time constraint. Towards this goal, we devise a joint
optimization of scheduling of IoT devices with the F-APs, transmit power
allocation, computation frequency allocation at the devices and F-APs and
decouple it into two subproblems. In the first subproblem, we optimize the IoT
device scheduling and power allocation, while in the second subproblem, we
optimize the computation frequency allocation. For each scenario, we develop a
conflict graph based solution to iteratively solve the two subproblems.
Simulation results show that the proposed two schemes achieve a considerable
performance gain in terms of the energy consumption minimization. The presented
simulation results interestingly reveal that for a large number of IoT devices
and large data sizes, it is more energy efficient to train the local models at
the IoT devices instead of the F-APs.]]></summary>

screening various thoracic diseases. Automatically localizing lesions from CXR
is promising for alleviating radiologists' reading burden. However, CXR
datasets are often with massive image-level annotations and scarce lesion-level
annotations, and more often, without annotations. Thus far, unifying different
supervision granularities to develop thoracic disease detection algorithms has
not been comprehensively addressed. In this paper, we present OXnet, the first
deep omni-supervised thoracic disease detection network to our best knowledge
that uses as much available supervision as possible for CXR diagnosis. We first
introduce supervised learning via a one-stage detection model. Then, we inject
a global classification head to the detection model and propose dual attention
alignment to guide the global gradient to the local detection branch, which
enables learning lesion detection from image-level annotations. We also impose
intra-class compactness and inter-class separability with global prototype
alignment to further enhance the global information learning. Moreover, we
leverage a soft focal loss to distill the soft pseudo-labels of unlabeled data
generated by a teacher model. Extensive experiments on a large-scale chest
X-ray dataset show the proposed OXnet outperforms competitive methods with
significant margins. Further, we investigate omni-supervision under various
annotation granularities and corroborate OXnet is a promising choice to
mitigate the plight of annotation shortage for medical image diagnosis.]]></summary>

implicitly encode likelihood functions for complex systems. Classical
statistical methods are poorly suited for these so-called likelihood-free
inference (LFI) settings, outside the asymptotic and low-dimensional regimes.
Although new machine learning methods, such as normalizing flows, have
revolutionized the sample efficiency and capacity of LFI methods, it remains an
open question whether they produce reliable measures of uncertainty. In this
paper, we present a statistical framework for LFI that unifies classical
statistics with modern machine learning to: (1) construct frequentist
confidence sets and hypothesis tests with finite-sample guarantees of nominal
coverage (type I error control) and power, and (2) provide rigorous diagnostics
for assessing empirical coverage over the entire parameter space. We refer to
our framework as likelihood-free frequentist inference (LF2I). Any method that
estimates a test statistic, such as the likelihood ratio, can be plugged into
our framework to create powerful tests and confidence sets with correct
coverage. In this work, we specifically study two test statistics (ACORE and
BFF), which, respectively, maximize versus integrate an odds function over the
parameter space. Our theoretical and empirical results offer multifaceted
perspectives on error sources and challenges in likelihood-free frequentist

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Collaborative learning allows participants to jointly train a model without
data sharing. To update the model parameters, the central server broadcasts
model parameters to the clients, and the clients send updating directions such
as gradients to the server. While data do not leave a client device, the
communicated gradients and parameters will leak a client's privacy. Attacks
that infer clients' privacy from gradients and parameters have been developed
by prior work. Simple defenses such as dropout and differential privacy either
fail to defend the attacks or seriously hurt test accuracy.

We propose a practical defense which we call Double-Blind Collaborative
Learning (DBCL). The high-level idea is to apply random matrix sketching to the
parameters (aka weights) and re-generate random sketching after each iteration.
DBCL prevents clients from conducting gradient-based privacy inferences which
are the most effective attacks. DBCL works because from the attacker's
perspective, sketching is effectively random noise that outweighs the signal.
Notably, DBCL does not much increase computation and communication costs and
does not hurt test accuracy at all.]]></summary>

based software systems in many industries. Designing a DL program requires
constructing a deep neural network (DNN) and then training it on a dataset.
This process requires that developers make multiple architectural (e.g., type,
size, number, and order of layers) and configuration (e.g., optimizer,
regularization methods, and activation functions) choices that affect the
quality of the DL models, and consequently software quality. An under-specified
or poorly-designed DL model may train successfully but is likely to perform
poorly when deployed in production. Design smells in DL programs are poor
design and-or configuration decisions taken during the development of DL
components, that are likely to have a negative impact on the performance (i.e.,
prediction accuracy) and then quality of DL based software systems. In this
paper, we present a catalogue of 8 design smells for a popular DL architecture,
namely deep Feedforward Neural Networks which is widely employed in industrial
applications. The design smells were identified through a review of the
existing literature on DL design and a manual inspection of 659 DL programs
with performance issues and design inefficiencies. The smells are specified by
describing their context, consequences, and recommended refactorings. To
provide empirical evidence on the relevance and perceived impact of the
proposed design smells, we conducted a survey with 81 DL developers. In
general, the developers perceived the proposed design smells as reflective of
design or implementation problems, with agreement levels varying between 47\%

vision and language in recent years. However, most of them explicitly model the
cross-modal interaction between image-text pairs, by assuming that there exists
strong semantic correlation between the text and image modalities. Since this
strong assumption is often invalid in real-world scenarios, we choose to
implicitly model the cross-modal correlation for large-scale multi-modal
pre-training, which is the focus of the Chinese project `WenLan' led by our
team. Specifically, with the weak correlation assumption over image-text pairs,
we propose a two-tower pre-training model called BriVL within the cross-modal
contrastive learning framework. Unlike OpenAI CLIP that adopts a simple
contrastive learning method, we devise a more advanced algorithm by adapting
the latest method MoCo into the cross-modal scenario. By building a large
queue-based dictionary, our BriVL can incorporate more negative samples in
limited GPU resources. We further construct a large Chinese multi-source
image-text dataset called RUC-CAS-WenLan for pre-training our BriVL model.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the pre-trained BriVL model outperforms
both UNITER and OpenAI CLIP on various downstream tasks.]]></summary>

image analysis. Meta learning studies how learning systems can increase in
efficiency through experience and could thus evolve as an important concept to
overcome data sparsity. However, the core capability of meta learning-based
approaches is the identification of similar previous tasks given a new task - a
challenge largely unexplored in the biomedical imaging domain. In this paper,
we address the problem of quantifying task similarity with a concept that we
refer to as task fingerprinting. The concept involves converting a given task,
represented by imaging data and corresponding labels, to a fixed-length vector
representation. In fingerprint space, different tasks can be directly compared
irrespective of their data set sizes, types of labels or specific resolutions.
An initial feasibility study in the field of surgical data science (SDS) with
26 classification tasks from various medical and non-medical domains suggests
that task fingerprinting could be leveraged for both (1) selecting appropriate
data sets for pretraining and (2) selecting appropriate architectures for a new
task. Task fingerprinting could thus become an important tool for meta learning
in SDS and other fields of biomedical image analysis.]]></summary>

machines and spreading viruses. It has become a challenge for a nations
survival and hence has evolved to cyber warfare. Malware is a key component of
cyber-crime, and its analysis is the first line of defence against attack. This
work proposes a novel deep boosted hybrid learning-based malware classification
framework and named as Deep boosted Feature Space-based Malware classification
(DFS-MC). In the proposed framework, the discrimination power is enhanced by
fusing the feature spaces of the best performing customized CNN architectures
models and its discrimination by an SVM for classification. The discrimination
capacity of the proposed classification framework is assessed by comparing it
against the standard customized CNNs. The customized CNN models are implemented
in two ways: softmax classifier and deep hybrid learning-based malware
classification. In the hybrid learning, Deep features are extracted from
customized CNN architectures and fed into the conventional machine learning
classifier to improve the classification performance. We also introduced the
concept of transfer learning in a customized CNN architecture based malware
classification framework through fine-tuning. The performance of the proposed
malware classification approaches are validated on the MalImg malware dataset
using the hold-out cross-validation technique. Experimental comparisons were
conducted by employing innovative, customized CNN, trained from scratch and
fine-tuning the customized CNN using transfer learning. The proposed
classification framework DFS-MC showed improved results, Accuracy: 98.61%,
F-score: 0.96, Precision: 0.96, and Recall: 0.96.]]></summary>

practicable results when writing on normal paper. Previous approaches using
sensor-based devices encountered problems that limited the usage of the
developed systems in real-world applications. This paper presents a
writer-independent system that recognizes characters written on plain paper
with the use of a sensor-equipped pen. This system is applicable in real-world
applications and requires no user-specific training for recognition. The pen
provides linear acceleration, angular velocity, magnetic field, and force
applied by the user, and acts as a digitizer that transforms the analogue
signals of the sensors into timeseries data while writing on regular paper. The
dataset we collected with this pen consists of Latin lower-case and upper-case

called TGHop (an acronym of Texture Generation PixelHop), is proposed in this
work. Although synthesis of visually pleasant texture can be achieved by deep
neural networks, the associated models are large in size, difficult to explain
in theory, and computationally expensive in training. In contrast, TGHop is
small in its model size, mathematically transparent, efficient in training and
inference, and able to generate high quality texture. Given an exemplary
texture, TGHop first crops many sample patches out of it to form a collection
of sample patches called the source. Then, it analyzes pixel statistics of
samples from the source and obtains a sequence of fine-to-coarse subspaces for
these patches by using the PixelHop++ framework. To generate texture patches
with TGHop, we begin with the coarsest subspace, which is called the core, and
attempt to generate samples in each subspace by following the distribution of
real samples. Finally, texture patches are stitched to form texture images of a
large size. It is demonstrated by experimental results that TGHop can generate
texture images of superior quality with a small model size and at a fast speed.]]></summary>

tire-pavement friction needed for retardation and directional control and
causes potential economic and safety threats for the aviation industry during
the winter seasons. To activate appropriate safety procedures, pilots need
accurate and timely information on the actual runway surface conditions. In
this study, XGBoost is used to create a combined runway assessment system,
which includes a classifcation model to predict slippery conditions and a
regression model to predict the level of slipperiness. The models are trained
on weather data and data from runway reports. The runway surface conditions are
represented by the tire-pavement friction coefficient, which is estimated from
flight sensor data from landing aircrafts. To evaluate the performance of the
models, they are compared to several state-of-the-art runway assessment
methods. The XGBoost models identify slippery runway conditions with a ROC AUC
of 0.95, predict the friction coefficient with a MAE of 0.0254, and outperforms
all the previous methods. The results show the strong abilities of machine
learning methods to model complex, physical phenomena with a good accuracy when
domain knowledge is used in the variable extraction. The XGBoost models are
combined with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) approximations to provide a
comprehensible decision support system for airport operators and pilots, which
can contribute to safer and more economic operations of airport runways.]]></summary>

Clustering 3EC' algorithm that classifies unlabeled data into quality clusters
as a part of unsupervised learning. It offers the flexibility to explore the
context of new clusters formed by an ensemble of algorithms based on internal
validation indices.

It is worth mentioning that the input data set is considered to be a cluster
of clusters. An anomaly can possibly manifest as a cluster as well. Each
partitioned cluster is considered to be a new data set and is a candidate to
explore the most optimal algorithm and its number of partition splits until a
predefined stopping criteria is met. The algorithms independently partition the
data set into clusters and the quality of the partitioning is assessed by an
ensemble of internal cluster validation indices. The 3EC algorithm presents the
validation index scores from a choice of algorithms and its configuration of
partitions and it is called the Tau Grid. 3EC chooses the most optimal score.
The 3EC algorithm owes its name to the two input ensembles of algorithms and
internal validation indices and an output ensemble of final clusters.

Quality plays an important role in this clustering approach and it also acts
as a stopping criteria from further partitioning. Quality is determined based
on the quality of the clusters provided by an algorithm and its optimal number
of splits. The 3EC algorithm determines this from the score of the ensemble of
validation indices. The user can configure the stopping criteria by providing
quality thresholds for the score range of each of the validation indices and
the optimal size of the output cluster. The users can experiment with different
sets of stopping criteria and choose the most 'sensible group' of quality
clusters]]></summary>

of scenarios, from settings where the adversary has complete knowledge of the
model in a "white box" setting and to the opposite in a "black box" setting. In
this paper, we explore the use of output randomization as a defense against
attacks in both the black box and white box models and propose two defenses. In
the first defense, we propose output randomization at test time to thwart
finite difference attacks in black box settings. Since this type of attack
relies on repeated queries to the model to estimate gradients, we investigate
the use of randomization to thwart such adversaries from successfully creating
adversarial examples. We empirically show that this defense can limit the
success rate of a black box adversary using the Zeroth Order Optimization
attack to 0%. Secondly, we propose output randomization training as a defense
against white box adversaries. Unlike prior approaches that use randomization,
our defense does not require its use at test time, eliminating the Backward
Pass Differentiable Approximation attack, which was shown to be effective
against other randomization defenses. Additionally, this defense has low
overhead and is easily implemented, allowing it to be used together with other
defenses across various model architectures. We evaluate output randomization
training against the Projected Gradient Descent attacker and show that the
defense can reduce the PGD attack's success rate down to 12% when using
cross-entropy loss.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we propose a model-operator-data network (MOD-Net) for solving
PDEs. A MOD-Net is driven by a model to solve PDEs based on operator
representation with regularization from data. In this work, we use a deep
neural network to parameterize the Green's function. The empirical risk
consists of the mean square of the governing equation, boundary conditions, and
a few labels, which are numerically computed by traditional schemes on coarse
grid points with cheap computation cost. With only the labeled dataset or only
the model constraints, it is insufficient to accurately train a MOD-Net for
complicate problems. Intuitively, the labeled dataset works as a regularization
in addition to the model constraints. The MOD-Net is much efficient than
original neural operator because the MOD-Net also uses the information of
governing equation and the boundary conditions of the PDE rather than purely
the expensive labels. Since the MOD-Net learns the Green's function of a PDE,
it solves a type of PDEs but not a specific case. We numerically show MOD-Net
is very efficient in solving Poisson equation and one-dimensional Boltzmann
equation. For non-linear PDEs, where the concept of the Green's function does
not apply, the non-linear MOD-Net can be similarly used as an ansatz for
solving non-linear PDEs.]]></summary>

success of machine learning for many real-world tasks. Recently, an increasing
awareness has emerged that users should be given more control about how their
data is used. In particular, users should have the right to prohibit the use of
their data for training machine learning systems, and to have it erased from
already trained systems. While several sample erasure methods have been
proposed, all of them have drawbacks which have prevented them from gaining
widespread adoption. Most methods are either only applicable to very specific
families of models, sacrifice too much of the original model's accuracy, or
they have prohibitive memory or computational requirements. In this paper, we
propose an efficient and effective algorithm, SSSE, for samples erasure, that
is applicable to a wide class of machine learning models. From a second-order
analysis of the model's loss landscape we derive a closed-form update step of
the model parameters that only requires access to the data to be erased, not to
the original training set. Experiments on three datasets, CelebFaces attributes
(CelebA), Animals with Attributes 2 (AwA2) and CIFAR10, show that in certain
cases SSSE can erase samples almost as well as the optimal, yet impractical,
gold standard of training a new model from scratch with only the permitted
data.]]></summary>

relevant variation between patients or cells, by inferring unobserved hidden
states from observable high-dimensional data. A major shortcoming of current
methods, however, is their inability to learn sparse and interpretable hidden
states. Additionally, in settings where partial knowledge on the latent
structure of the data is readily available, a statistically sound integration
of prior information into current methods is challenging. To address these
issues, we propose spex-LVM, a factorial latent variable model with sparse
priors to encourage the inference of explainable factors driven by
domain-relevant information. spex-LVM utilizes existing knowledge of curated
biomedical pathways to automatically assign annotated attributes to latent
factors, yielding interpretable results tailored to the corresponding domain of
interest. Evaluations on simulated and real single-cell RNA-seq datasets
demonstrate that our model robustly identifies relevant structure in an
inherently explainable manner, distinguishes technical noise from sources of
biomedical variation, and provides dataset-specific adaptations of existing
pathway annotations. Implementation is available at

fidelity images on the class-conditional ImageNet generation challenge, without
any assistance from auxiliary image classifiers to boost sample quality. A
cascaded diffusion model comprises a pipeline of multiple diffusion models that

model at the lowest resolution, followed by one or more super-resolution
diffusion models that successively upsample the image and add higher resolution
details. We find that the sample quality of a cascading pipeline relies
crucially on conditioning augmentation, our proposed method of data
augmentation of the lower resolution conditioning inputs to the
super-resolution models. Our experiments show that conditioning augmentation
prevents compounding error during sampling in a cascaded model, helping us to
train cascading pipelines achieving FID scores of 1.48 at 64x64, 3.52 at

sample data values used to be predicted are the only correct ones. This
assumption does not hold for laboratory test data. Test results are often
within tolerable or imprecision ranges, with all values in the ranges
acceptable. By considering imprecision samples, we propose an imprecision range
loss (IR loss) method and incorporate it into Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
model for disease progress prediction. In this method, each sample in
imprecision range space has a certain probability to be the real value,
participating in the loss calculation. The loss is defined as the integral of
the error of each point in the impression range space. A sampling method for
imprecision space is formulated. The continuous imprecision space is
discretized, and a sequence of imprecise data sets are obtained, which is
convenient for gradient descent learning. A heuristic learning algorithm is
developed to learn the model parameters based on the imprecise data sets.
Experimental results on real data show that the prediction method based on IR
loss can provide more stable and consistent prediction result when test samples
are generated from imprecision range.]]></summary>

inter-pixel or inter-channel self-attention may cause excessive memory usage.
This paper proposes blur-aware attention networks (BANet) that accomplish
accurate and efficient deblurring via a single forward pass. Our BANet utilizes
region-based self-attention with multi-kernel strip pooling to disentangle blur
patterns of different degrees and with cascaded parallel dilated convolution to
aggregate multi-scale content features. Extensive experimental results on the
GoPro and HIDE benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed BANet performs
favorably against the state-of-the-art in blurred image restoration and can
provide deblurred results in real-time.]]></summary>

however, their accuracy depends on the availability of a large number of fully
segmented images. Methods to train deep neural networks using images for which
some, but not all, regions of interest are segmented are necessary to make
better use of partially annotated datasets. In this paper, we propose the first
axiomatic definition of label-set loss functions that are the loss functions
that can handle partially segmented images. We prove that there is one and only
one method to convert a classical loss function for fully segmented images into
a proper label-set loss function. Our theory also allows us to define the
leaf-Dice loss, a label-set generalization of the Dice loss particularly suited
for partial supervision with only missing labels. Using the leaf-Dice loss, we
set a new state of the art in partially supervised learning for fetal brain 3D
MRI segmentation. We achieve a deep neural network able to segment white
matter, ventricles, cerebellum, extra-ventricular CSF, cortical gray matter,
deep gray matter, brainstem, and corpus callosum based on fetal brain 3D MRI of
anatomically normal fetuses or with open spina bifida. Our implementation of
the proposed label-set loss functions is available at

it can occur to miss one or more sub-modalities for a given patient owing to
poor quality (e.g. imaging artifacts), failed acquisitions, or hallway
interrupted imaging examinations. In some cases, certain protocols are
unavailable due to limited scan time or to retrospectively harmonise the
imaging protocols of two independent studies. Missing image modalities pose a
challenge to segmentation frameworks as complementary information contributed
by the missing scans is then lost. In this paper, we propose a novel model,
Multi-modal Gaussian Process Prior Variational Autoencoder (MGP-VAE), to impute
one or more missing sub-modalities for a patient scan. MGP-VAE can leverage the
Gaussian Process (GP) prior on the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to utilize the
subjects/patients and sub-modalities correlations. Instead of designing one
network for each possible subset of present sub-modalities or using frameworks
to mix feature maps, missing data can be generated from a single model based on
all the available samples. We show the applicability of MGP-VAE on brain tumor
segmentation where either, two, or three of four sub-modalities may be missing.
Our experiments against competitive segmentation baselines with missing
sub-modality on BraTS'19 dataset indicate the effectiveness of the MGP-VAE
model for segmentation tasks.]]></summary>

attractive and meaningful field in recent years. However, in practical
application scenarios, the imbalance of time-series fault is an urgent problem
to be solved. From the perspective of Bayesian probability, this paper analyzes
how to improve the performance of imbalanced classification by adjusting the
distance between classes and the distribution within a class and proposes a
time-series fault diagnosis model based on deep metric learning. As a core of
deep metric learning, a novel quadruplet data pair design considering imbalance
class is proposed with reference to traditional deep metric learning. Based on
such data pair, this paper proposes a quadruplet loss function which takes into
account the inter-class distance and the intra-class data distribution, and
pays special attention to imbalanced sample pairs. The reasonable combination
of quadruplet loss and softmax loss function can reduce the impact of
imbalance. Experiments on two open datasets are carried out to verify the
effectiveness and robustness of the model. Experimental results show that the
proposed method can effectively improve the performance of imbalanced
classification.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Probabilistic finite mixture models are widely used for unsupervised
clustering. These models can often be improved by adapting them to the topology
of the data. For instance, in order to classify spatially adjacent data points
similarly, it is common to introduce a Laplacian constraint on the posterior
probability that each data point belongs to a class. Alternatively, the mixing
probabilities can be treated as free parameters, while assuming Gauss-Markov or
more complex priors to regularize those mixing probabilities. However, these
approaches are constrained by the shape of the prior and often lead to
complicated or intractable inference. Here, we propose a new parametrization of
the Dirichlet distribution to flexibly regularize the mixing probabilities of
over-parametrized mixture distributions. Using the Expectation-Maximization
algorithm, we show that our approach allows us to define any linear update rule
for the mixing probabilities, including spatial smoothing regularization as a
special case. We then show that this flexible design can be extended to share
class information between multiple mixture models. We apply our algorithm to
artificial and natural image segmentation tasks, and we provide quantitative
and qualitative comparison of the performance of Gaussian and Student-t
mixtures on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset. We also demonstrate how to
propagate class information across the layers of deep convolutional neural
networks in a probabilistically optimal way, suggesting a new interpretation
for feedback signals in biological visual systems. Our flexible approach can be
easily generalized to adapt probabilistic mixture models to arbitrary data
topologies.]]></summary>

contextual bandits under the realizability assumption. We propose a successive
refinement based algorithm called Adaptive Contextual Bandit ({\ttfamily ACB}),
that works in phases and successively eliminates model classes that are too
simple to fit the given instance. We prove that this algorithm is adaptive,
i.e., the regret rate order-wise matches that of {\ttfamily FALCON}, the
state-of-art contextual bandit algorithm of Levi et. al '20, that needs
knowledge of the true model class. The price of not knowing the correct model
class is only an additive term contributing to the second order term in the
regret bound. This cost possess the intuitive property that it becomes smaller
as the model class becomes easier to identify, and vice-versa. We then show
that a much simpler explore-then-commit (ETC) style algorithm also obtains a
regret rate of matching that of {\ttfamily FALCON}, despite not knowing the
true model class. However, the cost of model selection is higher in ETC as
opposed to in {\ttfamily ACB}, as expected. Furthermore, {\ttfamily ACB}
applied to the linear bandit setting with unknown sparsity, order-wise recovers
the model selection guarantees previously established by algorithms tailored to
the linear setting.]]></summary>

centered around the development of effective methods to rerank the output
hypotheses of an ASR system with more sophisticated language models (LMs) for
further gains. A current mainstream school of thoughts for ASR N-best
hypothesis reranking is to employ a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based LM or
its variants, with performance superiority over the conventional n-gram LMs
across a range of ASR tasks. In real scenarios such as a long conversation, a
sequence of consecutive sentences may jointly contain ample cues of
conversation-level information such as topical coherence, lexical entrainment
and adjacency pairs, which however remains to be underexplored. In view of
this, we first formulate ASR N-best reranking as a prediction problem, putting
forward an effective cross-sentence neural LM approach that reranks the ASR
N-best hypotheses of an upcoming sentence by taking into consideration the word
usage in its precedent sentences. Furthermore, we also explore to extract
task-specific global topical information of the cross-sentence history in an
unsupervised manner for better ASR performance. Extensive experiments conducted
on the AMI conversational benchmark corpus indicate the effectiveness and
feasibility of our methods in comparison to several state-of-the-art reranking

which typically consist of manually-designed network architectures to deliver
high-quality tracking results. Not surprisingly, the manual design process
becomes a particularly challenging barrier, as it demands sufficient prior
experience, enormous effort, intuition and perhaps some good luck. Meanwhile,
neural architecture search has gaining grounds in practical applications such
as image segmentation, as a promising method in tackling the issue of automated
search of feasible network structures. In this work, we propose a novel
cell-level differentiable architecture search mechanism to automate the network
design of the tracking module, aiming to adapt backbone features to the
objective of a tracking network during offline training. The proposed approach
is simple, efficient, and with no need to stack a series of modules to
construct a network. Our approach is easy to be incorporated into existing
trackers, which is empirically validated using different differentiable
architecture search-based methods and tracking objectives. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our approach
over five commonly-used benchmarks. Meanwhile, our automated searching process
takes 41 (18) hours for the second (first) order DARTS method on the
TrackingNet dataset.]]></summary>

it can occur to miss one or more sub-modalities for a given patient owing to
poor quality (e.g. imaging artifacts), failed acquisitions, or hallway
interrupted imaging examinations. In some cases, certain protocols are
unavailable due to limited scan time or to retrospectively harmonise the
imaging protocols of two independent studies. Missing image modalities pose a
challenge to segmentation frameworks as complementary information contributed
by the missing scans is then lost. In this paper, we propose a novel model,
Multi-modal Gaussian Process Prior Variational Autoencoder (MGP-VAE), to impute
one or more missing sub-modalities for a patient scan. MGP-VAE can leverage the
Gaussian Process (GP) prior on the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to utilize the
subjects/patients and sub-modalities correlations. Instead of designing one
network for each possible subset of present sub-modalities or using frameworks
to mix feature maps, missing data can be generated from a single model based on
all the available samples. We show the applicability of MGP-VAE on brain tumor
segmentation where either, two, or three of four sub-modalities may be missing.
Our experiments against competitive segmentation baselines with missing
sub-modality on BraTS'19 dataset indicate the effectiveness of the MGP-VAE
model for segmentation tasks.]]></summary>

verification faces on two images. However, in practical applications, those
image resolutions are usually not in the same range due to different image
capture mechanisms or sources. In this work, we first analyze the impact of
image resolutions on the face verification performance with a state-of-the-art
face recognition model. For images, synthetically reduced to $5\, \times 5\,
\mathrm{px}$ resolution, the verification performance drops from $99.23\%$
increasingly down to almost $55\%$. Especially, for cross-resolution image
pairs (one high- and one low-resolution image), the verification accuracy
decreases even further. We investigate this behavior more in-depth by looking
at the feature distances for every 2-image test pair. To tackle this problem,
we propose the following two methods: 1) Train a state-of-the-art
face-recognition model straightforward with $50\%$ low-resolution images
directly within each batch. \\ 2) Train a siamese-network structure and adding
a cosine distance feature loss between high- and low-resolution features. Both
methods show an improvement for cross-resolution scenarios and can increase the
accuracy at very low resolution to approximately $70\%$. However, a
disadvantage is that a specific model needs to be trained for every

spacetime-varying motions that are incessantly changing across both space and
time. Prior methods mainly capture the temporal state transitions but overlook
the complex spatiotemporal variations of the motion itself, making them
difficult to adapt to ever-changing motions. We observe that physical world
motions can be decomposed into transient variation and motion trend, while the
latter can be regarded as the accumulation of previous motions. Thus,
simultaneously capturing the transient variation and the motion trend is the
key to make spacetime-varying motions more predictable. Based on these
observations, we propose the MotionRNN framework, which can capture the complex
variations within motions and adapt to spacetime-varying scenarios. MotionRNN
has two main contributions. The first is that we design the MotionGRU unit,
which can model the transient variation and motion trend in a unified way. The
second is that we apply the MotionGRU to RNN-based predictive models and
indicate a new flexible video prediction architecture with a Motion Highway
that can significantly improve the ability to predict changeable motions and
avoid motion vanishing for stacked multiple-layer predictive models. With high
flexibility, this framework can adapt to a series of models for deterministic
spatiotemporal prediction. Our MotionRNN can yield significant improvements on
three challenging benchmarks for video prediction with spacetime-varying
motions.]]></summary>

ranging from connected vehicles and healthcare to industrial applications. They
rely on a large amount of interconnected sensors, which can lead to both
technical and economical challenges. Virtual sensing techniques aim to reduce
the number of physical sensors in a system by using data from available
measurements to estimate additional unknown quantities of interest. Successful
model-based solutions include Kalman filters or the combination of finite
element models and modal analysis, while many data-driven methods rely on
machine learning algorithms. The presented hybrid virtual sensing approach
combines Long Short-Term Memory networks with frequency response function
models in order to estimate the behavior of non-linear dynamic systems with
multiple input and output channels. Network training and prediction make use of
short signal subsequences, which are later recombined by applying a windowing
technique. The frequency response function model acts as a baseline estimate
which perfectly captures linear dynamic systems and is augmented by the
non-linear Long Short-Term Memory network following two different hybrid
modeling strategies. The approach is tested using a non-linear experimental
dataset, which results from measurements of a three-component servo-hydraulic
fatigue test bench. A variety of metrics in time and frequency domains, as well
as fatigue strength under variable amplitudes are used to evaluate the
approximation quality of the proposed method. In addition to virtual sensing,
the algorithm is also applied to a forward prediction task. Synthetic data are
used in a separate study to estimate the prediction quality on datasets of
different size.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning has demonstrated radiograph screening performances that are
comparable or superior to radiologists. However, recent studies show that deep
models for thoracic disease classification usually show degraded performance
when applied to external data. Such phenomena can be categorized into shortcut
learning, where the deep models learn unintended decision rules that can fit
the identically distributed training and test set but fail to generalize to
other distributions. A natural way to alleviate this defect is explicitly
indicating the lesions and focusing the model on learning the intended
features. In this paper, we conduct extensive retrospective experiments to
compare a popular thoracic disease classification model, CheXNet, and a
thoracic lesion detection model, CheXDet. We first showed that the two models
achieved similar image-level classification performance on the internal test
set with no significant differences under many scenarios. Meanwhile, we found
incorporating external training data even led to performance degradation for
CheXNet. Then, we compared the models' internal performance on the lesion
localization task and showed that CheXDet achieved significantly better
performance than CheXNet even when given 80% less training data. By further
visualizing the models' decision-making regions, we revealed that CheXNet
learned patterns other than the target lesions, demonstrating its shortcut
learning defect. Moreover, CheXDet achieved significantly better external
performance than CheXNet on both the image-level classification task and the
lesion localization task. Our findings suggest improving annotation granularity
for training deep learning systems as a promising way to elevate future deep
learning-based diagnosis systems for clinical usage.]]></summary>

generation -- an under-explored application for open-domain long text -- with
objectives in two threads: generation effectiveness and controllability. LVMs,
especially the variational autoencoder (VAE), have achieved both effective and
controllable generation through exploiting flexible distributional latent
representations. Recently, Transformers and its variants have achieved
remarkable effectiveness without explicit latent representation learning, thus
lack satisfying controllability in generation. In this paper, we advocate to
revive latent variable modeling, essentially the power of representation
learning, in the era of Transformers to enhance controllability without hurting
state-of-the-art generation effectiveness. Specifically, we integrate latent
representation vectors with a Transformer-based pre-trained architecture to
build conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). Model components such as
encoder, decoder and the variational posterior are all built on top of
pre-trained language models -- GPT2 specifically in this paper. Experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art conditional generation ability of our model, as
well as its excellent representation learning capability and controllability.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many current neural networks for medical imaging generalise poorly to data
unseen during training. Such behaviour can be caused by networks overfitting
easy-to-learn, or statistically dominant, features while disregarding other
potentially informative features. For example, indistinguishable differences in
the sharpness of the images from two different scanners can degrade the
performance of the network significantly. All neural networks intended for
clinical practice need to be robust to variation in data caused by differences
in imaging equipment, sample preparation and patient populations.

To address these challenges, we evaluate the utility of spectral decoupling
as an implicit bias mitigation method. Spectral decoupling encourages the
neural network to learn more features by simply regularising the networks'
unnormalised prediction scores with an L2 penalty, thus having no added
computational costs.

We show that spectral decoupling allows training neural networks on datasets
with strong spurious correlations. Networks trained without spectral decoupling
do not learn the original task and appear to make false predictions based on
the spurious correlations. Spectral decoupling also increases networks'
robustness for data distribution shifts. To validate our findings, we train
networks with and without spectral decoupling to detect prostate cancer tissue
slides and COVID-19 in chest radiographs. Networks trained with spectral
decoupling achieve substantially higher performance on all evaluation datasets.

Our results show that spectral decoupling helps with generalisation issues
associated with neural networks. We recommend using spectral decoupling as an
implicit bias mitigation method in any neural network intended for clinical
use.]]></summary>

explosive growth of social images with user-provided tags which continuously
arrive in a streaming fashion. Due to the fast query speed and low storage
cost, hashing-based methods for image search have attracted increasing
attention. However, existing hashing methods for social image retrieval are
based on batch mode which violates the nature of social images, i.e., social
images are usually generated periodically or collected in a stream fashion.
Although there exist many online image hashing methods, they either adopt
unsupervised learning which ignore the relevant tags, or are designed in the
supervised manner which needs high-quality labels. In this paper, to overcome
the above limitations, we propose a new method named Weakly-supervised Online
Hashing (WOH). In order to learn high-quality hash codes, WOH exploits the weak
supervision by considering the semantics of tags and removing the noise.
Besides, We develop a discrete online optimization algorithm for WOH, which is
efficient and scalable. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world
datasets demonstrate the superiority of WOH compared with several
state-of-the-art hashing baselines.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Autonomous vehicles rely heavily upon their perception subsystems to see the
environment in which they operate. Unfortunately, the effect of variable
weather conditions presents a significant challenge to object detection
algorithms, and thus it is imperative to test the vehicle extensively in all
conditions which it may experience. However, development of robust autonomous
vehicle subsystems requires repeatable, controlled testing - while real weather
is unpredictable and cannot be scheduled. Real-world testing in adverse
conditions is an expensive and time-consuming task, often requiring access to
specialist facilities. Simulation is commonly relied upon as a substitute, with
increasingly visually realistic representations of the real-world being
developed. In the context of the complete autonomous vehicle control pipeline,
subsystems downstream of perception need to be tested with accurate recreations
of the perception system output, rather than focusing on subjective visual
realism of the input - whether in simulation or the real world. This study
develops the untapped potential of a lightweight weather augmentation method in
an autonomous racing vehicle - focusing not on visual accuracy, but rather the
effect upon perception subsystem performance in real time. With minimal
adjustment, the prototype developed in this study can replicate the effects of
water droplets on the camera lens, and fading light conditions. This approach
introduces a latency of less than 8 ms using compute hardware well suited to
being carried in the vehicle - rendering it ideal for real-time implementation
that can be run during experiments in simulation, and augmented reality testing
in the real world.]]></summary>

dynamic obstacles. Instead of directly measuring the scene depth with a LiDAR
sensor, we explore the use of a much cheaper and higher resolution sensor:
programmable light curtains. Light curtains are controllable depth sensors that
sense only along a surface that a user selects. We use light curtains to
estimate the safety envelope of a scene: a hypothetical surface that separates
the robot from all obstacles. We show that generating light curtains that sense
random locations (from a particular distribution) can quickly discover the
safety envelope for scenes with unknown objects. Importantly, we produce
theoretical safety guarantees on the probability of detecting an obstacle using
random curtains. We combine random curtains with a machine learning based model
that forecasts and tracks the motion of the safety envelope efficiently. Our
method accurately estimates safety envelopes while providing probabilistic
safety guarantees that can be used to certify the efficacy of a robot
perception system to detect and avoid dynamic obstacles. We evaluate our
approach in a simulated urban driving environment and a real-world environment
with moving pedestrians using a light curtain device and show that we can
estimate safety envelopes efficiently and effectively. Project website:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Precise localization of polyp is crucial for early cancer screening in
gastrointestinal endoscopy. Videos given by endoscopy bring both richer
contextual information as well as more challenges than still images. The
camera-moving situation, instead of the common camera-fixed-object-moving one,
leads to significant background variation between frames. Severe internal
artifacts (e.g. water flow in the human body, specular reflection by tissues)
can make the quality of adjacent frames vary considerately. These factors
hinder a video-based model to effectively aggregate features from neighborhood
frames and give better predictions. In this paper, we present Spatial-Temporal
Feature Transformation (STFT), a multi-frame collaborative framework to address
these issues. Spatially, STFT mitigates inter-frame variations in the
camera-moving situation with feature alignment by proposal-guided deformable
convolutions. Temporally, STFT proposes a channel-aware attention module to
simultaneously estimate the quality and correlation of adjacent frames for
adaptive feature aggregation. Empirical studies and superior results
demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our method. For example, STFT
improves the still image baseline FCOS by 10.6% and 20.6% on the comprehensive
F1-score of the polyp localization task in CVC-Clinic and ASUMayo datasets,
respectively, and outperforms the state-of-the-art video-based method by 3.6%

features, such as colour, texture and shape, to retrieve images. In this
context, two types of image representations i.e. local and global image
features have been studied in the literature. Extracting these features from
pixel images and comparing them with images from the database is very
time-consuming. Therefore, in recent years, there has been some effort to
accomplish image analysis directly in the compressed domain with lesser
computations. Furthermore, most of the images in our daily transactions are
stored in the JPEG compressed format. Therefore, it would be ideal if we could
retrieve features directly from the partially decoded or compressed data and
use them for retrieval. Here, we propose a unified model for image retrieval
which takes DCT coefficients as input and efficiently extracts global and local
features directly in the JPEG compressed domain for accurate image retrieval.
The experimental findings indicate that our proposed model performed similarly
to the current DELG model which takes RGB features as an input with reference
to mean average precision while having a faster training and retrieval speed.]]></summary>

Learning (RL) with a Transformer-based model that learns to combine

learning-based locomotion has made great advances using RL, most methods still
rely on domain randomization for training blind agents that generalize to
challenging terrains. Our key insight is that proprioceptive states only offer
contact measurements for immediate reaction, whereas an agent equipped with
visual sensory observations can learn to proactively maneuver environments with
obstacles and uneven terrain by anticipating changes in the environment many
steps ahead. In this paper, we introduce LocoTransformer, an end-to-end RL
method for quadrupedal locomotion that leverages a Transformer-based model for
fusing proprioceptive states and visual observations. We evaluate our method in
challenging simulated environments with different obstacles and uneven terrain.
We show that our method obtains significant improvements over policies with

question answering (VQA). One drawback of softmax-based attention mechanisms is
that they assign some probability mass to all image regions, regardless of
their adjacency structure and of their relevance to the text. In this paper, to
better link the image structure with the text, we replace the traditional
softmax attention mechanism with two alternative sparsity-promoting
transformations: sparsemax, which is able to select only the relevant regions
(assigning zero weight to the rest), and a newly proposed Total-Variation
Sparse Attention (TVmax), which further encourages the joint selection of
adjacent spatial locations. Experiments in VQA show gains in accuracy as well
as higher similarity to human attention, which suggests better
interpretability.]]></summary>

signals of videos, ignoring that the semantics of moving objects and
environmental information are all critical for video-related tasks. In this
paper, we propose a novel self-supervised method for video representation
learning, referred to as Video 3D Sampling (V3S). In order to sufficiently
utilize the information (spatial and temporal) provided in videos, we
pre-process a video from three dimensions (width, height, time). As a result,
we can leverage the spatial information (the size of objects), temporal
information (the direction and magnitude of motions) as our learning target. In
our implementation, we combine the sampling of the three dimensions and propose
the scale and projection transformations in space and time respectively. The
experimental results show that, when applied to action recognition, video
retrieval and action similarity labeling, our approach improves the
state-of-the-arts with significant margins.]]></summary>

credit risk modelling is particularly challenging, as, often, the same sources
of information are not available. Therefore, it is standard policy for a loan
officer to provide a textual loan assessment to mitigate limited data
availability. In turn, this statement is analysed by a credit expert alongside
any available standard credit data. In our paper, we exploit recent advances
from the field of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP),
including the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
model, to extract information from 60 000 textual assessments provided by a
lender. We consider the performance in terms of the AUC (Area Under the
receiver operating characteristic Curve) and Brier Score metrics and find that
the text alone is surprisingly effective for predicting default. However, when
combined with traditional data, it yields no additional predictive capability,
with performance dependent on the text's length. Our proposed deep learning
model does, however, appear to be robust to the quality of the text and
therefore suitable for partly automating the mSME lending process. We also
demonstrate how the content of loan assessments influences performance, leading
us to a series of recommendations on a new strategy for collecting future mSME
loan assessments.]]></summary>

natural language processing (NLP) which encapsulates many fundamental aspects
of language understanding. With the considerable achievements of data-hungry
deep learning methods in NLP tasks, a great amount of e ort has been devoted to
develop more diverse datasets for di erent languages. In this paper, we present
a new dataset for the NLI task in the Persian language, also known as Farsi,
which is one of the dominant languages in the Middle East. This dataset, named
FarsTail, includes 10,367 samples which are provided in both the Persian
language as well as the indexed format to be useful for non-Persian
researchers. The samples are generated from 3,539 multiple-choice questions
with the least amount of annotator interventions in a way similar to the
SciTail dataset. A carefully designed multi-step process is adopted to ensure
the quality of the dataset. We also present the results of traditional and
state-of-the-art methods on FarsTail including di erent embedding methods such
as word2vec, fastText, ELMo, BERT, and LASER, as well as di erent modeling
approaches such as DecompAtt, ESIM, HBMP, and ULMFiT to provide a solid
baseline for the future research. The best obtained test accuracy is 83.38%
which shows that there is a big room for improving the current methods to be
useful for real-world NLP applications in di erent languages. We also
investigate the extent to which the models exploit super cial clues, also known
as dataset biases, in FarsTail, and partition the test set into easy and hard
subsets according to the success of biased models. The dataset is available at

address this problem, we employ attention-based multiple instance learning,
which enables us to focus on tumor-specific regions when the similarity between
cases is computed. Moreover, we employ contrastive distance metric learning to
incorporate immunohistochemical (IHC) staining patterns as useful supervised
information for defining appropriate similarity between heterogeneous malignant
lymphoma cases. In the experiment with 249 malignant lymphoma patients, we
confirmed that the proposed method exhibited higher evaluation measures than
the baseline case-based SIR methods. Furthermore, the subjective evaluation by
pathologists revealed that our similarity measure using IHC staining patterns
is appropriate for representing the similarity of H&E-stained tissue images for

research. Standard language evaluation metrics are known to be ineffective for
evaluating dialog. As such, recent research has proposed a number of novel,

fast pace of research, many of these metrics have been assessed on different
datasets and there has as yet been no time for a systematic comparison between
them. To this end, this paper provides a comprehensive assessment of recently
proposed dialog evaluation metrics on a number of datasets. In this paper, 23
different automatic evaluation metrics are evaluated on 10 different datasets.
Furthermore, the metrics are assessed in different settings, to better qualify
their respective strengths and weaknesses. Metrics are assessed (1) on both the
turn level and the dialog level, (2) for different dialog lengths, (3) for
different dialog qualities (e.g., coherence, engaging), (4) for different types
of response generation models (i.e., generative, retrieval, simple models and
state-of-the-art models), (5) taking into account the similarity of different
metrics and (6) exploring combinations of different metrics. This comprehensive
assessment offers several takeaways pertaining to dialog evaluation metrics in
general. It also suggests how to best assess evaluation metrics and indicates

which can be set by end-users to customize the sensors to specific application
scenarios. Although parameter settings significantly affect the quality of the
sensor output and the accuracy of insights derived from sensor data, most
end-users use a fixed parameter setting because they lack the skill or
understanding to appropriately configure these parameters. We propose CamTuner,
which is a system to automatically, and dynamically adapt the complex sensor to
changing environments. CamTuner includes two key components. First, a bespoke
analytics quality estimator, which is a deep-learning model to automatically
and continuously estimate the quality of insights from an analytics unit as the
environment around a sensor change. Second, a reinforcement learning (RL)
module, which reacts to the changes in quality, and automatically adjusts the
camera parameters to enhance the accuracy of insights. We improve the training
time of the RL module by an order of magnitude by designing virtual models to
mimic essential behavior of the camera: we design virtual knobs that can be set
to different values to mimic the effects of assigning different values to the
camera's configurable parameters, and we design a virtual camera model that
mimics the output from a video camera at different times of the day. These
virtual models significantly accelerate training because (a) frame rates from a
real camera are limited to 25-30 fps while the virtual models enable processing
at 300 fps, (b) we do not have to wait until the real camera sees different
environments, which could take weeks or months, and (c) virtual knobs can be
updated instantly, while it can take 200-500 ms to change the camera parameter
settings. Our dynamic tuning approach results in up to 12% improvement in the
accuracy of insights from several video analytics tasks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper presents a new insight into improving the performance of
Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) by using Isolation kernel instead of
Gaussian kernel. Isolation kernel outperforms Gaussian kernel in two aspects.
First, the use of Isolation kernel in t-SNE overcomes the drawback of
misrepresenting some structures in the data, which often occurs when Gaussian
kernel is applied in t-SNE. This is because Gaussian kernel determines each
local bandwidth based on one local point only, while Isolation kernel is
derived directly from the data based on space partitioning. Second, the use of
Isolation kernel yields a more efficient similarity computation because
data-dependent Isolation kernel has only one parameter that needs to be tuned.
In contrast, the use of data-independent Gaussian kernel increases the
computational cost by determining n bandwidths for a dataset of n points. As
the root cause of these deficiencies in t-SNE is Gaussian kernel, we show that
simply replacing Gaussian kernel with Isolation kernel in t-SNE significantly
improves the quality of the final visualisation output (without creating
misrepresented structures) and removes one key obstacle that prevents t-SNE
from processing large datasets. Moreover, Isolation kernel enables t-SNE to
deal with large-scale datasets in less runtime without trading off accuracy,

high-intensity pulsing LED illumination, we captured a primary

microscope equipped with a high-resolution (4872x3248) image sensor. In order
to suppress data distortions originating from the light interactions with
elements in the optical path, poor sensor reproduction (geometrical defects of
the camera sensor and some peculiarities of sensor sensitivity), we propose a
spectroscopic approach for the correction of this uncompressed 12-bpc data by
simultaneous calibration of all parts of the experimental arrangement.
Moreover, the final intensities of the corrected images are proportional to the
photon fluxes detected by a camera sensor. It can be visualized in 8-bpc
intensity depth after the Least Information Loss compression [Lect. Notes

because they are easy to use and can evaluate the similarities between
generated images and reference images. However, single image super-resolution
is an ill-posed problem, there are multiple corresponding high-resolution
images for the same low-resolution image. The similarities can't totally
reflect the restoration effect. The perceptual quality of generated images is
also important, but PSNR and SSIM do not reflect perceptual quality well. To
solve the problem, we proposed a method called regional differential
information entropy to measure both of the similarities and perceptual quality.
To overcome the problem that traditional image information entropy can't
reflect the structure information, we proposed to measure every region's
information entropy with sliding window. Considering that the human visual
system is more sensitive to the brightness difference at low brightness, we
take $\gamma$ quantization rather than linear quantization. To accelerate the
method, we reorganized the calculation procedure of information entropy with a
neural network. Through experiments on our IQA dataset and PIPAL, this paper
proves that RDIE can better quantify perceptual quality of images especially
GAN-based images.]]></summary>

frequently formulated as combinatorial quadratic assignment problems (QAPs)
with permutation matrix constraints, which are NP-hard. In this work, we
address such problems with emerging quantum computing technology and propose
several reformulations of QAPs as unconstrained problems suitable for efficient
execution on quantum hardware. We investigate several ways to inject
permutation matrix constraints in a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization
problem which can be mapped to quantum hardware. We focus on obtaining a
sufficient spectral gap, which further increases the probability to measure
optimal solutions and valid permutation matrices in a single run. We perform
our experiments on the quantum computer D-Wave 2000Q (2^11 qubits, adiabatic).
Despite the observed discrepancy between simulated adiabatic quantum computing
and execution on real quantum hardware, our reformulation of permutation matrix
constraints increases the robustness of the numerical computations over other
penalty approaches in our experiments. The proposed algorithm has the potential
to scale to higher dimensions on future quantum computing architectures, which
opens up multiple new directions for solving matching problems in 3D computer

loose coupling of direct visual localization and Inertial Measurement Unit

framework, dynamic objects not captured in the 3D environment map are
instantiated based on the input images. Finally, a scene rendering component
synthesizes a first-person view with identification (ID) textures and performs
direct 2D-3D gaze association. Quantitative evaluations showed the

verification faces on two images. However, in practical applications, those
image resolutions are usually not in the same range due to different image
capture mechanisms or sources. In this work, we first analyze the impact of
image resolutions on the face verification performance with a state-of-the-art
face recognition model. For images, synthetically reduced to $5\, \times 5\,
\mathrm{px}$ resolution, the verification performance drops from $99.23\%$
increasingly down to almost $55\%$. Especially, for cross-resolution image
pairs (one high- and one low-resolution image), the verification accuracy
decreases even further. We investigate this behavior more in-depth by looking
at the feature distances for every 2-image test pair. To tackle this problem,
we propose the following two methods: 1) Train a state-of-the-art
face-recognition model straightforward with $50\%$ low-resolution images
directly within each batch. \\ 2) Train a siamese-network structure and adding
a cosine distance feature loss between high- and low-resolution features. Both
methods show an improvement for cross-resolution scenarios and can increase the
accuracy at very low resolution to approximately $70\%$. However, a
disadvantage is that a specific model needs to be trained for every

in the post-implantation CT (Post-CT) images of cochlear implant (CI)
recipients that preserves the point-to-point correspondence between the meshes

challenging because of the strong artifacts produced by the implant, we use a
pair of co-trained deep networks that generate dense deformation fields (DDFs)
in opposite directions. One network is tasked with registering an atlas image
to the Post-CT images and the other network is tasked with registering the
Post-CT images to the atlas image. The networks are trained using loss
functions based on voxel-wise labels, image content, fiducial registration
error, and cycle-consistency constraint. The segmentation of the ICA in the
Post-CT images is subsequently obtained by transferring the predefined
segmentation meshes of the ICA in the atlas image to the Post-CT images using
the corresponding DDFs generated by the trained registration networks. Our
model can learn the underlying geometric features of the ICA even though they
are obscured by the metal artifacts. We show that our end-to-end network
produces results that are comparable to the current state of the art (SOTA)
that relies on a two-steps approach that first uses conditional generative
adversarial networks to synthesize artifact-free images from the Post-CT images

for partial supervision with only missing labels. Using the leaf-Dice loss, we
set a new state of the art in partially supervised learning for fetal brain 3D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Online continual learning aims to learn from a non-IID stream of data from a
number of different tasks, where the learner is only allowed to consider data
once. Methods are typically allowed to use a limited buffer to store some of
the images in the stream. Recently, it was found that feature replay, where an
intermediate layer representation of the image is stored (or generated) leads
to superior results than image replay, while requiring less memory. Quantized
exemplars can further reduce the memory usage. However, a drawback of these
methods is that they use a fixed (or very intransigent) backbone network. This
significantly limits the learning of representations that can discriminate
between all tasks. To address this problem, we propose an auxiliary classifier
auto-encoder (ACAE) module for feature replay at intermediate layers with high
compression rates. The reduced memory footprint per image allows us to save
more exemplars for replay. In our experiments, we conduct task-agnostic
evaluation under online continual learning setting and get state-of-the-art
performance on ImageNet-Subset, CIFAR100 and CIFAR10 dataset.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video-based human pose estimation (HPE) is a vital yet challenging task.
While deep learning methods have made significant progress for the HPE, most
approaches to this task detect each joint independently, damaging the pose
structural information. In this paper, unlike the prior methods, we propose a
Relation-based Pose Semantics Transfer Network (RPSTN) to locate joints
associatively. Specifically, we design a lightweight joint relation extractor
(JRE) to model the pose structural features and associatively generate heatmaps
for joints by modeling the relation between any two joints heuristically
instead of building each joint heatmap independently. Actually, the proposed
JRE module models the spatial configuration of human poses through the
relationship between any two joints. Moreover, considering the temporal
semantic continuity of videos, the pose semantic information in the current
frame is beneficial for guiding the location of joints in the next frame.
Therefore, we use the idea of knowledge reuse to propagate the pose semantic
information between consecutive frames. In this way, the proposed RPSTN
captures temporal dynamics of poses. On the one hand, the JRE module can infer
invisible joints according to the relationship between the invisible joints and
other visible joints in space. On the other hand, in the time, the propose
model can transfer the pose semantic features from the non-occluded frame to
the occluded frame to locate occluded joints. Therefore, our method is robust
to the occlusion and achieves state-of-the-art results on the two challenging
datasets, which demonstrates its effectiveness for video-based human pose
estimation. We will release the code and models publicly.]]></summary>

represent visual data of multiple dimensions. Inherently able to efficiently
capture structured, latent semantic spaces and high-order interactions, tensors
have a long history of applications in a wide span of computer vision problems.
With the advent of the deep learning paradigm shift in computer vision, tensors
have become even more fundamental. Indeed, essential ingredients in modern deep
learning architectures, such as convolutions and attention mechanisms, can
readily be considered as tensor mappings. In effect, tensor methods are
increasingly finding significant applications in deep learning, including the
design of memory and compute efficient network architectures, improving
robustness to random noise and adversarial attacks, and aiding the theoretical
understanding of deep networks.

This article provides an in-depth and practical review of tensors and tensor
methods in the context of representation learning and deep learning, with a
particular focus on visual data analysis and computer vision applications.
Concretely, besides fundamental work in tensor-based visual data analysis
methods, we focus on recent developments that have brought on a gradual
increase of tensor methods, especially in deep learning architectures, and
their implications in computer vision applications. To further enable the
newcomer to grasp such concepts quickly, we provide companion Python notebooks,

While unlabeled point clouds can be easily obtained from sensors or

Additionally, we propose an edge prediction module to constrain the features

research is improving in performance along with the development of deep
learning. However, for improved performance, not only past images but also
future images should be used along with corresponding facial images, but there
are obstacles to the application of this technique to real-time environments.
In this paper, we propose the causal affect prediction network (CAPNet), which
uses only past facial images to predict corresponding affective valence and

corresponding affective valence and arousal through supervised learning by
pairing the sequence of past images with the current label using the Aff-Wild2
dataset. We show through experiments that the well-trained CAPNet outperforms
the baseline of the second challenge of the Affective Behavior Analysis
in-the-wild (ABAW2) Competition by predicting affective valence and arousal
only with past facial images one-third of a second earlier. Therefore, in
real-time application, CAPNet can reliably predict affective valence and

training are not simple problems, but often a series of difficult combinations
(wrong compensation estimation, curse of dimension, overfitting, high

structure from operator search space, and use two BOHBs to search
alternatively. Considering that activation function and initialization are also
important parts of neural network, the generalization ability of the model will
be affected. We introduce an activation function and an initialization method
domain, and add them into the operator search space to form a generalized
search space, so as to improve the generalization ability of the child model.
We then trained a GCN-based predictor using feedback from the child model. This
can not only improve the search efficiency, but also solve the problem of
dimension curse. Next, unlike other NAS studies, we used predictors to analyze
the stability of different network structures. Finally, we applied our
framework to neural structure search and achieved significant improvements on

visual understanding - the former provides sparse but accurate locations of
points on objects, while the latter contains dense color and texture
information. Despite this potential for close sensor fusion, many methods train
two models in isolation and use simple feature concatenation to represent 3D
sensor data. This separated training scheme results in potentially sub-optimal
performance and prevents 3D tasks from being used to benefit 2D tasks that are
often useful on their own. To provide a more integrated approach, we propose a
novel Multi-Modality Task Cascade network (MTC-RCNN) that leverages 3D box
proposals to improve 2D segmentation predictions, which are then used to
further refine the 3D boxes. We show that including a 2D network between two
stages of 3D modules significantly improves both 2D and 3D task performance.
Moreover, to prevent the 3D module from over-relying on the overfitted 2D
predictions, we propose a dual-head 2D segmentation training and inference
scheme, allowing the 2nd 3D module to learn to interpret imperfect 2D
segmentation predictions. Evaluating our model on the challenging SUN RGB-D
dataset, we improve upon state-of-the-art results of both single modality and
fusion networks by a large margin ($\textbf{+3.8}$ mAP@0.5). Code will be

are from different domains. While this problem can be mitigated by using the
target domain data to align the source and target domain feature
representations, the target domain data may be unavailable due to privacy
concerns. Consequently, there is a need for methods that generalize well
without access to target domain data during training. In this work, we propose
an adversarial hallucination approach, which combines a class-wise
hallucination module and a semantic segmentation module. Since the segmentation
performance varies across different classes, we design a semantic-conditioned
style hallucination layer to adaptively stylize each class. The classwise
stylization parameters are generated from the semantic knowledge in the
segmentation probability maps of the source domain image. Both modules compete
adversarially, with the hallucination module generating increasingly
'difficult' style images to challenge the segmentation module. In response, the
segmentation module improves its performance as it is trained with generated
samples at an appropriate class-wise difficulty level. Experiments on state of

which typically consist of manually-designed network architectures to deliver
high-quality tracking results. Not surprisingly, the manual design process
becomes a particularly challenging barrier, as it demands sufficient prior
experience, enormous effort, intuition and perhaps some good luck. Meanwhile,
neural architecture search has gaining grounds in practical applications such
as image segmentation, as a promising method in tackling the issue of automated
search of feasible network structures. In this work, we propose a novel
cell-level differentiable architecture search mechanism to automate the network
design of the tracking module, aiming to adapt backbone features to the
objective of a tracking network during offline training. The proposed approach
is simple, efficient, and with no need to stack a series of modules to
construct a network. Our approach is easy to be incorporated into existing
trackers, which is empirically validated using different differentiable
architecture search-based methods and tracking objectives. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our approach
over five commonly-used benchmarks. Meanwhile, our automated searching process
takes 41 (18) hours for the second (first) order DARTS method on the

segmentation of the heart is essential for detailed description of its
anatomical structures. However, due to the limit of acquisition duration and
respiratory/cardiac motion, stacks of multi-slice 2D images are acquired in
clinical routine. The segmentation of these images provides a low-resolution
representation of cardiac anatomy, which may contain artefacts caused by
motion. Here we propose a novel latent optimisation framework that jointly
performs motion correction and super resolution for cardiac image
segmentations. Given a low-resolution segmentation as input, the framework
accounts for inter-slice motion in cardiac MR imaging and super-resolves the
input into a high-resolution segmentation consistent with input. A multi-view
loss is incorporated to leverage information from both short-axis view and
long-axis view of cardiac imaging. To solve the inverse problem, iterative
optimisation is performed in a latent space, which ensures the anatomical
plausibility. This alleviates the need of paired low-resolution and
high-resolution images for supervised learning. Experiments on two cardiac MR
datasets show that the proposed framework achieves high performance, comparable
to state-of-the-art super-resolution approaches and with better cross-domain
generalisability and anatomical plausibility.]]></summary>

CNNs for video understanding. However, due to their large number of parameters
and reduced inductive biases, these models require supervised pretraining on
large-scale image datasets to achieve top performance. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that self-supervised pretraining of video transformers
on video-only datasets can lead to action recognition results that are on par
or better than those obtained with supervised pretraining on large-scale image
datasets, even massive ones such as ImageNet-21K. Since transformer-based
models are effective at capturing dependencies over extended temporal spans, we
propose a simple learning procedure that forces the model to match a long-term
view to a short-term view of the same video. Our approach, named Long-Short
Temporal Contrastive Learning (LSTCL), enables video transformers to learn an
effective clip-level representation by predicting temporal context captured
from a longer temporal extent. To demonstrate the generality of our findings,
we implement and validate our approach under three different self-supervised
contrastive learning frameworks (MoCo v3, BYOL, SimSiam) using two distinct
video-transformer architectures, including an improved variant of the Swin
Transformer augmented with space-time attention. We conduct a thorough ablation
study and show that LSTCL achieves competitive performance on multiple video

communicate tasks to a robot. Prior work in imitation learning typically
requires each task be specified with a task id or goal image -- something that
is often impractical in open-world environments. On the other hand, previous
approaches in instruction following allow agent behavior to be guided by
language, but typically assume structure in the observations, actuators, or
language that limit their applicability to complex settings like robotics. In
this work, we present a method for incorporating free-form natural language
conditioning into imitation learning. Our approach learns perception from
pixels, natural language understanding, and multitask continuous control
end-to-end as a single neural network. Unlike prior work in imitation learning,
our method is able to incorporate unlabeled and unstructured demonstration data
(i.e. no task or language labels). We show this dramatically improves language
conditioned performance, while reducing the cost of language annotation to less
than 1% of total data. At test time, a single language conditioned visuomotor
policy trained with our method can perform a wide variety of robotic
manipulation skills in a 3D environment, specified only with natural language
descriptions of each task (e.g. "open the drawer...now pick up the block...now
press the green button..."). To scale up the number of instructions an agent
can follow, we propose combining text conditioned policies with large
pretrained neural language models. We find this allows a policy to be robust to
many out-of-distribution synonym instructions, without requiring new
demonstrations. See videos of a human typing live text commands to our agent at

classification. In the hybrid learning, Deep features are extracted from
customized CNN architectures and fed into the conventional machine learning
classifier to improve the classification performance. We also introduced the
concept of transfer learning in a customized CNN architecture based malware
classification framework through fine-tuning. The performance of the proposed
malware classification approaches are validated on the MalImg malware dataset

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Human motion prediction is essential for tasks such as human motion analysis
and human-robot interactions. Most existing approaches have been proposed to
realize motion prediction. However, they ignore an important task, the
evaluation of the quality of the predicted result. It is far more enough for
current approaches in actual scenarios because people can't know how to
interact with the machine without the evaluation of prediction, and unreliable
predictions may mislead the machine to harm the human. Hence, we propose an
uncertainty-aware framework for human motion prediction (UA-HMP). Concretely,
we first design an uncertainty-aware predictor through Gaussian modeling to
achieve the value and the uncertainty of predicted motion. Then, an
uncertainty-guided learning scheme is proposed to quantitate the uncertainty
and reduce the negative effect of the noisy samples during optimization for
better performance. Our proposed framework is easily combined with current SOTA
baselines to overcome their weakness in uncertainty modeling with slight
parameters increment. Extensive experiments also show that they can achieve
better performance in both short and long-term predictions in H3.6M, CMU-Mocap.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crowd counting is critical for numerous video surveillance scenarios. One of
the main issues in this task is how to handle the dramatic scale variations of
pedestrians caused by the perspective effect. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel convolution neural network-based crowd counting method, termed
Perspective-guided Fractional-Dilation Network (PFDNet). By modeling the
continuous scale variations, the proposed PFDNet is able to select the proper
fractional dilation kernels for adapting to different spatial locations. It
significantly improves the flexibility of the state-of-the-arts that only
consider the discrete representative scales. In addition, by avoiding the
multi-scale or multi-column architecture that used in other methods, it is
computationally more efficient. In practice, the proposed PFDNet is constructed
by stacking multiple Perspective-guided Fractional-Dilation Convolutions (PFC)
on a VGG16-BN backbone. By introducing a novel generalized dilation convolution
operation, the PFC can handle fractional dilation ratios in the spatial domain
under the guidance of perspective annotations, achieving continuous scales
modeling of pedestrians. To deal with the problem of unavailable perspective
information in some cases, we further introduce an effective perspective
estimation branch to the proposed PFDNet, which can be trained in either
supervised or weakly-supervised setting once the branch has been pre-trained.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed PFDNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on ShanghaiTech A, ShanghaiTech B, WorldExpo'10,
UCF-QNRF, UCF_CC_50 and TRANCOS dataset, achieving MAE 53.8, 6.5, 6.8, 84.3,

applications, such as video retrieval and browsing, require compact
representations that are addressed by the video summarization literature.
Current supervised studies formulate video summarization as a

the surge of human-centric view, which inherently contains affective content.
In this study, we investigate the affective-information enriched supervised
video summarization task for human-centric videos. First, we train a visual
input-driven state-of-the-art continuous emotion recognition model (CER-NET) on
the RECOLA dataset to estimate emotional attributes. Then, we integrate the
estimated emotional attributes and the high-level representations from the
CER-NET with the visual information to define the proposed affective video
summarization architectures (AVSUM). In addition, we investigate the use of
attention to improve the AVSUM architectures and propose two new architectures
based on temporal attention (TA-AVSUM) and spatial attention (SA-AVSUM). We
conduct video summarization experiments on the TvSum database. The proposed
AVSUM-GRU architecture with an early fusion of high level GRU embeddings and
the temporal attention based TA-AVSUM architecture attain competitive video
summarization performances by bringing strong performance improvements for the
human-centric videos compared to the state-of-the-art in terms of F-score and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adversarial robustness of deep neural networks has been actively
investigated. However, most existing defense approaches are limited to a
specific type of adversarial perturbations. Specifically, they often fail to
offer resistance to multiple attack types simultaneously, i.e., they lack
multi-perturbation robustness. Furthermore, compared to image recognition
problems, the adversarial robustness of video recognition models is relatively
unexplored. While several studies have proposed how to generate adversarial
videos, only a handful of approaches about the defense strategies have been
published in the literature. In this paper, we propose one of the first defense
strategies against multiple types of adversarial videos for video recognition.
The proposed method, referred to as MultiBN, performs adversarial training on
multiple adversarial video types using multiple independent batch normalization
(BN) layers with a learning-based BN selection module. With a multiple BN
structure, each BN brach is responsible for learning the distribution of a
single perturbation type and thus provides more precise distribution
estimations. This mechanism benefits dealing with multiple perturbation types.
The BN selection module detects the attack type of an input video and sends it
to the corresponding BN branch, making MultiBN fully automatic and allow
end-to-end training. Compared to present adversarial training approaches, the
proposed MultiBN exhibits stronger multi-perturbation robustness against
different and even unforeseen adversarial video types, ranging from Lp-bounded
attacks and physically realizable attacks. This holds true on different
datasets and target models. Moreover, we conduct an extensive analysis to study
the properties of the multiple BN structure.]]></summary>

goal. A growing body of research directs this goal towards augmenting the
creative writing abilities of human authors. In this paper, we pursue this
objective by analyzing how observing examples of automatically generated text
influences writing. In particular, we examine a task referred to as sentence
infilling, which involves transforming a list of words into a complete
sentence. We emphasize "storiability" as a desirable feature of the resulting
sentences, where "storiable" sentences are those that suggest a story a reader
would be curious to hear about. Both humans and an automated system (based on a
neural language model) performed this sentence infilling task. In one setting,
people wrote sentences on their own; in a different setting, people observed
the sentences produced by the model while writing their own sentences. Readers
then assigned storiability preferences to the resulting sentences in a
subsequent evaluation. We find that human-authored sentences were judged as
more storiable when authors observed the generated examples, and that
storiability increased as authors derived more semantic content from the
examples. This result gives evidence of an "inspiration through observation"
paradigm for human-computer collaborative writing, through which human writing
can be enhanced by text generation models without directly copying their

importance of different salient objects. Recently, two works have been proposed
to detect saliency ranking by assigning different degrees of saliency to
different objects. However, one of these models cannot differentiate object
instances and the other focuses more on sequential attention shift order
inference. In this paper, we investigate a practical problem setting that
requires simultaneously segment salient instances and infer their relative
saliency rank order. We present a novel unified model as the first end-to-end
solution, where an improved Mask R-CNN is first used to segment salient
instances and a saliency ranking branch is then added to infer the relative
saliency. For relative saliency ranking, we build a new graph reasoning module
by combining four graphs to incorporate the instance interaction relation,
local contrast, global contrast, and a high-level semantic prior, respectively.
A novel loss function is also proposed to effectively train the saliency
ranking branch. Besides, a new dataset and an evaluation metric are proposed
for this task, aiming at pushing forward this field of research. Finally,
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model is more effective than
previous methods. We also show an example of its practical usage on adaptive

to the growing accessibility to various forms of spatial big data, increasing
computing power, and use cases benefiting from such information. The methods
developed up to now measure urban morphology with numerical indices describing
density, proportion, and mixture, but they do not directly represent
morphological features from the human's visual and intuitive perspective. We
take the first step to bridge the gap by proposing a deep learning-based
technique to automatically classify road networks into four classes on a visual
basis. The method is implemented by generating an image of the street network
(Colored Road Hierarchy Diagram), which we introduce in this paper, and
classifying it using a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-34). The model
achieves an overall classification accuracy of 0.875. Nine cities around the
world are selected as the study areas with their road networks acquired from
OpenStreetMap. Latent subgroups among the cities are uncovered through
clustering on the percentage of each road network category. In the subsequent
part of the paper, we focus on the usability of such classification: we apply
our method in a case study of urban vitality prediction. An advanced tree-based
regression model (LightGBM) is for the first time designated to establish the
relationship between morphological indices and vitality indicators. The effect
of road network classification is found to be small but positively associated
with urban vitality. This work expands the toolkit of quantitative urban
morphology study with new techniques, supporting further studies in the future.]]></summary>

weights in overparameterized networks. Most of the existing techniques first
remove structured sub-networks (filters, channels,...) and then fine-tune the
resulting networks to maintain a high accuracy. However, removing a whole
structure is a strong topological prior and recovering the accuracy, with
fine-tuning, is highly cumbersome. In this paper, we introduce an "end-to-end"
lightweight network design that achieves training and pruning simultaneously
without fine-tuning. The design principle of our method relies on
reparametrization that learns not only the weights but also the topological
structure of the lightweight sub-network. This reparametrization acts as a
prior (or regularizer) that defines pruning masks implicitly from the weights
of the underlying network, without increasing the number of training
parameters. Sparsity is induced with a budget loss that provides an accurate
pruning. Extensive experiments conducted on the CIFAR10 and the TinyImageNet
datasets, using standard architectures (namely Conv4, VGG19 and ResNet18), show
compelling results without fine-tuning.]]></summary>

resulting in downlinking of terabytes of data each day. The data received by
ground stations is often unprocessed, making this an expensive process
considering the large data sizes and that not all of the data is useful. This,
coupled with the increasing demand for real-time data processing, has led to a
growing need for on-orbit processing solutions. In this work, we investigate
the performance of CNN-based object detectors on constrained devices by
applying different image compression techniques to satellite data. We examine
the capabilities of the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier;
low-power, high-performance computers, with integrated GPUs, small enough to
fit on-board a nanosatellite. We take a closer look at object detection
networks, including the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and Region-based
Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN) models that are pre-trained on DOTA - a
Large Scale Dataset for Object Detection in Aerial Images. The performance is
measured in terms of execution time, memory consumption, and accuracy, and are
compared against a baseline containing a server with two powerful GPUs. The
results show that by applying image compression techniques, we are able to
improve the execution time and memory consumption, achieving a fully runnable
dataset. A lossless compression technique achieves roughly a 10% reduction in
execution time and about a 3% reduction in memory consumption, with no impact
on the accuracy. While a lossy compression technique improves the execution
time by up to 144% and the memory consumption is reduced by as much as 97%.
However, it has a significant impact on accuracy, varying depending on the
compression ratio. Thus the application and ratio of these compression
techniques may differ depending on the required level of accuracy for a
particular task.]]></summary>

unpredictability when dealing with flammable or hazardous materials so that
detection of fire accidents by itself may not be enough. An example of this is
the impingement of jet fires, where the heat fluxes of the flame could reach
nearby equipment and dramatically increase the probability of a domino effect
with catastrophic results. Because of this, the characterization of such fire
accidents is important from a risk management point of view. One such
characterization would be the segmentation of different radiation zones within
the flame, so this paper presents an exploratory research regarding several
traditional computer vision and Deep Learning segmentation approaches to solve
this specific problem. A data set of propane jet fires is used to train and
evaluate the different approaches and given the difference in the distribution
of the zones and background of the images, different loss functions, that seek
to alleviate data imbalance, are also explored. Additionally, different metrics
are correlated to a manual ranking performed by experts to make an evaluation
that closely resembles the expert's criteria. The Hausdorff Distance and
Adjsted Random Index were the metrics with the highest correlation and the best
results were obtained from the UNet architecture with a Weighted Cross-Entropy
Loss. These results can be used in future research to extract more geometric
information from the segmentation masks or could even be implemented on other
types of fire accidents.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the data scale grows, deep recognition models often suffer from
long-tailed data distributions due to the heavy imbalanced sample number across
categories. Indeed, real-world data usually exhibit some similarity relation
among different categories (e.g., pigeons and sparrows), called category
similarity in this work. It is doubly difficult when the imbalance occurs
between such categories with similar appearances. However, existing solutions
mainly focus on the sample number to re-balance data distribution. In this
work, we systematically investigate the essence of the long-tailed problem from
a unified perspective. Specifically, we demonstrate that long-tailed
recognition suffers from both sample number and category similarity.
Intuitively, using a toy example, we first show that sample number is not the
unique influence factor for performance dropping of long-tailed recognition.
Theoretically, we demonstrate that (1) category similarity, as an inevitable
factor, would also influence the model learning under long-tailed distribution
via similar samples, (2) using more discriminative representation methods
(e.g., self-supervised learning) for similarity reduction, the classifier bias
can be further alleviated with greatly improved performance. Extensive
experiments on several long-tailed datasets verify the rationality of our
theoretical analysis, and show that based on existing state-of-the-arts
(SOTAs), the performance could be further improved by similarity reduction. Our
investigations highlight the essence behind the long-tailed problem, and claim
several feasible directions for future work.]]></summary>

many applications in the fields of robot learning and autonomous driving. This
paper reveals novel geometric laws of optical flow based on the insight and
detailed definition of non-occlusion. Then, two novel loss functions are
proposed for the unsupervised learning of optical flow based on the geometric
laws of non-occlusion. Specifically, after the occlusion part of the images are
masked, the flowing process of pixels is carefully considered and geometric
constraints are conducted based on the geometric laws of optical flow. First,
neighboring pixels in the first frame will not intersect during the pixel
displacement to the second frame. Secondly, when the cluster containing
adjacent four pixels in the first frame moves to the second frame, no other
pixels will flow into the quadrilateral formed by them. According to the two
geometrical constraints, the optical flow non-intersection loss and the optical
flow non-blocking loss in the non-occlusion regions are proposed. Two loss
functions punish the irregular and inexact optical flows in the non-occlusion
regions. The experiments on datasets demonstrated that the proposed
unsupervised losses of optical flow based on the geometric laws in
non-occlusion regions make the estimated optical flow more refined in detail,
and improve the performance of unsupervised learning of optical flow. In
addition, the experiments training on synthetic data and evaluating on real
data show that the generalization ability of optical flow network is improved
by our proposed unsupervised approach.]]></summary>

researchers and have since been successfully employed for several problems
traditionally addressed with convolutional neural networks. At the same time,
image synthesis using generative adversarial networks (GANs) has drastically
improved over the last few years. The recently proposed TransGAN is the first
GAN using only transformer-based architectures and achieves competitive results
when compared to convolutional GANs. However, since transformers are
data-hungry architectures, TransGAN requires data augmentation, an auxiliary
super-resolution task during training, and a masking prior to guide the
self-attention mechanism. In this paper, we study the combination of a
transformer-based generator and convolutional discriminator and successfully
remove the need of the aforementioned required design choices. We evaluate our
approach by conducting a benchmark of well-known CNN discriminators, ablate the
size of the transformer-based generator, and show that combining both
architectural elements into a hybrid model leads to better results.
Furthermore, we investigate the frequency spectrum properties of generated
images and observe that our model retains the benefits of an attention based
generator.]]></summary>

pneumonia has caused millions of deaths worldwide. Automatically segmenting
lesions from chest Computed Tomography (CT) is a promising way to assist
doctors in COVID-19 screening, treatment planning, and follow-up monitoring.
However, voxel-wise annotations are extremely expert-demanding and scarce,

Specifically, we present a dual-consistency learning scheme that simultaneously
imposes image transformation equivalence and feature perturbation invariance to
effectively harness the knowledge from unlabeled data. We then quantify the
segmentation uncertainty in two forms and employ them together to guide the
consistency regularization for more reliable unsupervised learning. Extensive

DistilBert and reasons among the objects in the 3D scene to find the target
object. We show that our model performs competitively on visio-linguistic
datasets proposed by ReferIt3D. We provide additional analysis of performance
in spatial reasoning tasks decoupled from perception noise, the effect of
view-dependent utterances in terms of accuracy, and view-point annotations for

request and process an increasing variety of sensitive personal information.
The accurate disclosure of sensitive information is essential where it is used
to provide advice and support to users in the healthcare and finance sectors.
In this study, we explore users' concerns regarding factors associated with the
use of sensitive data by chatbot providers. We surveyed a representative sample
of 491 British citizens. Our results show that the user concerns focus on
deleting personal information and concerns about their data's inappropriate
use. We also identified that individuals were concerned about losing control
over their data after a conversation with conversational agents. We found no
effect from a user's gender or education but did find an effect from the user's
age, with those over 45 being more concerned than those under 45. We also
considered the factors that engender trust in a chatbot. Our respondents'
primary focus was on the chatbot's technical elements, with factors such as the
response quality being identified as the most critical factor. We again found
no effect from the user's gender or education level; however, when we
considered some social factors (e.g. avatars or perceived 'friendliness'), we
found those under 45 years old rated these as more important than those over
45. The paper concludes with a discussion of these results within the context
of designing inclusive, digital systems that support a wide range of users.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In medical image segmentation, it is difficult to mark ambiguous areas
accurately with binary masks, especially when dealing with small lesions.
Therefore, it is a challenge for radiologists to reach a consensus by using
binary masks under the condition of multiple annotations. However, these areas
may contain anatomical structures that are conducive to diagnosis. Uncertainty
is introduced to study these situations. Nevertheless, the uncertainty is
usually measured by the variances between predictions in a multiple trial way.
It is not intuitive, and there is no exact correspondence in the image.
Inspired by image matting, we introduce matting as a soft segmentation method
and a new perspective to deal with and represent uncertain regions into medical
scenes, namely medical matting. More specifically, because there is no
available medical matting dataset, we first labeled two medical datasets with
alpha matte. Secondly, the matting method applied to the natural image is not
suitable for the medical scene, so we propose a new architecture to generate
binary masks and alpha matte in a row. Thirdly, the uncertainty map is
introduced to highlight the ambiguous regions from the binary results and
improve the matting performance. Evaluated on these datasets, the proposed
model outperformed state-of-the-art matting algorithms by a large margin, and
alpha matte is proved to be a more efficient labeling form than a binary mask.]]></summary>

however, a thorough survey reporting previous work and recent advances is yet
to be done. In this study, we first provide a review of Bangla NLP tasks,
resources, and tools available to the research community; we benchmark datasets
collected from various platforms for nine NLP tasks using current
state-of-the-art algorithms (i.e., transformer-based models). We provide
comparative results for the studied NLP tasks by comparing monolingual vs.
multilingual models of varying sizes. We report our results using both
individual and consolidated datasets and provide data splits for future
research. We reviewed a total of 108 papers and conducted 175 sets of

structures has recently gained popularity in neural document embedding and
retrieval tasks. Although this requires the specification of bespoke
task-dependent models, encouraging empirical results are beginning to emerge.
We present the first in-depth analyses of non-linear multi-field interaction
(NL-MFI) ranking in the cooking domain in this work. Our results show that
field-weighted factorisation machines models provide a statistically
significant improvement over baselines in recipe retrieval tasks. Additionally,
we show that sparsely capturing subsets of field interactions based on domain
knowledge and feature selection heuristics offers significant advantages over
baselines and exhaustive alternatives. Although field-interaction aware models
are more elaborate from an architectural basis, they are often more
data-efficient in optimisation and are better suited for explainability due to
mirrored document and model factorisation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Shuffle Test is the most common task to evaluate whether NLP models can
measure coherence in text. Most recent work uses direct supervision on the
task; we show that by simply finetuning a RoBERTa model, we can achieve a near
perfect accuracy of 97.8%, a state-of-the-art. We argue that this outstanding
performance is unlikely to lead to a good model of text coherence, and suggest
that the Shuffle Test should be approached in a Zero-Shot setting: models
should be evaluated without being trained on the task itself. We evaluate
common models in this setting, such as Generative and Bi-directional
Transformers, and find that larger architectures achieve high-performance
out-of-the-box. Finally, we suggest the k-Block Shuffle Test, a modification of
the original by increasing the size of blocks shuffled. Even though human
reader performance remains high (around 95% accuracy), model performance drops
from 94% to 78% as block size increases, creating a conceptually simple
challenge to benchmark NLP models. Code available:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent studies have shown that providing personalized explanations alongside
recommendations increases trust and perceived quality. Furthermore, it gives
users an opportunity to refine the recommendations by critiquing parts of the
explanations. On one hand, current recommender systems model the
recommendation, explanation, and critiquing objectives jointly, but this
creates an inherent trade-off between their respective performance. On the
other hand, although recent latent linear critiquing approaches are built upon
an existing recommender system, they suffer from computational inefficiency at
inference due to the objective optimized at each conversation's turn. We
address these deficiencies with M&Ms-VAE, a novel variational autoencoder for
recommendation and explanation that is based on multimodal modeling
assumptions. We train the model under a weak supervision scheme to simulate
both fully and partially observed variables. Then, we leverage the
generalization ability of a trained M&Ms-VAE model to embed the user preference
and the critique separately. Our work's most important innovation is our
critiquing module, which is built upon and trained in a self-supervised manner
with a simple ranking objective. Experiments on four real-world datasets
demonstrate that among state-of-the-art models, our system is the first to
dominate or match the performance in terms of recommendation, explanation, and
multi-step critiquing. Moreover, M&Ms-VAE processes the critiques up to 25.6x
faster than the best baselines. Finally, we show that our model infers coherent
joint and cross generation, even under weak supervision, thanks to our
multimodal-based modeling and training scheme.]]></summary>

vision and language in recent years. However, most of them explicitly model the
cross-modal interaction between image-text pairs, by assuming that there exists
strong semantic correlation between the text and image modalities. Since this
strong assumption is often invalid in real-world scenarios, we choose to
implicitly model the cross-modal correlation for large-scale multi-modal
pre-training, which is the focus of the Chinese project `WenLan' led by our
team. Specifically, with the weak correlation assumption over image-text pairs,
we propose a two-tower pre-training model called BriVL within the cross-modal
contrastive learning framework. Unlike OpenAI CLIP that adopts a simple
contrastive learning method, we devise a more advanced algorithm by adapting
the latest method MoCo into the cross-modal scenario. By building a large
queue-based dictionary, our BriVL can incorporate more negative samples in
limited GPU resources. We further construct a large Chinese multi-source
image-text dataset called RUC-CAS-WenLan for pre-training our BriVL model.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the pre-trained BriVL model outperforms
both UNITER and OpenAI CLIP on various downstream tasks.]]></summary>

been the subject of extensive recent research. A specific form of fairness is
supplier exposure fairness where the objective is to ensure equitable coverage
of items across all suppliers in recommendations provided to users. This is
especially important in multistakeholder recommendation scenarios where it may
be important to optimize utilities not just for the end-user, but also for
other stakeholders such as item sellers or producers who desire a fair
representation of their items. This type of supplier fairness is sometimes
accomplished by attempting to increasing aggregate diversity in order to
mitigate popularity bias and to improve the coverage of long-tail items in
recommendations. In this paper, we introduce FairMatch, a general graph-based
algorithm that works as a post processing approach after recommendation
generation to improve exposure fairness for items and suppliers. The algorithm
iteratively adds high quality items that have low visibility or items from
suppliers with low exposure to the users' final recommendation lists. A
comprehensive set of experiments on two datasets and comparison with
state-of-the-art baselines show that FairMatch, while significantly improves
exposure fairness and aggregate diversity, maintains an acceptable level of
relevance of the recommendations.]]></summary>

items) to enhance the performance of recommendation systems has been widely
recognized as an important modelling dimension. While many existing approaches
focus on the \emph{integration scheme} to incorporate entity side information
-- by combining the recommendation loss function with an extra side
information-aware loss -- in this paper, we propose instead a novel
\emph{pre-training scheme} for leveraging the side information. In particular,
we first pre-train a representation model using the side information of the
entities, and then fine-tune it using an existing general representation-based
recommendation model. Specifically, we propose two pre-training models, named
\gcn{} and \com{}, by considering the entities and their relations constructed
from side information as two different types of graphs respectively, to
pre-train entity embeddings. For the \gcn{} model, two single-relational graphs
are constructed from all the users' and items' side information respectively,
to pre-train entity representations by using the Graph Convolutional Networks.
For the \com{} model, two multi-relational graphs are constructed to pre-train
the entity representations by using the Composition-based Graph Convolutional
Networks. An extensive evaluation of our pre-training models fine-tuned under
four general representation-based recommender models, i.e.\ MF, NCF, NGCF and
LightGCN, shows that effectively pre-training embeddings with both the user's
and item's side information can significantly improve these original models in
terms of both effectiveness and stability.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Session-based Recommender Systems (SRSs) have been actively developed to
recommend the next item of an anonymous short item sequence (i.e., session).
Unlike sequence-aware recommender systems where the whole interaction sequence
of each user can be used to model both the short-term interest and the general
interest of the user, the absence of user-dependent information in SRSs makes
it difficult to directly derive the user's general interest from data.
Therefore, existing SRSs have focused on how to effectively model the
information about short-term interest within the sessions, but they are
insufficient to capture the general interest of users. To this end, we propose
a novel framework to overcome the limitation of SRSs, named ProxySR, which
imitates the missing information in SRSs (i.e., general interest of users) by
modeling proxies of sessions. ProxySR selects a proxy for the input session in
an unsupervised manner, and combines it with the encoded short-term interest of
the session. As a proxy is jointly learned with the short-term interest and
selected by multiple sessions, a proxy learns to play the role of the general
interest of a user and ProxySR learns how to select a suitable proxy for an
input session. Moreover, we propose another real-world situation of SRSs where
a few users are logged-in and leave their identifiers in sessions, and a
revision of ProxySR for the situation. Our experiments on real-world datasets
show that ProxySR considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors,
and the proxies successfully imitate the general interest of the users without
any user-dependent information.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bangla -- ranked as the 6th most widely spoken language across the world
(https://www.ethnologue.com/guides/ethnologue200), with 230 million native
speakers -- is still considered as a low-resource language in the natural
language processing (NLP) community. With three decades of research, Bangla NLP
(BNLP) is still lagging behind mainly due to the scarcity of resources and the
challenges that come with it. There is sparse work in different areas of BNLP;
however, a thorough survey reporting previous work and recent advances is yet
to be done. In this study, we first provide a review of Bangla NLP tasks,
resources, and tools available to the research community; we benchmark datasets
collected from various platforms for nine NLP tasks using current
state-of-the-art algorithms (i.e., transformer-based models). We provide
comparative results for the studied NLP tasks by comparing monolingual vs.
multilingual models of varying sizes. We report our results using both
individual and consolidated datasets and provide data splits for future
research. We reviewed a total of 108 papers and conducted 175 sets of
experiments. Our results show promising performance using transformer-based
models while highlighting the trade-off with computational costs. We hope that
such a comprehensive survey will motivate the community to build on and further
advance the research on Bangla NLP.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Predicting the next interaction of a short-term interaction session is a
challenging task in session-based recommendation. Almost all existing works
rely on item transition patterns, and neglect the impact of user historical
sessions while modeling user preference, which often leads to non-personalized
recommendation. Additionally, existing personalized session-based recommenders
capture user preference only based on the sessions of the current user, but
ignore the useful item-transition patterns from other user's historical
sessions. To address these issues, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Global
Graph Neural Networks (HG-GNN) to exploit the item transitions over all
sessions in a subtle manner for better inferring user preference from the
current and historical sessions. To effectively exploit the item transitions
over all sessions from users, we propose a novel heterogeneous global graph
that contains item transitions of sessions, user-item interactions and global
co-occurrence items. Moreover, to capture user preference from sessions
comprehensively, we propose to learn two levels of user representations from
the global graph via two graph augmented preference encoders. Specifically, we
design a novel heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) on the heterogeneous
global graph to learn the long-term user preference and item representations
with rich semantics. Based on the HGNN, we propose the Current Preference
Encoder and the Historical Preference Encoder to capture the different levels
of user preference from the current and historical sessions, respectively. To
achieve personalized recommendation, we integrate the representations of the
user current preference and historical interests to generate the final user
preference representation. Extensive experimental results on three real-world
datasets show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To realize robots that can understand human instructions and perform
meaningful tasks in the near future, it is important to develop learned models
that can understand referential language to identify common objects in
real-world 3D scenes. In this paper, we develop a spatial-language model for a
3D visual grounding problem. Specifically, given a reconstructed 3D scene in
the form of a point cloud with 3D bounding boxes of potential object
candidates, and a language utterance referring to a target object in the scene,
our model identifies the target object from a set of potential candidates. Our
spatial-language model uses a transformer-based architecture that combines
spatial embedding from bounding-box with a finetuned language embedding from
DistilBert and reasons among the objects in the 3D scene to find the target
object. We show that our model performs competitively on visio-linguistic
datasets proposed by ReferIt3D. We provide additional analysis of performance
in spatial reasoning tasks decoupled from perception noise, the effect of
view-dependent utterances in terms of accuracy, and view-point annotations for
potential robotics applications.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper proposes a novel way of doing audio synthesis at the waveform
level using Transformer architectures. We propose a deep neural network for
generating waveforms, similar to wavenet. This is fully probabilistic,
auto-regressive, and causal, i.e. each sample generated depends only on the
previously observed samples. Our approach outperforms a widely used wavenet
architecture by up to 9% on a similar dataset for predicting the next step.
Using the attention mechanism, we enable the architecture to learn which audio
samples are important for the prediction of the future sample. We show how
causal transformer generative models can be used for raw waveform synthesis. We
also show that this performance can be improved by another 2% by conditioning
samples over a wider context. The flexibility of the current model to
synthesize audio from latent representations suggests a large number of
potential applications. The novel approach of using generative transformer
architectures for raw audio synthesis is, however, still far away from
generating any meaningful music, without using latent codes/meta-data to aid
the generation process.]]></summary>
