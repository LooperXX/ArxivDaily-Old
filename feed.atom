        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep Neural Networks require large amounts of labeled data for their
training. Collecting this data at scale inevitably causes label noise.Hence,the
need to develop learning algorithms that are robust to label noise. In recent
years, k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) emerged as a viable solution to this problem.
Despite its success, kNN is not without its problems. Mainly, it requires a
huge memory footprint to store all the training samples and it needs an
advanced data structure to allow for fast retrieval of the relevant examples,
given a query sample. We propose a neural network, termed kNet, that learns to
perform kNN. Once trained, we no longer need to store the training data, and
processing a query sample is a simple matter of inference. To use kNet, we
first train a preliminary network on the data set, and then train kNet on the
penultimate layer of the preliminary network.We find that kNet gives a smooth
approximation of kNN,and cannot handle the sharp label changes between samples
that kNN can exhibit. This indicates that currently kNet is best suited to
approximate kNN with a fairly large k. Experiments on two data sets show that
this is the regime in which kNN works best,and can therefore be replaced by
kNet.In practice, kNet consistently improve the results of all preliminary
networks, in all label noise regimes, by up to 3%.]]></summary>

has become an increasingly important area of research. At the same time,
network regularization has been recognized as a crucial dimension to effective
training of DNNs. However, the role of metalearning in establishing effective
regularization has not yet been fully explored. There is recent evidence that
loss-function optimization could play this role, however it is computationally
impractical as an outer loop to full training. This paper presents an algorithm
called Evolutionary Population-Based Training (EPBT) that interleaves the
training of a DNN's weights with the metalearning of loss functions. They are
parameterized using multivariate Taylor expansions that EPBT can directly
optimize. Such simultaneous adaptation of weights and loss functions can be
deceptive, and therefore EPBT uses a quality-diversity heuristic called Novelty
Pulsation as well as knowledge distillation to prevent overfitting during
training. On the CIFAR-10 and SVHN image classification benchmarks, EPBT
results in faster, more accurate learning. The discovered hyperparameters adapt
to the training process and serve to regularize the learning task by
discouraging overfitting to the labels. EPBT thus demonstrates a practical
instantiation of regularization metalearning based on simultaneous training.]]></summary>

a set of processes and tools allow humans to better comprehend the decisions
generated by black box models. However, most of the available XAI tools are
often limited to simple explanations mainly quantifying the impact of
individual features to the models' output. Therefore, human users are not able
to understand how the features are related to each other to make predictions,
whereas the inner workings of the trained models remain hidden. This paper
contributes to the development of a novel graphical explainability tool that
not only indicates the significant features of the model but also reveals the
conditional relationships between features and the inference capturing both the
direct and indirect impact of features to the models' decision. The proposed
XAI methodology, termed as gLIME, provides graphical model-agnostic
explanations either at the global (for the entire dataset) or the local scale
(for specific data points). It relies on a combination of local interpretable
model-agnostic explanations (LIME) with graphical least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (GLASSO) producing undirected Gaussian graphical models.
Regularization is adopted to shrink small partial correlation coefficients to
zero providing sparser and more interpretable graphical explanations. Two
well-known classification datasets (BIOPSY and OAI) were selected to confirm
the superiority of gLIME over LIME in terms of both robustness and consistency
over multiple permutations. Specifically, gLIME accomplished increased
stability over the two datasets with respect to features' importance (76%-96%
compared to 52%-77% using LIME). gLIME demonstrates a unique potential to
extend the functionality of the current state-of-the-art in XAI by providing
informative graphically given explanations that could unlock black boxes.]]></summary>

to the demand for data privacy and security, especially in the medical field.
However, the performance of existing FL approaches often deteriorates when
there exist domain shifts among clients, and few previous works focus on
personalization in healthcare. In this article, we propose FedHealth 2, an
extension of FedHealth \cite{chen2020fedhealth} to tackle domain shifts and get
personalized models for local clients. FedHealth 2 obtains the client
similarities via a pretrained model, and then it averages all weighted models
with preserving local batch normalization. Wearable activity recognition and

achieve better accuracy (10%+ improvement for activity recognition) and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annealed importance sampling (AIS) and related algorithms are highly
effective tools for marginal likelihood estimation, but are not fully
differentiable due to the use of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) correction steps.
Differentiability is a desirable property as it would admit the possibility of
optimizing marginal likelihood as an objective using gradient-based methods. To
this end, we propose a differentiable AIS algorithm by abandoning MH steps,
which further unlocks mini-batch computation. We provide a detailed convergence
analysis for Bayesian linear regression which goes beyond previous analyses by
explicitly accounting for non-perfect transitions. Using this analysis, we
prove that our algorithm is consistent in the full-batch setting and provide a
sublinear convergence rate. However, we show that the algorithm is inconsistent
when mini-batch gradients are used due to a fundamental incompatibility between
the goals of last-iterate convergence to the posterior and elimination of the
pathwise stochastic error. This result is in stark contrast to our experience
with stochastic optimization and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, where
the effects of gradient noise can be washed out by taking more steps of a
smaller size. Our negative result relies crucially on our explicit
consideration of convergence to the stationary distribution, and it helps
explain the difficulty of developing practically effective AIS-like algorithms
that exploit mini-batch gradients.]]></summary>

dynamical isometry and speeding up training. The increase in learning speed
that results from orthogonal initialization in linear networks has been
well-proven. However, while the same is believed to also hold for nonlinear
networks when the dynamical isometry condition is satisfied, the training
dynamics behind this contention have not been thoroughly explored. In this
work, we study the dynamics of ultra-wide networks across a range of
architectures, including Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) and Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) with orthogonal initialization via neural tangent kernel
(NTK). Through a series of propositions and lemmas, we prove that two NTKs, one
corresponding to Gaussian weights and one to orthogonal weights, are equal when
the network width is infinite. Further, during training, the NTK of an
orthogonally-initialized infinite-width network should theoretically remain
constant. This suggests that the orthogonal initialization cannot speed up
training in the NTK (lazy training) regime, contrary to the prevailing
thoughts. In order to explore under what circumstances can orthogonality
accelerate training, we conduct a thorough empirical investigation outside the
NTK regime. We find that when the hyper-parameters are set to achieve a linear
regime in nonlinear activation, orthogonal initialization can improve the
learning speed with a large learning rate or large depth.]]></summary>

degrade to pure noise if the number of importance samples is too large. To
address this pathology, we show how doubly reparameterized gradient estimators,

interpreting the diffusion matrix using normalizing flows. Specifically, we
theoretically prove that DSM (or DSD) is equivalent to the original score
matching (or Stein discrepancy) evaluated in the transformed space defined by
the normalizing flow, where the diffusion matrix is the inverse of the flow's

information for secondary uses, such as clinical events prediction or chronic
disease management. However, challenges exist for temporal data representation.
We therefore sought to identify these challenges and evaluate novel
methodologies for addressing them through a systematic examination of deep
learning solutions.

Methods: We searched five databases (PubMed, EMBASE, the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers [IEEE] Xplore Digital Library, the
Association for Computing Machinery [ACM] digital library, and Web of Science)
complemented with hand-searching in several prestigious computer science
conference proceedings. We sought articles that reported deep learning
methodologies on temporal data representation in structured EHR data from
January 1, 2010, to August 30, 2020. We summarized and analyzed the selected
articles from three perspectives: nature of time series, methodology, and model
implementation.

Results: We included 98 articles related to temporal data representation
using deep learning. Four major challenges were identified, including data
irregularity, data heterogeneity, data sparsity, and model opacity. We then
studied how deep learning techniques were applied to address these challenges.
Finally, we discuss some open challenges arising from deep learning.

Conclusion: Temporal EHR data present several major challenges for clinical
prediction modeling and data utilization. To some extent, current deep learning
solutions can address these challenges. Future studies can consider designing
comprehensive and integrated solutions. Moreover, researchers should
incorporate additional clinical domain knowledge into study designs and enhance
the interpretability of the model to facilitate its implementation in clinical
practice.]]></summary>

key enabler to the automation of data-led decision making. As an important
branch of state-of-the-art data analytics, business process predictions are
also faced with a challenge in regard to the lack of explanation to the
reasoning and decision by the underlying `black-box' prediction models. With
the development of interpretable machine learning techniques, explanations can
be generated for a black-box model, making it possible for (human) users to
access the reasoning behind machine learned predictions. In this paper, we aim
to present an approach that allows us to use model explanations to investigate
certain reasoning applied by machine learned predictions and detect potential
issues with the underlying methods thus enhancing trust in business process
prediction models. A novel contribution of our approach is the proposal of
model inspection that leverages both the explanations generated by
interpretable machine learning mechanisms and the contextual or domain
knowledge extracted from event logs that record historical process execution.
Findings drawn from this work are expected to serve as a key input to

and momentum where there is a need to draw insights from data while preserving
the data provider's privacy. However, one among other existing challenges in
the adoption of federated learning has been the lack of fair, transparent and
universally agreed incentivization schemes for rewarding the federated learning
contributors. Smart contracts on a blockchain network provide transparent,
immutable and independently verifiable proofs by all participants of the
network. We leverage this open and transparent nature of smart contracts on a
blockchain to define incentivization rules for the contributors, which is based
on a novel scalar quantity - federated contribution. Such a smart contract
based reward-driven model has the potential to revolutionize the federated
learning adoption in enterprises. Our contribution is two-fold: first is to
show how smart contract based blockchain can be a very natural communication
channel for federated learning. Second, leveraging this infrastructure, we can
show how an intuitive measure of each agents' contribution can be built and
integrated with the life cycle of the training and reward process.]]></summary>

of data and labels, and thus realize conditional generation. Among them,
auxiliary classifier generative adversarial networks (AC-GAN) have been widely
used, but suffer from the issue of low intra-class diversity on generated
samples. In this paper, we point out that the fundamental reason is that the
classifier of AC-GAN is generator-agnostic, and thus cannot provide informative
guidance to the generator to approximate the target joint distribution, leading
to a minimization of conditional entropy that decreases the intra-class
diversity. Based on this finding, we propose novel cGANs with auxiliary
discriminative classifier (ADC-GAN) to address the issue of AC-GAN.
Specifically, the auxiliary discriminative classifier becomes generator-aware
by distinguishing between the real and fake data while recognizing their
labels. We then optimize the generator based on the auxiliary classifier along
with the original discriminator to match the joint and marginal distributions
of the generated samples with those of the real samples. We provide theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence on synthetic and real-world datasets to
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ADC-GAN compared to competitive
cGANs.]]></summary>

critical domains, it remains an open question how human-AI teams can reliably
outperform AI alone and human alone in challenging prediction tasks (also known
as complementary performance). We explore two directions to understand the gaps
in achieving complementary performance. First, we argue that the typical
experimental setup limits the potential of human-AI teams. To account for lower
AI performance out-of-distribution than in-distribution because of distribution
shift, we design experiments with different distribution types and investigate
human performance for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution examples.
Second, we develop novel interfaces to support interactive explanations so that
humans can actively engage with AI assistance. Using virtual pilot studies and
large-scale randomized experiments across three tasks, we demonstrate a clear
difference between in-distribution and out-of-distribution, and observe mixed
results for interactive explanations: while interactive explanations improve
human perception of AI assistance's usefulness, they may reinforce human biases
and lead to limited performance improvement. Overall, our work points out
critical challenges and future directions towards enhancing human performance

Self-Supervised Selective Self-Training (S4T), a source-free adaptation
algorithm that first uses the model's pixel-level predictive consistency across
diverse views of each target image along with model confidence to classify
pixel predictions as either reliable or unreliable. Next, the model is
self-trained, using predicted pseudolabels for reliable predictions and
pseudolabels inferred via a selective interpolation strategy for unreliable
ones. S4T matches or improves upon the state-of-the-art in source-free
adaptation on 3 standard benchmarks for semantic segmentation within a single

Interaction among agents would bring benefits, including reducing operating
costs, high scalability, and facilitating parallel processing. These systems
are also a good option for handling large-scale, unknown, and dynamic

important challenge in various applications. These challenges include the
effect of search space size on learning time, inefficient cooperation among
agents, and the lack of proper coordination among agents' decisions. Moreover,
reinforcement learning algorithms may suffer from long convergence time in
these problems. In this paper, a communication framework using knowledge
transfer concepts is introduced to address such challenges in the herding
problem with large state space. To handle the problems of convergence,
knowledge transfer has been utilized that can significantly increase the
efficiency of reinforcement learning algorithms. Coordination between the
agents is carried out through a head agent in each group of agents and a
coordinator agent respectively. The results demonstrate that this framework

alternative to NNs (Aitchison et al. 2020). Deep kernel processes flexibly
learn good top-layer representations by alternately sampling the kernel from a
distribution over positive semi-definite matrices and performing nonlinear
transformations. A particular deep kernel process, the deep Wishart process
(DWP), is of particular interest because its prior is equivalent to deep
Gaussian process (DGP) priors. However, inference in DWPs has not yet been
possible due to the lack of sufficiently flexible distributions over positive
semi-definite matrices. Here, we give a novel approach to obtaining flexible
distributions over positive semi-definite matrices by generalising the Bartlett
decomposition of the Wishart probability density. We use this new distribution
to develop an approximate posterior for the DWP that includes dependency across
layers. We develop a doubly-stochastic inducing-point inference scheme for the
DWP and show experimentally that inference in the DWP gives improved
performance over doing inference in a DGP with the equivalent prior.]]></summary>

influential in recent years, showing good performance in several tasks as they
efficiently transform a graph into a more computationally digestible format
while preserving relevant information. However, the theoretical properties of
such algorithms, in particular the influence of hyperparameters and of the
graph structure on their convergence behaviour, have so far not been
well-understood. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis for
random-walks based embeddings techniques. Firstly, we prove that, under some
weak assumptions, vertex embeddings derived from random walks do indeed
converge both in the single limit of the number of random walks $N \to \infty$
and in the double limit of both $N$ and the length of each random walk
$L\to\infty$. Secondly, we derive concentration bounds quantifying the converge
rate of the corpora for the single and double limits. Thirdly, we use these
results to derive a heuristic for choosing the hyperparameters $N$ and $L$. We
validate and illustrate the practical importance of our findings with a range
of numerical and visual experiments on several graphs drawn from real-world

non-compliance by the participants. While much of the existing work has studied
compliance as a static behavior, we propose a game-theoretic model to study
compliance as dynamic behavior that may change over time. In rounds, a social
planner interacts with a sequence of heterogeneous agents who arrive with their
unobserved private type that determines both their prior preferences across the
actions (e.g., control and treatment) and their baseline rewards without taking
any treatment. The planner provides each agent with a randomized recommendation
that may alter their beliefs and their action selection. We develop a novel
recommendation mechanism that views the planner's recommendation as a form of
instrumental variable (IV) that only affects an agents' action selection, but
not the observed rewards. We construct such IVs by carefully mapping the
history -- the interactions between the planner and the previous agents -- to a
random recommendation. Even though the initial agents may be completely
non-compliant, our mechanism can incentivize compliance over time, thereby
enabling the estimation of the treatment effect of each treatment, and
minimizing the cumulative regret of the planner whose goal is to identify the
optimal treatment.]]></summary>

from natural examples, pose a serious threat to learning models. Defending
against adversarial attacks is a critical element for a reliable learning
system. Support vector machine (SVM) is a classical yet still important
learning algorithm even in the current deep learning era. Although a wide range
of researches have been done in recent years to improve the adversarial
robustness of learning models, but most of them are limited to deep neural
networks (DNNs) and the work for kernel SVM is still vacant. In this paper, we
aim at kernel SVM and propose adv-SVM to improve its adversarial robustness via
adversarial training, which has been demonstrated to be the most promising
defense techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
devotes to the fast and scalable adversarial training of kernel SVM.
Specifically, we first build connection of perturbations of samples between
original and kernel spaces, and then give a reduced and equivalent formulation
of adversarial training of kernel SVM based on the connection. Next, doubly
stochastic gradients (DSG) based on two unbiased stochastic approximations
(i.e., one is on training points and another is on random features) are applied
to update the solution of our objective function. Finally, we prove that our
algorithm optimized by DSG converges to the optimal solution at the rate of
O(1/t) under the constant and diminishing stepsizes. Comprehensive experimental
results show that our adversarial training algorithm enjoys robustness against
various attacks and meanwhile has the similar efficiency and scalability with
classical DSG algorithm.]]></summary>

machine learning method used for analysis is sensitive to certain features of a

threats brought by deep learning models to data security and privacy,
especially in the field of domain adaptation. Existing unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods can achieve promising performance without transferring
data from source domain to target domain. However, UDA with representation
alignment or self-supervised pseudo-labeling relies on the transferred source
models. In many data-critical scenarios, methods based on model transferring
may suffer from membership inference attacks and expose private data. In this
paper, we aim to overcome a challenging new setting where the source models are
only queryable but cannot be transferred to the target domain. We propose
Black-box Probe Domain Adaptation (BPDA), which adopts query mechanism to probe
and refine information from source model using third-party dataset. In order to
gain more informative query results, we further propose Distributionally
Adversarial Training (DAT) to align the distribution of third-party data with
that of target data. BPDA uses public third-party dataset and adversarial
examples based on DAT as the information carrier between source and target
domains, dispensing with transferring source data or model. Experimental
results on benchmarks of Digit-Five, Office-Caltech, Office-31, Office-Home,

Our method performs well on unseen data, and is faster than previous methods

that starts with an assignment of values for the variables to be optimized, and
iteratively improves it by searching a large neighborhood around the current

integer programs (MIPs). We train a Neural Diving model to represent a
probability distribution over assignments, which, together with an existing MIP
solver, generates an initial assignment. Formulating the subsequent search
steps as a Markov Decision Process, we train a Neural Neighborhood Selection
policy to select a search neighborhood at each step, which is searched using a
MIP solver to find the next assignment. The policy network is trained using
imitation learning. We propose a target policy for imitation that, given enough
compute resources, is guaranteed to select the neighborhood containing the
optimal next assignment across all possible choices for the neighborhood of a
specified size. Our approach matches or outperforms all the baselines on five
real-world MIP datasets with large-scale instances from diverse applications,

Reinforcement Learning methodologies and the problem of exploration/coverage of
unknown terrains. Within this scope, MarsExplorer, an openai-gym compatible
environment tailored to exploration/coverage of unknown areas, is presented.
MarsExplorer translates the original robotics problem into a Reinforcement
Learning setup that various off-the-shelf algorithms can tackle. Any learned
policy can be straightforwardly applied to a robotic platform without an
elaborate simulation model of the robot's dynamics to apply a different
learning/adaptation phase. One of its core features is the controllable
multi-dimensional procedural generation of terrains, which is the key for
producing policies with strong generalization capabilities. Four different
state-of-the-art RL algorithms (A3C, PPO, Rainbow, and SAC) are trained on the
MarsExplorer environment, and a proper evaluation of their results compared to
the average human-level performance is reported. In the follow-up experimental
analysis, the effect of the multi-dimensional difficulty setting on the
learning capabilities of the best-performing algorithm (PPO) is analyzed. A
milestone result is the generation of an exploration policy that follows the
Hilbert curve without providing this information to the environment or
rewarding directly or indirectly Hilbert-curve-like trajectories. The
experimental analysis is concluded by comparing PPO learned policy results with
frontier-based exploration context for extended terrain sizes. The source code

general scheme of prior methods is to optimize two-view representations of
input graphs. In many studies, a single graph-level representation is computed
as one of the contrastive objectives, capturing limited characteristics of
graphs. We argue that contrasting graphs in multiple subspaces enables graph
encoders to capture more abundant characteristics. To this end, we propose a
group contrastive learning framework in this work. Our framework embeds the
given graph into multiple subspaces, of which each representation is prompted
to encode specific characteristics of graphs. To learn diverse and informative
representations, we develop principled objectives that enable us to capture the
relations among both intra-space and inter-space representations in groups.
Under the proposed framework, we further develop an attention-based representor
function to compute representations that capture different substructures of a
given graph. Built upon our framework, we extend two current methods into
GroupCL and GroupIG, equipped with the proposed objective. Comprehensive
experimental results show our framework achieves a promising boost in

formulate the task as optimizing a binary mask distribution enabling an
accurate reconstruction. We then face two main challenges. One concerns
differentiability issues due to the binary distribution. The second one
corresponds to the elimination of redundant information by selecting variables
in a correlated fashion which requires modeling the covariance of the binary
distribution. We address both issues by introducing a relaxation of the problem
via a novel reparameterization of the logitNormal distribution. We demonstrate
that the proposed method provides an effective exploration scheme and leads to

that has low computation requirement at the edge device but has the
disadvantage of high communication overhead between edge device and server. To
reduce the communication overhead, this paper proposes a loss-based
asynchronous training scheme that updates the client-side model less frequently
and only sends/receives activations/gradients in selected epochs. To further
reduce the communication overhead, the activations/gradients are quantized
using 8-bit floating point prior to transmission. An added benefit of the
proposed communication reduction method is that the computations at the client
side are reduced due to reduction in the number of client model updates.
Furthermore, the privacy of the proposed communication reduction based split
learning method is almost the same as traditional split learning. Simulation
results on VGG11, VGG13 and ResNet18 models on CIFAR-10 show that the
communication cost is reduced by 1.64x-106.7x and the computations in the
client are reduced by 2.86x-32.1x when the accuracy degradation is less than
0.5% for the single-client case. For 5 and 10-client cases, the communication

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Traffic signal control is one of the most effective methods of traffic
management in urban areas. In recent years, traffic control methods based on
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have gained attention due to their ability to
exploit real-time traffic data, which is often poorly used by the traditional
hand-crafted methods. While most recent DRL-based methods have focused on
maximizing the throughput or minimizing the average travel time of the
vehicles, the fairness of the traffic signal controllers has often been
neglected. This is particularly important as neglecting fairness can lead to
situations where some vehicles experience extreme waiting times, or where the
throughput of a particular traffic flow is highly impacted by the fluctuations
of another conflicting flow at the intersection. In order to address these
issues, we introduce two notions of fairness: delay-based and throughput-based
fairness, which correspond to the two issues mentioned above. Furthermore, we
propose two DRL-based traffic signal control methods for implementing these
fairness notions, that can achieve a high throughput as well. We evaluate the
performance of our proposed methods using three traffic arrival distributions,
and find that our methods outperform the baselines in the tested scenarios.]]></summary>

be capable of exactly memorizing even randomly labelled data. Empirical studies

cross-entropy or squared error loss, results in significant improvement in the
ability of the network to resist such overfitting. We then provide a formal

have underlined the need for developing novel diagnosis and intervention
pipelines that can learn rapidly from small amounts of labeled data. Combined
with technological advances in next-generation sequencing, metagenome-based
diagnostic tools hold much promise to revolutionize rapid point-of-care
diagnosis. However, there are significant challenges in developing such an
approach, the chief among which is to learn self-supervised representations
that can help detect novel pathogen signatures with very low amounts of labeled
data. This is particularly a difficult task given that closely related
pathogens can share more than 90% of their genome structure. In this work, we
address these challenges by proposing MG-Net, a self-supervised representation
learning framework that leverages multi-modal context using pseudo-imaging data
derived from clinical metagenome sequences. We show that the proposed framework
can learn robust representations from unlabeled data that can be used for
downstream tasks such as metagenome sequence classification with limited access
to labeled data. Extensive experiments show that the learned features
outperform current baseline metagenome representations, given only 1000 samples
per class.]]></summary>

machine-learned predictions to overcome worst case lower bounds. This area has
revealed interesting algorithmic insights into problems, with particular
success in the design of competitive online algorithms. However, the question
of improving algorithm running times with predictions has largely been
unexplored.

We take a first step in this direction by combining the idea of
machine-learned predictions with the idea of "warm-starting" primal-dual
algorithms. We consider one of the most important primitives in combinatorial
optimization: weighted bipartite matching and its generalization to
$b$-matching. We identify three key challenges when using learned dual
variables in a primal-dual algorithm. First, predicted duals may be infeasible,
so we give an algorithm that efficiently maps predicted infeasible duals to
nearby feasible solutions. Second, once the duals are feasible, they may not be
optimal, so we show that they can be used to quickly find an optimal solution.
Finally, such predictions are useful only if they can be learned, so we show
that the problem of learning duals for matching has low sample complexity. We
validate our theoretical findings through experiments on both real and
synthetic data. As a result we give a rigorous, practical, and empirically
effective method to compute bipartite matchings.]]></summary>

which deals with convoluted and overlapping boundaries that arise due to
several labels being active for a particular data instance. We propose a
classifier capable of extracting underlying features and introducing
non-linearity to the data to handle the complex decision boundaries. A novel
neural network model has been developed where the input features are subjected
to two transformations adapted from multi-label functional link artificial
neural network and autoencoders. First, a functional expansion of the original
features are made using basis functions. This is followed by an
autoencoder-aided transformation and reduction on the expanded features. This
network is capable of improving separability for the multi-label data owing to
the two-layer transformation while reducing the expanded feature space to a
more manageable amount. This balances the input dimension which leads to a
better classification performance even for a limited amount of data. The
proposed network has been validated on five ML datasets which shows its
superior performance in comparison with six well-established ML classifiers.
Furthermore, a single-label variation of the proposed network has also been
formulated simultaneously and tested on four relevant datasets against three
existing classifiers to establish its effectiveness.]]></summary>

used for unsupervised anomaly detection. While performance keeps improving,
several limitations exist particularly attributed to difficulties at capturing
multimodal supports and to the ability to approximate the underlying
distribution closer to the tails, i.e. the boundary of the distribution's
support. This paper proposes an approach that attempts to alleviate such
shortcomings. We propose an invertible-residual-network-based model, the
Boundary of Distribution Support Generator (BDSG). GANs generally do not
guarantee the existence of a probability distribution and here, we use the
recently developed Invertible Residual Network (IResNet) and Residual Flow
(ResFlow), for density estimation. These models have not yet been used for
anomaly detection. We leverage IResNet and ResFlow for Out-of-Distribution
(OoD) sample detection and for sample generation on the boundary using a
compound loss function that forces the samples to lie on the boundary. The BDSG
addresses non-convex support, disjoint components, and multimodal
distributions. Results on synthetic data and data from multimodal
distributions, such as MNIST and CIFAR-10, demonstrate competitive performance
compared to methods from the literature.]]></summary>

critical cardiovascular syndromes such as arrhythmia and myocardial infarction
(MI). Current machine learning techniques either depend on manually extracted
features or large and complex deep learning networks which merely utilize the
1D ECG signal directly. Since intelligent multimodal fusion can perform at the
stateof-the-art level with an efficient deep network, therefore, in this paper,
we propose two computationally efficient multimodal fusion frameworks for ECG
heart beat classification called Multimodal Image Fusion (MIF) and Multimodal
Feature Fusion (MFF). At the input of these frameworks, we convert the raw ECG
data into three different images using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Recurrence
Plot (RP) and Markov Transition Field (MTF). In MIF, we first perform image
fusion by combining three imaging modalities to create a single image modality
which serves as input to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In MFF, we
extracted features from penultimate layer of CNNs and fused them to get unique
and interdependent information necessary for better performance of classifier.
These informational features are finally used to train a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) classifier for ECG heart-beat classification. We demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed fusion models by performing experiments on
PhysioNets MIT-BIH dataset for five distinct conditions of arrhythmias which
are consistent with the AAMI EC57 protocols and on PTB diagnostics dataset for
Myocardial Infarction (MI) classification. We achieved classification accuracy
of 99.7% and 99.2% on arrhythmia and MI classification, respectively.]]></summary>

communicating due to social isolation and quarantine. Also, it was the primary
source of misinformation dissemination on a large scale, referred to as the

To tackle this problem, we present two COVID-19 related misinformation datasets
on Twitter and propose a misinformation detection system comprising
network-based and content-based processes based on machine learning algorithms
and NLP techniques. In the network-based process, we focus on social
properties, network characteristics, and users. On the other hand, we classify
misinformation using the content of the tweets directly in the content-based
process, which contains text classification models (paragraph-level and
sentence-level) and similarity models. The evaluation results on the
network-based process show the best results for the artificial neural network
model with an F1 score of 88.68%. In the content-based process, our novel
similarity models, which obtained an F1 score of 90.26%, show an improvement in
the misinformation classification results compared to the network-based models.
In addition, in the text classification models, the best result was achieved
using the stacking ensemble-learning model by obtaining an F1 score of 95.18%.
Furthermore, we test our content-based models on the Constraint@AAAI2021
dataset, and by getting an F1 score of 94.38%, we improve the baseline results.
Finally, we develop a fact-checking website called Checkovid that uses each
process to detect misinformative and informative claims in the domain of
COVID-19 from different perspectives.]]></summary>

target task demonstrations. Prior approaches for demonstration-guided RL treat
every new task as an independent learning problem and attempt to follow the
provided demonstrations step-by-step, akin to a human trying to imitate a
completely unseen behavior by following the demonstrator's exact muscle
movements. Naturally, such learning will be slow, but often new behaviors are
not completely unseen: they share subtasks with behaviors we have previously
learned. In this work, we aim to exploit this shared subtask structure to
increase the efficiency of demonstration-guided RL. We first learn a set of
reusable skills from large offline datasets of prior experience collected
across many tasks. We then propose Skill-based Learning with Demonstrations
(SkiLD), an algorithm for demonstration-guided RL that efficiently leverages
the provided demonstrations by following the demonstrated skills instead of the
primitive actions, resulting in substantial performance improvements over prior
demonstration-guided RL approaches. We validate the effectiveness of our
approach on long-horizon maze navigation and complex robot manipulation tasks.]]></summary>

features from images for enabling detection of a vast amount of object types.
However, utilization of such backbones in object detection applications
developed for specific object types can unnecessarily over-process an extensive
amount of background. In addition, they are agnostic to object scales, thus
redundantly process all image regions at the same resolution. In this work we
introduce BLT-net, a new low-computation two-stage object detection
architecture designed to process images with a significant amount of background
and objects of variate scales. BLT-net reduces computations by separating
objects from background using a very lite first-stage. BLT-net then efficiently
merges obtained proposals to further decrease processed background and then
dynamically reduces their resolution to minimize computations. Resulting image
proposals are then processed in the second-stage by a highly accurate model. We
demonstrate our architecture on the pedestrian detection problem, where objects
are of different sizes, images are of high resolution and object detection is
required to run in real-time. We show that our design reduces computations by a
factor of x4-x7 on the Citypersons and Caltech datasets with respect to leading
pedestrian detectors, on account of a small accuracy degradation. This method
can be applied on other object detection applications in scenes with a
considerable amount of background and variate object sizes to reduce
computations.]]></summary>

continued access to source data during adaptation, which may be infeasible due

to a new target domain given only unlabeled target data. We propose
Self-Supervised Selective Self-Training (S4T), a source-free adaptation
algorithm that first uses the model's pixel-level predictive consistency across
diverse views of each target image along with model confidence to classify
pixel predictions as either reliable or unreliable. Next, the model is
self-trained, using predicted pseudolabels for reliable predictions and
pseudolabels inferred via a selective interpolation strategy for unreliable
ones. S4T matches or improves upon the state-of-the-art in source-free

model's prediction for an individual will change due to the inclusion or
removal of a single other person in the model's training data. Leave-one-out
unfairness appeals to the idea that fair decisions are not arbitrary: they
should not be based on the chance event of any one person's inclusion in the
training data. Leave-one-out unfairness is closely related to algorithmic
stability, but it focuses on the consistency of an individual point's
prediction outcome over unit changes to the training data, rather than the
error of the model in aggregate. Beyond formalizing leave-one-out unfairness,
we characterize the extent to which deep models behave leave-one-out unfairly
on real data, including in cases where the generalization error is small.
Further, we demonstrate that adversarial training and randomized smoothing
techniques have opposite effects on leave-one-out fairness, which sheds light
on the relationships between robustness, memorization, individual fairness, and
leave-one-out fairness in deep models. Finally, we discuss salient practical
applications that may be negatively affected by leave-one-out unfairness.]]></summary>

of main abdominal organs seems to be a solved problem as state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods have achieved comparable results with inter-rater variability on
many benchmark datasets. However, most of the existing abdominal datasets only
contain single-center, single-phase, single-vendor, or single-disease cases,
and it is unclear whether the excellent performance can generalize on diverse
datasets. This paper presents a large and diverse abdominal CT organ
segmentation dataset, termed AbdomenCT-1K, with more than 1000 (1K) CT scans
from 12 medical centers, including multi-phase, multi-vendor, and multi-disease
cases. Furthermore, we conduct a large-scale study for liver, kidney, spleen,
and pancreas segmentation and reveal the unsolved segmentation problems of the
SOTA methods, such as the limited generalization ability on distinct medical
centers, phases, and unseen diseases. To advance the unsolved problems, we
further build four organ segmentation benchmarks for fully supervised,
semi-supervised, weakly supervised, and continual learning, which are currently
challenging and active research topics. Accordingly, we develop a simple and
effective method for each benchmark, which can be used as out-of-the-box
methods and strong baselines. We believe the AbdomenCT-1K dataset will promote
future in-depth research towards clinical applicable abdominal organ
segmentation methods. The datasets, codes, and trained models are publicly

valuable guidance for graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn nodes'
representations. Existing GCN models that capture nodes' structural information
weight in- and out-neighbors equally or differentiate in- and out-neighbors
globally without considering nodes' local topologies. We observe that in- and
out-neighbors contribute differently for nodes with different local topologies.
To explore the directional structural information for different nodes, we
propose a GCN model with weighted structural features, named WGCN. WGCN first
captures nodes' structural fingerprints via a direction and degree aware Random
Walk with Restart algorithm, where the walk is guided by both edge direction
and nodes' in- and out-degrees. Then, the interactions between nodes'
structural fingerprints are used as the weighted node structural features. To
further capture nodes' high-order dependencies and graph geometry, WGCN embeds
graphs into a latent space to obtain nodes' latent neighbors and geometrical
relationships. Based on nodes' geometrical relationships in the latent space,
WGCN differentiates latent, in-, and out-neighbors with an attention-based
geometrical aggregation. Experiments on transductive node classification tasks
show that WGCN outperforms the baseline models consistently by up to 17.07% in

resizing and adding the resulting object 3D feature maps over background scene
feature maps. We show that classifiers for object categories, color, materials,

versatile backbone for visual recognition and dense predictions, unlike modern
MLP architectures, e.g., MLP-Mixer, ResMLP, and gMLP, whose architectures are
correlated to image size and thus are infeasible in object detection and
segmentation. CycleMLP has two advantages compared to modern approaches. (1) It
can cope with various image sizes. (2) It achieves linear computational
complexity to image size by using local windows. In contrast, previous MLPs
have quadratic computations because of their fully spatial connections. We
build a family of models that surpass existing MLPs and achieve a comparable
accuracy (83.2%) on ImageNet-1K classification compared to the state-of-the-art
Transformer such as Swin Transformer (83.3%) but using fewer parameters and
FLOPs. We expand the MLP-like models' applicability, making them a versatile
backbone for dense prediction tasks. CycleMLP aims to provide a competitive
baseline on object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation
for MLP models. In particular, CycleMLP achieves 45.1 mIoU on ADE20K val,

signal processing and control. For systems that are well-represented by a fully
known linear Gaussian state space (SS) model, the celebrated Kalman filter (KF)
is a low complexity optimal solution. However, both linearity of the underlying
SS model and accurate knowledge of it are often not encountered in practice.
Here, we present KalmanNet, a real-time state estimator that learns from data
to carry out Kalman filtering under non-linear dynamics with partial

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Radiation exposure in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging limits its
usage in the studies of radiation-sensitive populations, e.g., pregnant women,
children, and adults that require longitudinal imaging. Reducing the PET
radiotracer dose or acquisition time reduces photon counts, which can
deteriorate image quality. Recent deep-neural-network (DNN) based methods for
image-to-image translation enable the mapping of low-quality PET images
(acquired using substantially reduced dose), coupled with the associated
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, to high-quality PET images. However,
such DNN methods focus on applications involving test data that match the
statistical characteristics of the training data very closely and give little
attention to evaluating the performance of these DNNs on new
out-of-distribution (OOD) acquisitions. We propose a novel DNN formulation that
models the (i) underlying sinogram-based physics of the PET imaging system and
(ii) the uncertainty in the DNN output through the per-voxel heteroscedasticity
of the residuals between the predicted and the high-quality reference images.
Our sinogram-based uncertainty-aware DNN framework, namely, suDNN, estimates a
standard-dose PET image using multimodal input in the form of (i) a
low-dose/low-count PET image and (ii) the corresponding multi-contrast MRI
images, leading to improved robustness of suDNN to OOD acquisitions. Results on
in vivo simultaneous PET-MRI, and various forms of OOD data in PET-MRI, show
the benefits of suDNN over the current state of the art, quantitatively and
qualitatively.]]></summary>

accurately determined from clinical indicators. This is due in part to the
heterogeneity of damage inflicted to the brain, ultimately resulting in diverse
and complex outcomes. Using a data-driven approach on many distinct data
elements may be necessary to describe this large set of outcomes and thereby
robustly depict the nuanced differences among TBI patients' recovery. In this
work, we develop a method for modeling large heterogeneous data types relevant
to TBI. Our approach is geared toward the probabilistic representation of mixed
continuous and discrete variables with missing values. The model is trained on
a dataset encompassing a variety of data types, including demographics,
blood-based biomarkers, and imaging findings. In addition, it includes a set of
clinical outcome assessments at 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury. The model is
used to stratify patients into distinct groups in an unsupervised learning
setting. We use the model to infer outcomes using input data, and show that the
collection of input data reduces uncertainty of outcomes over a baseline
approach. In addition, we quantify the performance of a likelihood scoring
technique that can be used to self-evaluate the extrapolation risk of prognosis
on unseen patients.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The performance of deep neural networks crucially depends on good
hyperparameter configurations. Bayesian optimization is a powerful framework
for optimizing the hyperparameters of DNNs. These methods need sufficient
evaluation data to approximate and minimize the validation error function of
hyperparameters. However, the expensive evaluation cost of DNNs leads to very
few evaluation data within a limited time, which greatly reduces the efficiency
of Bayesian optimization. Besides, the previous researches focus on using the
complete evaluation data to conduct Bayesian optimization, and ignore the
intermediate evaluation data generated by early stopping methods. To alleviate
the insufficient evaluation data problem, we propose a fast hyperparameter
optimization method, HOIST, that utilizes both the complete and intermediate
evaluation data to accelerate the hyperparameter optimization of DNNs.
Specifically, we train multiple basic surrogates to gather information from the
mixed evaluation data, and then combine all basic surrogates using weighted
bagging to provide an accurate ensemble surrogate. Our empirical studies show
that HOIST outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on a wide range of DNNs,
including feed forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks,
recurrent neural networks, and variational autoencoder.]]></summary>

preserve the privacy of the users, therefore we do not allow any communication

In order to train the controllers, we use the idea of imitation learning --
we first find an optimum solution for a relaxed version of the problem using
quadratic optimization and then train the controllers to imitate this solution.
We also investigate the effects of regularization of the optimum solution on
the performance of the controllers. The method is evaluated on realistic data
and shows improved performance and training speed compared to similar

analyze the real-world evidence (RWE) of COVID-19 pharmacotherapy and validate
the results of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Machine learning (ML) methods
are being used in RWE and are promising tools for precision-medicine. In this
study, ML methods are applied to study the efficacy of therapies on COVID-19
hospital admissions in the Valencian Region in Spain. Methods: 5244 and 1312
COVID-19 hospital admissions - dated between January 2020 and January 2021 from
10 health departments, were used respectively for training and validation of
separate treatment-effect models (TE-ML) for remdesivir, corticosteroids,
tocilizumab, lopinavir-ritonavir, azithromycin and
chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. 2390 admissions from 2 additional health
departments were reserved as an independent test to analyze retrospectively the
survival benefits of therapies in the population selected by the TE-ML models
using cox-proportional hazard models. TE-ML models were adjusted using
treatment propensity scores to control for pre-treatment confounding variables
associated to outcome and further evaluated for futility. ML architecture was
based on boosted decision-trees. Results: In the populations identified by the
TE-ML models, only Remdesivir and Tocilizumab were significantly associated
with an increase in survival time, with hazard ratios of 0.41 (P = 0.04) and
0.21 (P = 0.001), respectively. No survival benefits from chloroquine
derivatives, lopinavir-ritonavir and azithromycin were demonstrated. Tools to
explain the predictions of TE-ML models are explored at patient-level as
potential tools for personalized decision making and precision medicine.
Conclusion: ML methods are suitable tools toward RWE analysis of COVID-19
pharmacotherapies. Results obtained reproduce published results on RWE and
validate the results from RCTs.]]></summary>

obstacles including: the need for labeled data, the violation of the locality
learning principle, the need for symmetric connections, and the lack of
modularity. Tourbillon is a new architecture that addresses all these
limitations. At its core, it consists of a stack of circular autoencoders
followed by an output layer. The circular autoencoders are trained in
self-supervised mode by recirculation algorithms and the top layer in
supervised mode by stochastic gradient descent, with the option of propagating
error information through the entire stack using non-symmetric connections.
While the Tourbillon architecture is meant primarily to address physical
constraints, and not to improve current engineering applications of deep
learning, we demonstrate its viability on standard benchmark datasets including
MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR10. We show that Tourbillon can achieve
comparable performance to models trained with backpropagation and outperform

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present polynomial time and sample efficient algorithms for learning an
unknown depth-2 feedforward neural network with general ReLU activations, under
mild non-degeneracy assumptions. In particular, we consider learning an unknown
network of the form $f(x) = {a}^{\mathsf{T}}\sigma({W}^\mathsf{T}x+b)$, where
$x$ is drawn from the Gaussian distribution, and $\sigma(t) := \max(t,0)$ is
the ReLU activation. Prior works for learning networks with ReLU activations
assume that the bias $b$ is zero. In order to deal with the presence of the
bias terms, our proposed algorithm consists of robustly decomposing multiple
higher order tensors arising from the Hermite expansion of the function $f(x)$.
Using these ideas we also establish identifiability of the network parameters
under minimal assumptions.]]></summary>

success of software projects. To support such activities and keep code
up-to-date and error-free, software communities make use of issue trackers,
i.e., tools for signaling, handling, and addressing the issues occurring in
software systems. However, in popular projects, tens or hundreds of issue
reports are daily submitted. In this context, identifying the type of each
submitted report (e.g., bug report, feature request, etc.) would facilitate the
management and the prioritization of the issues to address. To support issue
handling activities, in this paper, we propose Ticket Tagger, a GitHub app
analyzing the issue title and description through machine learning techniques
to automatically recognize the types of reports submitted on GitHub and assign
labels to each issue accordingly. We empirically evaluated the tool's
prediction performance on about 30,000 GitHub issues. Our results show that the
Ticket Tagger can identify the correct labels to assign to GitHub issues with
reasonably high effectiveness. Considering these results and the fact that the
tool is designed to be easily integrated in the GitHub issue management
process, Ticket Tagger consists in a useful solution for developers.]]></summary>

trajectories and use support vector machines to determine the boundaries
between initial conditions corresponding to different classes of trajectories.
We then show that these boundaries between different classes of trajectories
approximate invariant phase space structures of the same type observed in
earlier analyses of Chesnavich's model. Our approach is designed with

three-dimensional (3D) medical images has great potential that can be extended
to many medical applications, such as, image enhancement and disease
progression modeling. However, current GAN technologies for 3D medical image
synthesis need to be significantly improved to be readily adapted to real-world
medical problems. In this paper, we extend the state-of-the-art StyleGAN2
model, which natively works with two-dimensional images, to enable 3D image
synthesis. In addition to the image synthesis, we investigate the
controllability and interpretability of the 3D-StyleGAN via style vectors
inherited form the original StyleGAN2 that are highly suitable for medical
applications: (i) the latent space projection and reconstruction of unseen real
images, and (ii) style mixing. We demonstrate the 3D-StyleGAN's performance and
feasibility with ~12,000 three-dimensional full brain MR T1 images, although it
can be applied to any 3D volumetric images. Furthermore, we explore different
configurations of hyperparameters to investigate potential improvement of the
image synthesis with larger networks. The codes and pre-trained networks are

spectrum of important applications, from image recognition to autonomous
vehicles. Unfortunately, DNNs are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks
that affect virtually all state-of-the-art models. These attacks make small
imperceptible modifications to inputs that are sufficient to induce the DNNs to
produce the wrong classification.

In this paper we propose a novel, lightweight adversarial correction and/or
detection mechanism for image classifiers that relies on undervolting (running
a chip at a voltage that is slightly below its safe margin). We propose using
controlled undervolting of the chip running the inference process in order to
introduce a limited number of compute errors. We show that these errors disrupt
the adversarial input in a way that can be used either to correct the
classification or detect the input as adversarial. We evaluate the proposed
solution in an FPGA design and through software simulation. We evaluate 10
attacks on two popular DNNs and show an average detection rate of 80% to 95%.]]></summary>

solving new tasks, which suggests the need for learning algorithms that can
modify the mechanisms for choosing certain actions independently of those for

achieve this kind of modular credit assignment. To answer this question, we
define modular credit assignment as a constraint on minimizing the algorithmic
mutual information among feedback signals for different decisions. We introduce
what we call the modularity criterion for testing whether a learning algorithm
satisfies this constraint by performing causal analysis on the algorithm
itself. We generalize the recently proposed societal decision-making framework
as a more granular formalism than the Markov decision process to prove that for
decision sequences that do not contain cycles, certain single-step temporal
difference action-value methods meet this criterion while all policy-gradient

optimization over a rolling time horizon with a model predictive control (MPC)
component that relocates idle vehicles to anticipate the demand. The MPC
optimization operates over a longer time horizon to compensate for the inherent
myopic nature of the real-time dispatching. These longer time horizons are
beneficial for the quality of relocation decisions but increase computational
complexity. Consequently, the ride-sharing operators are often forced to use a
relatively short time horizon. To address this computational challenge, this
paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines machine learning and
optimization. The machine-learning component learns the optimal solution to the
MPC on the aggregated level to overcome the sparsity and high-dimensionality of
the solution. The optimization component transforms the machine-learning
prediction back to the original granularity through a tractable transportation
model. As a consequence, the original NP-hard MPC problem is reduced to a
polynomial time prediction and optimization, which allows the ride-sharing
operators to consider a longer time horizon. Experimental results show that the
hybrid approach achieves significantly better service quality than the MPC
optimization in terms of average rider waiting time, due to its ability to
model a longer horizon.]]></summary>

hands and information devices owing to its ability to reflect human motion
intentions. Although various EMG classification methods have been introduced
into EMG-based control systems, they do not fully consider the stochastic
characteristics of EMG signals. This paper proposes an EMG pattern
classification method incorporating a scale mixture-based generative model. A
scale mixture model is a stochastic EMG model in which the EMG variance is
considered as a random variable, enabling the representation of uncertainty in
the variance. This model is extended in this study and utilized for EMG pattern
classification. The proposed method is trained by variational Bayesian
learning, thereby allowing the automatic determination of the model complexity.
Furthermore, to optimize the hyperparameters of the proposed method with a
partial discriminative approach, a mutual information-based determination
method is introduced. Simulation and EMG analysis experiments demonstrated the
relationship between the hyperparameters and classification accuracy of the
proposed method as well as the validity of the proposed method. The comparison
using public EMG datasets revealed that the proposed method outperformed the
various conventional classifiers. These results indicated the validity of the
proposed method and its applicability to EMG-based control systems. In EMG
pattern recognition, a classifier based on a generative model that reflects the
stochastic characteristics of EMG signals can outperform the conventional
general-purpose classifier.]]></summary>

how users interact with multimodal items is a continuing concern within the
rapid development of recommender systems. The majority of previous work focuses
on modeling user-item interactions with multimodal features included as side
information. However, this scheme is not well-designed for multimedia
recommendation. Specifically, only collaborative item-item relationships are
implicitly modeled through high-order item-user-item relations. Considering
that items are associated with rich contents in multiple modalities, we argue
that the latent semantic item-item structures underlying these multimodal
contents could be beneficial for learning better item representations and
further boosting recommendation. To this end, we propose a LATent sTructure
mining method for multImodal reCommEndation, which we term LATTICE for brevity.
To be specific, in the proposed LATTICE model, we devise a novel modality-aware
structure learning layer, which learns item-item structures for each modality
and aggregates multiple modalities to obtain latent item graphs. Based on the
learned latent graphs, we perform graph convolutions to explicitly inject
high-order item affinities into item representations. These enriched item
representations can then be plugged into existing collaborative filtering
methods to make more accurate recommendations. Extensive experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art multimedia recommendation methods and validate the efficacy of
mining latent item-item relationships from multimodal features.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this work we introduce a manifold learning-based method for uncertainty
quantification (UQ) in systems describing complex spatiotemporal processes. Our
first objective is to identify the embedding of a set of high-dimensional data
representing quantities of interest of the computational or analytical model.
For this purpose, we employ Grassmannian diffusion maps, a two-step nonlinear
dimension reduction technique which allows us to reduce the dimensionality of
the data and identify meaningful geometric descriptions in a parsimonious and
inexpensive manner. Polynomial chaos expansion is then used to construct a
mapping between the stochastic input parameters and the diffusion coordinates
of the reduced space. An adaptive clustering technique is proposed to identify
an optimal number of clusters of points in the latent space. The similarity of
points allows us to construct a number of geometric harmonic emulators which
are finally utilized as a set of inexpensive pre-trained models to perform an
inverse map of realizations of latent features to the ambient space and thus
perform accurate out-of-sample predictions. Thus, the proposed method acts as
an encoder-decoder system which is able to automatically handle very
high-dimensional data while simultaneously operating successfully in the
small-data regime. The method is demonstrated on two benchmark problems and on
a system of advection-diffusion-reaction equations which model a first-order
chemical reaction between two species. In all test cases, the proposed method
is able to achieve highly accurate approximations which ultimately lead to the
significant acceleration of UQ tasks.]]></summary>

tools. This study demonstrates that we can effectively and automatically learn
a good heuristic via reinforcement learning for an invariant synthesizer PCSat.
Our experiment shows that PCSat combined with the heuristic learned by

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bayesian Networks have been widely used in the last decades in many fields,
to describe statistical dependencies among random variables. In general,
learning the structure of such models is a problem with considerable
theoretical interest that poses many challenges. On the one hand, it is a
well-known NP-complete problem, practically hardened by the huge search space
of possible solutions. On the other hand, the phenomenon of I-equivalence,
i.e., different graphical structures underpinning the same set of statistical
dependencies, may lead to multimodal fitness landscapes further hindering
maximum likelihood approaches to solve the task. In particular, we exploit the
NSGA-II multi-objective optimization procedure in order to explicitly account
for both the likelihood of a solution and the number of selected arcs, by
setting these as the two objective functions of the method. The aim of this
work is to investigate the behavior of NSGA-II and analyse the quality of its
solutions. We thus thoroughly examined the optimization results obtained on a
wide set of simulated data, by considering both the goodness of the inferred
solutions in terms of the objective functions values achieved, and by comparing
the retrieved structures with the ground truth, i.e., the networks used to
generate the target data. Our results show that NSGA-II can converge to
solutions characterized by better likelihood and less arcs than classic
approaches, although paradoxically characterized in many cases by a lower
similarity with the target network.]]></summary>

presence of large-scale labeled datasets. However, it is prohibitively
time-costly and labor-expensive to collect sufficient labeled data in most
realistic scenarios. To mitigate the requirement for labeled data,
semi-supervised learning (SSL) focuses on simultaneously exploring both labeled
and unlabeled data, while transfer learning (TL) popularizes a favorable
practice of fine-tuning a pre-trained model to the target data. A dilemma is
thus encountered: Without a decent pre-trained model to provide an implicit
regularization, SSL through self-training from scratch will be easily misled by
inaccurate pseudo-labels, especially in large-sized label space; Without
exploring the intrinsic structure of unlabeled data, TL through fine-tuning
from limited labeled data is at risk of under-transfer caused by model shift.
To escape from this dilemma, we present Self-Tuning to enable data-efficient

with rare alphabets, is a challenging problem. The main difficulty comes from
the very few annotated data and the limited linguistic information (e.g.
dictionaries and language models). Thus, we propose a few-shot learning-based
handwriting recognition approach that significantly reduces the human labor
annotation process, requiring only few images of each alphabet symbol. First,
our model detects all symbols of a given alphabet in a textline image, then a
decoding step maps the symbol similarity scores to the final sequence of
transcribed symbols. Our model is first pretrained on synthetic line images
generated from any alphabet, even though different from the target domain. A
second training step is then applied to diminish the gap between the source and
target data. Since this retraining would require annotation of thousands of
handwritten symbols together with their bounding boxes, we propose to avoid
such human effort through an unsupervised progressive learning approach that
automatically assigns pseudo-labels to the non-annotated data. The evaluation
on different manuscript datasets show that our model can lead to competitive
results with a significant reduction in human effort.]]></summary>

but its acquisition speed is quite slow due to the physiological limitations.
Recently, super-resolution methods have shown excellent performance in
accelerating MRI. In some circumstances, it is difficult to obtain
high-resolution images even with prolonged scan time. Therefore, we proposed a
novel super-resolution method that uses a generative adversarial network (GAN)
with cyclic loss and attention mechanism to generate high-resolution MR images
from low-resolution MR images by a factor of 2. We implemented our model on
pelvic images from healthy subjects as training and validation data, while
those data from patients were used for testing. The MR dataset was obtained
using different imaging sequences, including T2, T2W SPAIR, and mDIXON-W. Four
methods, i.e., BICUBIC, SRCNN, SRGAN, and EDSR were used for comparison.
Structural similarity, peak signal to noise ratio, root mean square error, and
variance inflation factor were used as calculation indicators to evaluate the
performances of the proposed method. Various experimental results showed that
our method can better restore the details of the high-resolution MR image as
compared to the other methods. In addition, the reconstructed high-resolution
MR image can provide better lesion textures in the tumor patients, which is
promising to be used in clinical diagnosis.]]></summary>

recent years owing to their capability to model and learn from graph-structured
data. Such an ability has strong implications in a wide variety of fields whose
data is inherently relational, for which conventional neural networks do not
perform well. Indeed, as recent reviews can attest, research in the area of
GNNs has grown rapidly and has lead to the development of a variety of GNN
algorithm variants as well as to the exploration of groundbreaking applications
in chemistry, neurology, electronics, or communication networks, among others.
At the current stage of research, however, the efficient processing of GNNs is
still an open challenge for several reasons. Besides of their novelty, GNNs are
hard to compute due to their dependence on the input graph, their combination
of dense and very sparse operations, or the need to scale to huge graphs in
some applications. In this context, this paper aims to make two main
contributions. On the one hand, a review of the field of GNNs is presented from
the perspective of computing. This includes a brief tutorial on the GNN
fundamentals, an overview of the evolution of the field in the last decade, and
a summary of operations carried out in the multiple phases of different GNN
algorithm variants. On the other hand, an in-depth analysis of current software
and hardware acceleration schemes is provided, from which a hardware-software,
graph-aware, and communication-centric vision for GNN accelerators is
distilled.]]></summary>

single-step policies or single-step models, leveraging the Markov property to
factorize the problem in time. However, we can also view RL as a sequence
modeling problem, with the goal being to predict a sequence of actions that
leads to a sequence of high rewards. Viewed in this way, it is tempting to
consider whether powerful, high-capacity sequence prediction models that work
well in other domains, such as natural-language processing, can also provide
simple and effective solutions to the RL problem. To this end, we explore how
RL can be reframed as "one big sequence modeling" problem, using
state-of-the-art Transformer architectures to model distributions over
sequences of states, actions, and rewards. Addressing RL as a sequence modeling
problem significantly simplifies a range of design decisions: we no longer
require separate behavior policy constraints, as is common in prior work on
offline model-free RL, and we no longer require ensembles or other epistemic
uncertainty estimators, as is common in prior work on model-based RL. All of
these roles are filled by the same Transformer sequence model. In our
experiments, we demonstrate the flexibility of this approach across
long-horizon dynamics prediction, imitation learning, goal-conditioned RL, and
offline RL.]]></summary>

promising successes in goodness-of-fit tests and model learning in high
dimensions. Despite their theoretical elegance, their empirical performance
depends crucially on the search of optimal slicing directions to discriminate
between two distributions. Unfortunately, previous gradient-based optimisation
approaches for this task return sub-optimal results: they are computationally
expensive, sensitive to initialization, and they lack theoretical guarantees
for convergence. We address these issues in two steps. First, we provide
theoretical results stating that the requirement of using optimal slicing
directions in the kernelized version of SSD can be relaxed, validating the
resulting discrepancy with finite random slicing directions. Second, given that
good slicing directions are crucial for practical performance, we propose a
fast algorithm for finding such slicing directions based on ideas of active
sub-space construction and spectral decomposition. Experiments on
goodness-of-fit tests and model learning show that our approach achieves both
improved performance and faster convergence. Especially, we demonstrate a
14-80x speed-up in goodness-of-fit tests when comparing with gradient-based

meta-RL) problem setting and proposes an algorithm that performs well in this
setting. Offline meta-RL is analogous to the widely successful supervised
learning strategy of pre-training a model on a large batch of fixed,
pre-collected data (possibly from various tasks) and fine-tuning the model to a
new task with relatively little data. That is, in offline meta-RL, we
meta-train on fixed, pre-collected data from several tasks in order to adapt to
a new task with a very small amount (less than 5 trajectories) of data from the
new task. By nature of being offline, algorithms for offline meta-RL can
utilize the largest possible pool of training data available and eliminate
potentially unsafe or costly data collection during meta-training. This setting
inherits the challenges of offline RL, but it differs significantly because
offline RL does not generally consider a) transfer to new tasks or b) limited
data from the test task, both of which we face in offline meta-RL. Targeting
the offline meta-RL setting, we propose Meta-Actor Critic with Advantage
Weighting (MACAW), an optimization-based meta-learning algorithm that uses
simple, supervised regression objectives for both the inner and outer loop of
meta-training. On offline variants of common meta-RL benchmarks, we empirically
find that this approach enables fully offline meta-reinforcement learning and
achieves notable gains over prior methods.]]></summary>

the sphere, which arises in various machine learning applications such as
orthogonal dictionary learning (ODL) and robust subspace recovery (RSR). The
problem is numerically challenging due to its nonsmooth objective and nonconvex
constraint, and its algorithmic aspects have not been well explored. In this
paper, we show how the manifold structure of the sphere can be exploited to
design fast algorithms for tackling this problem. Specifically, our
contribution is threefold. First, we present a manifold proximal point
algorithm (ManPPA) for the problem and show that it converges at a sublinear
rate. Furthermore, we show that ManPPA can achieve a quadratic convergence rate
when applied to the ODL and RSR problems. Second, we propose a stochastic
variant of ManPPA called StManPPA, which is well suited for large-scale
computation, and establish its sublinear convergence rate. Both ManPPA and
StManPPA have provably faster convergence rates than existing subgradient-type
methods. Third, using ManPPA as a building block, we propose a new approach to
solving a matrix analog of the problem, in which the sphere is replaced by the
Stiefel manifold. The results from our extensive numerical experiments on the
ODL and RSR problems demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our proposed
methods.]]></summary>

society since a growing number of users use them for information seeking and
decision making. Therefore, it is crucial to address the potential unfairness
problems in recommendations. Just like users have personalized preferences on
items, users' demands for fairness are also personalized in many scenarios.
Therefore, it is important to provide personalized fair recommendations for
users to satisfy their personalized fairness demands. Besides, previous works
on fair recommendation mainly focus on association-based fairness. However, it
is important to advance from associative fairness notions to causal fairness
notions for assessing fairness more properly in recommender systems. Based on
the above considerations, this paper focuses on achieving personalized
counterfactual fairness for users in recommender systems. To this end, we
introduce a framework for achieving counterfactually fair recommendations
through adversary learning by generating feature-independent user embeddings
for recommendation. The framework allows recommender systems to achieve
personalized fairness for users while also covering non-personalized
situations. Experiments on two real-world datasets with shallow and deep
recommendation algorithms show that our method can generate fairer
recommendations for users with a desirable recommendation performance.]]></summary>

result, the trained models typically perform well for the majority of the data
but the performance may deteriorate in less dense regions of the dataset. This
issue also arises in generative modeling. A generative model may overlook
underrepresented modes that are less frequent in the empirical data
distribution. This problem is known as complete mode coverage. We propose a
sampling procedure based on ridge leverage scores which significantly improves
mode coverage when compared to standard methods and can easily be combined with
any GAN. Ridge leverage scores are computed by using an explicit feature map,
associated with the next-to-last layer of a GAN discriminator or of a

method first constructs a piecewise planar scaffolding of the scene, and then
uses it to infer dense depth using the image along with the sparse points. We

photometric consistency across time, forward-backward pose consistency, and
geometric compatibility with the sparse point cloud. We also launch the first
visual-inertial + depth dataset, which we hope will foster additional
exploration into combining the complementary strengths of visual and inertial

entities. These entities have properties -- both visible and latent -- that
determine the manner in which they interact with one another. To partition
images into entities, deep-learning researchers have proposed structural
inductive biases such as slot-based architectures. To model interactions among
entities, equivariant graph neural nets (GNNs) are used, but these are not
particularly well suited to the task for two reasons. First, GNNs do not
predispose interactions to be sparse, as relationships among independent
entities are likely to be. Second, GNNs do not factorize knowledge about
interactions in an entity-conditional manner. As an alternative, we take
inspiration from cognitive science and resurrect a classic approach, production
systems, which consist of a set of rule templates that are applied by binding
placeholder variables in the rules to specific entities. Rules are scored on
their match to entities, and the best fitting rules are applied to update
entity properties. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that this
architecture achieves a flexible, dynamic flow of control and serves to
factorize entity-specific and rule-based information. This disentangling of
knowledge achieves robust future-state prediction in rich visual environments,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods using GNNs, and allows for the
extrapolation from simple (few object) environments to more complex
environments.]]></summary>

that the area under the curve of the margin distribution on the training set is

model architecture. Compared to other deep models, DRMMs allow more flexible
conditional sampling: The model can be trained once with all variables, and
then used for sampling with arbitrary combinations of conditioning variables,
Gaussian priors, and (in)equality constraints. This provides new opportunities
for interactive and exploratory machine learning, where one should minimize the
user waiting for retraining a model. We demonstrate DRMMs in constrained

environment featuring interactions between different types of vehicles (speed
and dimension), under varying visibility and traffic conditions. Airport ground
movements are deemed safety-critical activities, and safe-separation procedures
must be maintained by Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs). Large airports with
complicated runway-taxiway systems use advanced ground surveillance systems.
However, these systems have inherent limitations and a lack of real-time
analytics. In this paper, we propose a novel computer-vision based framework,
namely "Deep4Air", which can not only augment the ground surveillance systems
via the automated visual monitoring of runways and taxiways for aircraft
location, but also provide real-time speed and distance analytics for aircraft
on runways and taxiways. The proposed framework includes an adaptive deep
neural network for efficiently detecting and tracking aircraft. The
experimental results show an average precision of detection and tracking of up
to 99.8% on simulated data with validations on surveillance videos from the
digital tower at George Bush Intercontinental Airport. The results also
demonstrate that "Deep4Air" can locate aircraft positions relative to the
airport runway and taxiway infrastructure with high accuracy. Furthermore,
aircraft speed and separation distance are monitored in real-time, providing
enhanced safety management.]]></summary>

inconspicuous texture changes of liver tumor, contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CT) imaging is effective for the diagnosis of liver cancer. In this
paper, we focus on improving automated liver tumor segmentation by integrating
multi-modal CT images. To this end, we propose a novel mutual learning (ML)
strategy for effective and robust multi-modal liver tumor segmentation.
Different from existing multi-modal methods that fuse information from
different modalities by a single model, with ML, an ensemble of
modality-specific models learn collaboratively and teach each other to distill
both the characteristics and the commonality between high-level representations
of different modalities. The proposed ML not only enables the superiority for
multi-modal learning but can also handle missing modalities by transferring
knowledge from existing modalities to missing ones. Additionally, we present a
modality-aware (MA) module, where the modality-specific models are
interconnected and calibrated with attention weights for adaptive information
exchange. The proposed modality-aware mutual learning (MAML) method achieves
promising results for liver tumor segmentation on a large-scale clinical
dataset. Moreover, we show the efficacy and robustness of MAML for handling
missing modalities on both the liver tumor and public brain tumor (BRATS 2018)

relationships as edges is the basis for a deep understanding of image content.
Despite recent advances, such as message passing and joint classification, the
detection of visual relationships remains a challenging task due to sub-optimal
exploration of the mutual interaction among the visual objects. In this work,
we propose a novel transformer formulation for scene graph generation and
relation prediction. We leverage the encoder-decoder architecture of the
transformer for rich feature embedding of nodes and edges. Specifically, we
model the node-to-node interaction with the self-attention of the transformer
encoder and the edge-to-node interaction with the cross-attention of the
transformer decoder. Further, we introduce a novel positional embedding
suitable to handle edges in the decoder. Finally, our relation prediction
module classifies the directed relation from the learned node and edge
embedding. We name this architecture as Relation Transformer Network (RTN). On
the Visual Genome and GQA dataset, we have achieved an overall mean of 4.85%
and 3.1% point improvement in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. Our
experiments show that Relation Transformer can efficiently model context across
various datasets with small, medium, and large-scale relation classification.]]></summary>

provide complementary information and microstructure details to improve the
operational performance and accuracy in brain surgery. However, compared to the
substantial image data, it is almost impossible to obtain the intraoperative 3D
shape information by using physical methods such as sensor scanning, especially
in minimally invasive surgery and robot-guided surgery. In this paper, a
general generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture based on graph
convolutional networks is proposed to reconstruct the 3D point clouds (PCs) of
brains by using one single 2D image, thus relieving the limitation of acquiring
3D shape data during surgery. Specifically, a tree-structured generative
mechanism is constructed to use the latent vector effectively and transfer
features between hidden layers accurately. With the proposed generative model,
a spontaneous image-to-PC conversion is finished in real-time. Competitive
qualitative and quantitative experimental results have been achieved on our
model. In multiple evaluation methods, the proposed model outperforms another
common point cloud generative model PointOutNet.]]></summary>

using point clouds from lidar or structured light sensors, we have few hundreds

method first constructs a piecewise planar scaffolding of the scene, and then
uses it to infer dense depth using the image along with the sparse points. We

photometric consistency across time, forward-backward pose consistency, and
geometric compatibility with the sparse point cloud. We also launch the first
visual-inertial + depth dataset, which we hope will foster additional
exploration into combining the complementary strengths of visual and inertial

description of an audio clip. Most captioning models follow an encoder-decoder

be limited in modelling temporal relationships among the time frames in an
audio signal, while RNNs can be limited in modelling the long-range

method has a better ability to model the global information within an audio

across different observations are not independent conditioned on their feature
vectors, but dependent, capturing settings where e.g. these observations are
collected on a spatial domain, a temporal domain, or a social network, which
induce dependencies. We model these dependencies in the language of Markov
Random Fields and, importantly, allow these dependencies to be substantial, i.e
do not assume that the Markov Random Field capturing these dependencies is in
high temperature. As our main contribution we provide algorithms and
statistically efficient estimation rates for this model, giving several
instantiations of our bounds in logistic regression, sparse logistic
regression, and neural network settings with dependent data. Our estimation
guarantees follow from novel results for estimating the parameters (i.e.
external fields and interaction strengths) of Ising models from a {\em single}
sample. {We evaluate our estimation approach on real networked data, showing
that it outperforms standard regression approaches that ignore dependencies,
across three text classification datasets: Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed.}]]></summary>

from incomplete and noisy perception. In this work, we draw insight that 3D
reconstruction and grasp learning are two intimately connected tasks, both of
which require a fine-grained understanding of local geometry details. We thus
propose to utilize the synergies between grasp affordance and 3D reconstruction
through multi-task learning of a shared representation. Our model takes
advantage of deep implicit functions, a continuous and memory-efficient
representation, to enable differentiable training of both tasks. We train the
model on self-supervised grasp trials data in simulation. Evaluation is
conducted on a clutter removal task, where the robot clears cluttered objects
by grasping them one at a time. The experimental results in simulation and on
the real robot have demonstrated that the use of implicit neural
representations and joint learning of grasp affordance and 3D reconstruction
have led to state-of-the-art grasping results. Our method outperforms baselines
by over 10% in terms of grasp success rate. Additional results and videos can

senior care and surgery. Existing fabric manipulation techniques, however, are
designed for specific tasks, making it difficult to generalize across different
but related tasks. We build upon the Visual Foresight framework to learn fabric
dynamics that can be efficiently reused to accomplish different sequential
fabric manipulation tasks with a single goal-conditioned policy. We extend our
earlier work on VisuoSpatial Foresight (VSF), which learns visual dynamics on
domain randomized RGB images and depth maps simultaneously and completely in
simulation. In this earlier work, we evaluated VSF on multi-step fabric
smoothing and folding tasks against 5 baseline methods in simulation and on the
da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) surgical robot without any demonstrations at train
or test time. A key finding was that depth sensing significantly improves
performance: RGBD data yields an 80% improvement in fabric folding success rate
in simulation over pure RGB data. In this work, we vary 4 components of VSF,
including data generation, visual dynamics model, cost function, and
optimization procedure. Results suggest that training visual dynamics models
using longer, corner-based actions can improve the efficiency of fabric folding
by 76% and enable a physical sequential fabric folding task that VSF could not
previously perform with 90% reliability. Code, data, videos, and supplementary

volleyball). The individuals distinct relations are then merged through an

recently. The task is challenging as it requires abstract problem understanding
and symbolic reasoning with axiomatic knowledge. However, current datasets are

Interpretable Geometry Problem Solver (Inter-GPS). Inter-GPS first parses the

parsing and neural object detecting, respectively. Unlike implicit learning in
existing methods, Inter-GPS incorporates theorem knowledge as conditional rules
and performs symbolic reasoning step by step. Also, a theorem predictor is
designed to infer the theorem application sequence fed to the symbolic solver
for the more efficient and reasonable searching path. Extensive experiments on
the Geometry3K and GEOS datasets demonstrate that Inter-GPS achieves
significant improvements over existing methods. The project with code and data

source model degrades when bumping into the high data density near decision
boundary in target domain. A common solution is to minimize the Shannon Entropy
to push the decision boundary away from the high density area. However, entropy
minimization also leads to severe reduction of prediction diversity, and
unfortunately brings harm to the domain adaptation. In this paper, we
investigate the prediction discriminability and diversity by studying the
structure of the classification output matrix of a randomly selected data
batch. We find by theoretical analysis that the prediction discriminability and
diversity could be separately measured by the Frobenius-norm and rank of the
batch output matrix. The nuclear-norm is an upperbound of the former, and a
convex approximation of the latter. Accordingly, we propose Batch Nuclear-norm
Maximization and Minimization, which performs nuclear-norm maximization on the
target output matrix to enhance the target prediction ability, and nuclear-norm
minimization on the source batch output matrix to increase applicability of the
source domain knowledge. We further approximate the nuclear-norm by
L_{1,2}-norm, and design multi-batch optimization for stable solution on large
number of categories. The fast approximation method achieves O(n^2)
computational complexity and better convergence property. Experiments show that
our method could boost the adaptation accuracy and robustness under three
typical domain adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

the sphere, which arises in various machine learning applications such as
orthogonal dictionary learning (ODL) and robust subspace recovery (RSR). The
problem is numerically challenging due to its nonsmooth objective and nonconvex
constraint, and its algorithmic aspects have not been well explored. In this
paper, we show how the manifold structure of the sphere can be exploited to
design fast algorithms for tackling this problem. Specifically, our
contribution is threefold. First, we present a manifold proximal point
algorithm (ManPPA) for the problem and show that it converges at a sublinear
rate. Furthermore, we show that ManPPA can achieve a quadratic convergence rate
when applied to the ODL and RSR problems. Second, we propose a stochastic
variant of ManPPA called StManPPA, which is well suited for large-scale
computation, and establish its sublinear convergence rate. Both ManPPA and
StManPPA have provably faster convergence rates than existing subgradient-type
methods. Third, using ManPPA as a building block, we propose a new approach to
solving a matrix analog of the problem, in which the sphere is replaced by the
Stiefel manifold. The results from our extensive numerical experiments on the
ODL and RSR problems demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our proposed

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Automated image processing approaches are indispensable for many biomedical
experiments and help to cope with the increasing amount of microscopy image
data in a fast and reproducible way. Especially state-of-the-art deep
learning-based approaches most often require large amounts of annotated
training data to produce accurate and generalist outputs, but they are often
compromised by the general lack of those annotated data sets. In this work, we
propose how conditional generative adversarial networks can be utilized to
generate realistic image data for 3D fluorescence microscopy from annotation
masks of 3D cellular structures. In combination with mask simulation
approaches, we demonstrate the generation of fully-annotated 3D microscopy data
sets that we make publicly available for training or benchmarking. An
additional positional conditioning of the cellular structures enables the
reconstruction of position-dependent intensity characteristics and allows to
generate image data of different quality levels. A patch-wise working principle
and a subsequent full-size reassemble strategy is used to generate image data
of arbitrary size and different organisms. We present this as a
proof-of-concept for the automated generation of fully-annotated training data
sets requiring only a minimum of manual interaction to alleviate the need of
manual annotations.]]></summary>

occurrence of a future accident from dashcam videos, which is vital for a
safety-guaranteed self-driving system. To encourage an early and accurate
decision, existing approaches typically focus on capturing the cues of spatial
and temporal context before a future accident occurs. However, their
decision-making lacks visual explanation and ignores the dynamic interaction
with the environment. In this paper, we propose Deep ReInforced accident
anticipation with Visual Explanation, named DRIVE. The method simulates both
the bottom-up and top-down visual attention mechanism in a dashcam observation
environment so that the decision from the proposed stochastic multi-task agent
can be visually explained by attentive regions. Moreover, the proposed dense
anticipation reward and sparse fixation reward are effective in training the
DRIVE model with our improved reinforcement learning algorithm. Experimental
results show that the DRIVE model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
multiple real-world traffic accident datasets. The code and pre-trained model

how users interact with multimodal items is a continuing concern within the
rapid development of recommender systems. The majority of previous work focuses
on modeling user-item interactions with multimodal features included as side
information. However, this scheme is not well-designed for multimedia
recommendation. Specifically, only collaborative item-item relationships are
implicitly modeled through high-order item-user-item relations. Considering
that items are associated with rich contents in multiple modalities, we argue
that the latent semantic item-item structures underlying these multimodal
contents could be beneficial for learning better item representations and
further boosting recommendation. To this end, we propose a LATent sTructure
mining method for multImodal reCommEndation, which we term LATTICE for brevity.
To be specific, in the proposed LATTICE model, we devise a novel modality-aware
structure learning layer, which learns item-item structures for each modality
and aggregates multiple modalities to obtain latent item graphs. Based on the
learned latent graphs, we perform graph convolutions to explicitly inject
high-order item affinities into item representations. These enriched item
representations can then be plugged into existing collaborative filtering
methods to make more accurate recommendations. Extensive experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art multimedia recommendation methods and validate the efficacy of
mining latent item-item relationships from multimodal features.]]></summary>

the mainstream of the existing work still limits their models with a single
prediction space but completely neglects the way to leverage their model with
multi-prediction spaces. This work fills this gap. For the first time, we
deeply study numerous strategies to perform video forecasting in
multi-prediction spaces and fuse their results together to boost performance.
The prediction in the pixel space usually lacks the ability to preserve the
semantic and structure content of the video however the prediction in the
high-level feature space is prone to generate errors in the reduction and
recovering process. Therefore, we build a recurrent connection between
different feature spaces and incorporate their generations in the upsampling
process. Rather surprisingly, this simple idea yields a much more significant
performance boost than PhyDNet (performance improved by 32.1% MAE on MNIST-2
dataset, and 21.4% MAE on KTH dataset). Both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on four datasets demonstrate the generalization ability and
effectiveness of our approach. We show that our model significantly reduces the
troublesome distortions and blurry artifacts and brings remarkable improvements
to the accuracy in long term video prediction. The code will be released soon.]]></summary>

of data and labels, and thus realize conditional generation. Among them,
auxiliary classifier generative adversarial networks (AC-GAN) have been widely
used, but suffer from the issue of low intra-class diversity on generated
samples. In this paper, we point out that the fundamental reason is that the
classifier of AC-GAN is generator-agnostic, and thus cannot provide informative
guidance to the generator to approximate the target joint distribution, leading
to a minimization of conditional entropy that decreases the intra-class
diversity. Based on this finding, we propose novel cGANs with auxiliary
discriminative classifier (ADC-GAN) to address the issue of AC-GAN.
Specifically, the auxiliary discriminative classifier becomes generator-aware
by distinguishing between the real and fake data while recognizing their
labels. We then optimize the generator based on the auxiliary classifier along
with the original discriminator to match the joint and marginal distributions
of the generated samples with those of the real samples. We provide theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence on synthetic and real-world datasets to

but its acquisition speed is quite slow due to the physiological limitations.
Recently, super-resolution methods have shown excellent performance in
accelerating MRI. In some circumstances, it is difficult to obtain
high-resolution images even with prolonged scan time. Therefore, we proposed a
novel super-resolution method that uses a generative adversarial network (GAN)
with cyclic loss and attention mechanism to generate high-resolution MR images
from low-resolution MR images by a factor of 2. We implemented our model on
pelvic images from healthy subjects as training and validation data, while
those data from patients were used for testing. The MR dataset was obtained
using different imaging sequences, including T2, T2W SPAIR, and mDIXON-W. Four
methods, i.e., BICUBIC, SRCNN, SRGAN, and EDSR were used for comparison.
Structural similarity, peak signal to noise ratio, root mean square error, and
variance inflation factor were used as calculation indicators to evaluate the
performances of the proposed method. Various experimental results showed that
our method can better restore the details of the high-resolution MR image as
compared to the other methods. In addition, the reconstructed high-resolution
MR image can provide better lesion textures in the tumor patients, which is
promising to be used in clinical diagnosis.]]></summary>

requires holistic integration of images, scripts, and sounds based on natural
language processing, temporal dependency, and reasoning. Recently, substantial
attempts have been made on several video datasets with associated question
answering (QA) on a large scale. However, existing evaluation metrics for video
question answering (VideoQA) do not provide meaningful analysis. To make
progress, we argue that a well-made framework, established on the way humans
understand, is required to explain and evaluate the performance of
understanding in detail. Then we propose a top-down evaluation system for
VideoQA, based on the cognitive process of humans and story elements: Cognitive
Modules for Evaluation (CogME). CogME is composed of three cognitive modules:
targets, contents, and thinking. The interaction among the modules in the
understanding procedure can be expressed in one sentence as follows: "I
understand the CONTENT of the TARGET through a way of THINKING." Each module
has sub-components derived from the story elements. We can specify the required
aspects of understanding by annotating the sub-components to individual
questions. CogME thus provides a framework for an elaborated specification of
VideoQA datasets. To examine the suitability of a VideoQA dataset for
validating video understanding intelligence, we evaluated the baseline model of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using multimodal neuroimaging data to characterize brain network is currently
an advanced technique for Alzheimer's disease(AD) Analysis. Over recent years
the neuroimaging community has made tremendous progress in the study of
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) derived from
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)
derived from white matter fiber tractography. However, Due to the heterogeneity
and complexity between BOLD signals and fiber tractography, Most existing
multimodal data fusion algorithms can not sufficiently take advantage of the
complementary information between rs-fMRI and DTI. To overcome this problem, a
novel Hypergraph Generative Adversarial Networks(HGGAN) is proposed in this
paper, which utilizes Interactive Hyperedge Neurons module (IHEN) and Optimal
Hypergraph Homomorphism algorithm(OHGH) to generate multimodal connectivity of
Brain Network from rs-fMRI combination with DTI. To evaluate the performance of
this model, We use publicly available data from the ADNI database to
demonstrate that the proposed model not only can identify discriminative brain
regions of AD but also can effectively improve classification performance.]]></summary>

The text router and image router in Dual-Router accept text modal information

generates fused weights for the fusion of experts. Experts are model backbones

we have tested 12 backbones such as Visual BERT on multimodal dataset Hateful

dementia, but small size of complete multimodal data limits the ability in
representation learning. Moreover, the data distribution inconsistency from
different modalities may lead to ineffective fusion, which fails to
sufficiently explore the intra-modal and inter-modal interactions and
compromises the disease diagnosis performance. To solve these problems, we
proposed a novel multimodal representation learning and adversarial hypergraph
fusion (MRL-AHF) framework for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using complete
trimodal images. First, adversarial strategy and pre-trained model are
incorporated into the MRL to extract latent representations from multimodal
data. Then two hypergraphs are constructed from the latent representations and
the adversarial network based on graph convolution is employed to narrow the
distribution difference of hyperedge features. Finally, the hyperedge-invariant
features are fused for disease prediction by hyperedge convolution. Experiments
on the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative(ADNI) database
demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance on Alzheimer's disease
detection compared with other related models and provides a possible way to
understand the underlying mechanisms of disorder's progression by analyzing the

speakers with only a single target-speaker utterance for reference, can be
effectively achieved by speech representation disentanglement. Existing work
generally ignores the correlation between different speech representations
during training, which causes leakage of content information into the speaker
representation and thus degrades VC performance. To alleviate this issue, we
employ vector quantization (VQ) for content encoding and introduce mutual
information (MI) as the correlation metric during training, to achieve proper
disentanglement of content, speaker and pitch representations, by reducing
their inter-dependencies in an unsupervised manner. Experimental results
reflect the superiority of the proposed method in learning effective
disentangled speech representations for retaining source linguistic content and
intonation variations, while capturing target speaker characteristics. In doing
so, the proposed approach achieves higher speech naturalness and speaker
similarity than current state-of-the-art one-shot VC systems. Our code,
pre-trained models and demo are available at

in misinformed conspiracy theories. Yet, they also offer avenues for conspiracy
theorists to express their doubts and experiences of cognitive dissonance. Such
expressions of dissonance may shed light on who abandons misguided beliefs and
under which circumstances. This paper characterizes self-disclosures of
dissonance about QAnon, a conspiracy theory initiated by a mysterious leader Q
and popularized by their followers, anons in conspiracy theory subreddits. To
understand what dissonance and disbelief mean within conspiracy communities, we
first characterize their social imaginaries, a broad understanding of how
people collectively imagine their social existence. Focusing on 2K posts from
two image boards, 4chan and 8chan, and 1.2 M comments and posts from 12
subreddits dedicated to QAnon, we adopt a mixed methods approach to uncover the
symbolic language representing the movement, expectations, practices, heroes
and foes of the QAnon community. We use these social imaginaries to create a
computational framework for distinguishing belief and dissonance from general
discussion about QAnon. Further, analyzing user engagement with QAnon
conspiracy subreddits, we find that self-disclosures of dissonance correlate
with a significant decrease in user contributions and ultimately with their
departure from the community. We contribute a computational framework for
identifying dissonance self-disclosures and measuring the changes in user
engagement surrounding dissonance. Our work can provide insights into designing
dissonance-based interventions that can potentially dissuade conspiracists from
online conspiracy discussion communities.]]></summary>

the \textit{Source} and the \textit{Target} point sets are separated by large

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detecting 3D landmarks on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is crucial to
assessing and quantifying the anatomical abnormalities in 3D cephalometric
analysis. However, the current methods are time-consuming and suffer from large
biases in landmark localization, leading to unreliable diagnosis results. In
this work, we propose a novel Structure-Aware Long Short-Term Memory framework
(SA-LSTM) for efficient and accurate 3D landmark detection. To reduce the
computational burden, SA-LSTM is designed in two stages. It first locates the
coarse landmarks via heatmap regression on a down-sampled CBCT volume and then
progressively refines landmarks by attentive offset regression using
high-resolution cropped patches. To boost accuracy, SA-LSTM captures
global-local dependence among the cropping patches via self-attention.
Specifically, a graph attention module implicitly encodes the landmark's global
structure to rationalize the predicted position. Furthermore, a novel
attention-gated module recursively filters irrelevant local features and
maintains high-confident local predictions for aggregating the final result.
Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy on an in-house dataset and a public
dataset, achieving 1.64 mm and 2.37 mm average errors, respectively, and using
only 0.5 seconds for inferring the whole CBCT volume of resolution 768*768*576.
Moreover, all predicted landmarks are within 8 mm error, which is vital for
acceptable cephalometric analysis.]]></summary>

adapting an encoder-decoder transfer learning method from computer vision to
investigate the structure among 100 different feature spaces extracted from
hidden representations of various networks trained on language tasks. This
method reveals a low-dimensional structure where language models and
translation models smoothly interpolate between word embeddings, syntactic and
semantic tasks, and future word embeddings. We call this low-dimensional
structure a language representation embedding because it encodes the
relationships between representations needed to process language for a variety
of NLP tasks. We find that this representation embedding can predict how well
each individual feature space maps to human brain responses to natural language

of this structure can be used to create a metric which highlights the brain's
natural language processing hierarchy. This suggests that the embedding

musical pieces are spreading much quickly, and music creation is getting much
easier. The increasing number of musical pieces have made the problem of music
plagiarism prominent. There is an urgent need for a tool that can detect music
plagiarism automatically. Researchers have proposed various methods to extract
low-level and high-level features of music and compute their similarities.
However, low-level features such as cepstrum coefficients have weak relation
with the copyright protection of musical pieces. Existing algorithms
considering high-level features fail to detect the case in which two musical
pieces are not quite similar overall, but have some highly similar regions.
This paper proposes a new method named MESMF, which innovatively converts the
music plagiarism detection problem into the bipartite graph matching task. It
can be solved via the maximum weight matching and edit distances model. We
design several kinds of melody representations and the similarity computation
methods according to the music theory. The proposed method can deal with the
shift, swapping, transposition, and tempo variance problems in music
plagiarism. It can also effectively pick out the local similar regions from two
musical pieces with relatively low global similarity. We collect a new music
plagiarism dataset from real legally-judged music plagiarism cases and conduct
detailed ablation studies. Experimental results prove the excellent performance
of the proposed algorithm. The source code and our dataset are available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multimedia content is of predominance in the modern Web era. Investigating
how users interact with multimodal items is a continuing concern within the
rapid development of recommender systems. The majority of previous work focuses
on modeling user-item interactions with multimodal features included as side
information. However, this scheme is not well-designed for multimedia
recommendation. Specifically, only collaborative item-item relationships are
implicitly modeled through high-order item-user-item relations. Considering
that items are associated with rich contents in multiple modalities, we argue
that the latent semantic item-item structures underlying these multimodal
contents could be beneficial for learning better item representations and
further boosting recommendation. To this end, we propose a LATent sTructure
mining method for multImodal reCommEndation, which we term LATTICE for brevity.
To be specific, in the proposed LATTICE model, we devise a novel modality-aware
structure learning layer, which learns item-item structures for each modality
and aggregates multiple modalities to obtain latent item graphs. Based on the
learned latent graphs, we perform graph convolutions to explicitly inject
high-order item affinities into item representations. These enriched item
representations can then be plugged into existing collaborative filtering
methods to make more accurate recommendations. Extensive experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art multimedia recommendation methods and validate the efficacy of
mining latent item-item relationships from multimodal features.]]></summary>

to study linguistic change. This work explores the word rank dynamics of eight
languages by investigating the Google Books corpus unigram frequency data set.
We observed the rank changes of the unigrams from 1900 to 2008 and compared it
to a Wright-Fisher inspired model that we developed for our analysis. The model
simulates a neutral evolutionary process with the restriction of having no
disappearing words. This work explains the mathematical framework of the model
- written as a Markov Chain with multinomial transition probabilities - to show
how frequencies of words change in time. From our observations in the data and
our model, word rank stability shows two types of characteristics: (1) the
increase/decrease in ranks are monotonic, or (2) the average rank stays the
same. Based on our model, high-ranked words tend to be more stable while
low-ranked words tend to be more volatile. Some words change in ranks in two
ways: (a) by an accumulation of small increasing/decreasing rank changes in
time and (b) by shocks of increase/decrease in ranks. Most of the stopwords and
Swadesh words are observed to be stable in ranks across eight languages. These

usage in the studies of radiation-sensitive populations, e.g., pregnant women,
children, and adults that require longitudinal imaging. Reducing the PET
radiotracer dose or acquisition time reduces photon counts, which can
deteriorate image quality. Recent deep-neural-network (DNN) based methods for
image-to-image translation enable the mapping of low-quality PET images
(acquired using substantially reduced dose), coupled with the associated
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, to high-quality PET images. However,
such DNN methods focus on applications involving test data that match the
statistical characteristics of the training data very closely and give little
attention to evaluating the performance of these DNNs on new
out-of-distribution (OOD) acquisitions. We propose a novel DNN formulation that
models the (i) underlying sinogram-based physics of the PET imaging system and
(ii) the uncertainty in the DNN output through the per-voxel heteroscedasticity
of the residuals between the predicted and the high-quality reference images.
Our sinogram-based uncertainty-aware DNN framework, namely, suDNN, estimates a
standard-dose PET image using multimodal input in the form of (i) a
low-dose/low-count PET image and (ii) the corresponding multi-contrast MRI
images, leading to improved robustness of suDNN to OOD acquisitions. Results on
in vivo simultaneous PET-MRI, and various forms of OOD data in PET-MRI, show
the benefits of suDNN over the current state of the art, quantitatively and
qualitatively.]]></summary>

to many medical applications, such as, image enhancement and disease

applications: (i) the latent space projection and reconstruction of unseen real
images, and (ii) style mixing. We demonstrate the 3D-StyleGAN's performance and
feasibility with ~12,000 three-dimensional full brain MR T1 images, although it
can be applied to any 3D volumetric images. Furthermore, we explore different
configurations of hyperparameters to investigate potential improvement of the

to extract causal relations from natural language requirements in fine-grained

between causes and effects. They also do not allow to split causes and effects
into more granular text fragments (e.g., variable and condition), making the
extracted relations unsuitable for automatic test case derivation. [Objective &
Contributions:] We address this research gap and make the following
contributions: First, we present the Causality Treebank, which is the first
corpus of fully labeled binary parse trees representing the composition of
1,571 causal requirements. Second, we propose a fine-grained causality
extractor based on Recursive Neural Tensor Networks. Our approach is capable of
recovering the composition of causal statements written in natural language and

society since a growing number of users use them for information seeking and
decision making. Therefore, it is crucial to address the potential unfairness
problems in recommendations. Just like users have personalized preferences on
items, users' demands for fairness are also personalized in many scenarios.
Therefore, it is important to provide personalized fair recommendations for
users to satisfy their personalized fairness demands. Besides, previous works
on fair recommendation mainly focus on association-based fairness. However, it
is important to advance from associative fairness notions to causal fairness
notions for assessing fairness more properly in recommender systems. Based on
the above considerations, this paper focuses on achieving personalized
counterfactual fairness for users in recommender systems. To this end, we
introduce a framework for achieving counterfactually fair recommendations
through adversary learning by generating feature-independent user embeddings
for recommendation. The framework allows recommender systems to achieve
personalized fairness for users while also covering non-personalized
situations. Experiments on two real-world datasets with shallow and deep
recommendation algorithms show that our method can generate fairer
recommendations for users with a desirable recommendation performance.]]></summary>

speakers with only a single target-speaker utterance for reference, can be
effectively achieved by speech representation disentanglement. Existing work
generally ignores the correlation between different speech representations
during training, which causes leakage of content information into the speaker
representation and thus degrades VC performance. To alleviate this issue, we
employ vector quantization (VQ) for content encoding and introduce mutual
information (MI) as the correlation metric during training, to achieve proper
disentanglement of content, speaker and pitch representations, by reducing
their inter-dependencies in an unsupervised manner. Experimental results
reflect the superiority of the proposed method in learning effective
disentangled speech representations for retaining source linguistic content and
intonation variations, while capturing target speaker characteristics. In doing
so, the proposed approach achieves higher speech naturalness and speaker

significance of our bias-mitigation approach on downstream NLP applications.
Our proposed methods establish the state-of-the-art performance for debiasing

recently. The task is challenging as it requires abstract problem understanding
and symbolic reasoning with axiomatic knowledge. However, current datasets are
either small in scale or not publicly available. Thus, we construct a new
large-scale benchmark, Geometry3K, consisting of 3,002 geometry problems with
dense annotation in formal language. We further propose a novel geometry
solving approach with formal language and symbolic reasoning, called
Interpretable Geometry Problem Solver (Inter-GPS). Inter-GPS first parses the
problem text and diagram into formal language automatically via rule-based text
parsing and neural object detecting, respectively. Unlike implicit learning in
existing methods, Inter-GPS incorporates theorem knowledge as conditional rules
and performs symbolic reasoning step by step. Also, a theorem predictor is
designed to infer the theorem application sequence fed to the symbolic solver
for the more efficient and reasonable searching path. Extensive experiments on
the Geometry3K and GEOS datasets demonstrate that Inter-GPS achieves
significant improvements over existing methods. The project with code and data

to extract causal relations from natural language requirements in fine-grained

between causes and effects. They also do not allow to split causes and effects
into more granular text fragments (e.g., variable and condition), making the

communicating due to social isolation and quarantine. Also, it was the primary
source of misinformation dissemination on a large scale, referred to as the
infodemic. Therefore, automatic debunking misinformation is a crucial problem.
To tackle this problem, we present two COVID-19 related misinformation datasets
on Twitter and propose a misinformation detection system comprising
network-based and content-based processes based on machine learning algorithms
and NLP techniques. In the network-based process, we focus on social
properties, network characteristics, and users. On the other hand, we classify
misinformation using the content of the tweets directly in the content-based
process, which contains text classification models (paragraph-level and
sentence-level) and similarity models. The evaluation results on the
network-based process show the best results for the artificial neural network
model with an F1 score of 88.68%. In the content-based process, our novel
similarity models, which obtained an F1 score of 90.26%, show an improvement in
the misinformation classification results compared to the network-based models.
In addition, in the text classification models, the best result was achieved
using the stacking ensemble-learning model by obtaining an F1 score of 95.18%.
Furthermore, we test our content-based models on the Constraint@AAAI2021
dataset, and by getting an F1 score of 94.38%, we improve the baseline results.
Finally, we develop a fact-checking website called Checkovid that uses each
process to detect misinformative and informative claims in the domain of
COVID-19 from different perspectives.]]></summary>

Key to our approach is the use of Mixup noise to create similar and dissimilar
examples by mixing data samples differently either at the input or hidden-state
levels. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DACL, we conduct experiments across
various domains such as tabular data, images, and graphs. Our results show that
DACL not only outperforms other domain-agnostic noising methods, such as

SimCLR, to improve self-supervised visual representation learning. Finally, we

research path that has already provided promising results for industries.
However, it is impossible to collect enough data to learn all types of faults

conditions only, were developed to perform unsupervised anomaly detection. A
key issue in the development of these algorithms is the noise in the signals,
as it impacts the anomaly detection performance. In this work, we propose a
powerful data-driven and quasi non-parametric denoising strategy for spectral
data based on a tensor decomposition: the Non-negative Canonical Polyadic (CP)
decomposition. This method is particularly adapted for machine emitting
stationary sound. We demonstrate in a case study, the Malfunctioning Industrial
Machine Investigation and Inspection (MIMII) baseline, how the use of our
denoising strategy leads to a sensible improvement of the unsupervised anomaly

microscopy imagery of living cells, based on a past experiment. This novel
generative adversarial network synthesises a multi-domain sequence of
consecutive timesteps. We showcase Multi-StyleGAN on imagery of multiple live
yeast cells in microstructured environments and train on a dataset recorded in
our laboratory. The simulation captures underlying biophysical factors and time
dependencies, such as cell morphology, growth, physical interactions, as well
as the intensity of a fluorescent reporter protein. An immediate application is
to generate additional training and validation data for feature extraction
algorithms or to aid and expedite development of advanced experimental

with variational inference techniques, enable state-of-the-art sparse
approaches to infer GPs at scale through mini batch-based learning. In this
work, we address one limitation of sparse GPs, which is due to the challenge in
dealing with a large number of inducing variables without imposing a special
structure on the inducing inputs. In particular, we introduce a novel
hierarchical prior, which imposes sparsity on the set of inducing variables. We
treat our model variationally, and we experimentally show considerable
computational gains compared to standard sparse GPs when sparsity on the
inducing variables is realized considering the nearest inducing inputs of a
random mini-batch of the data. We perform an extensive experimental validation
that demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach compared to the

language (NL) user queries is an important but under-studied topic. One of the
challenges in pursuing this direction is the lack of annotated data. To address
this issue, we present the Query-based Video Highlights (QVHighlights) dataset.
It consists of over 10,000 YouTube videos, covering a wide range of topics,
from everyday activities and travel in lifestyle vlog videos to social and
political activities in news videos. Each video in the dataset is annotated
with: (1) a human-written free-form NL query, (2) relevant moments in the video
w.r.t. the query, and (3) five-point scale saliency scores for all
query-relevant clips. This comprehensive annotation enables us to develop and
evaluate systems that detect relevant moments as well as salient highlights for
diverse, flexible user queries. We also present a strong baseline for this
task, Moment-DETR, a transformer encoder-decoder model that views moment
retrieval as a direct set prediction problem, taking extracted video and query
representations as inputs and predicting moment coordinates and saliency scores
end-to-end. While our model does not utilize any human prior, we show that it
performs competitively when compared to well-engineered architectures. With
weakly supervised pretraining using ASR captions, Moment-DETR substantially
outperforms previous methods. Lastly, we present several ablations and
visualizations of Moment-DETR. Data and code is publicly available at

models exhibited discrimination among people based on race, sex, age, etc.
Research has been conducted to measure and mitigate unfairness in machine
learning models. For a machine learning task, it is a common practice to build
a pipeline that includes an ordered set of data preprocessing stages followed
by a classifier. However, most of the research on fairness has considered a
single classifier based prediction task. What are the fairness impacts of the
preprocessing stages in machine learning pipeline? Furthermore, studies showed
that often the root cause of unfairness is ingrained in the data itself, rather
than the model. But no research has been conducted to measure the unfairness
caused by a specific transformation made in the data preprocessing stage. In
this paper, we introduced the causal method of fairness to reason about the
fairness impact of data preprocessing stages in ML pipeline. We leveraged
existing metrics to define the fairness measures of the stages. Then we
conducted a detailed fairness evaluation of the preprocessing stages in 37
pipelines collected from three different sources. Our results show that certain
data transformers are causing the model to exhibit unfairness. We identified a
number of fairness patterns in several categories of data transformers.
Finally, we showed how the local fairness of a preprocessing stage composes in
the global fairness of the pipeline. We used the fairness composition to choose
appropriate downstream transformer that mitigates unfairness in the machine
learning pipeline.]]></summary>

and generalization performance of federated learning (FL) when the aggregation
of devices' knowledge occurs in the gradient space. For example, devices may
differ in terms of data distribution, network latency, input/output space,

local gradients. To improve the tolerance to heterogeneity, we propose a novel
federated prototype learning (FedProto) framework in which the devices and
server communicate the class prototypes instead of the gradients. FedProto
aggregates the local prototypes collected from different devices, and then
sends the global prototypes back to all devices to regularize the training of
local models. The training on each device aims to minimize the classification
error on the local data while keeping the resulting local prototypes
sufficiently close to the corresponding global ones. Through experiments, we
propose a benchmark setting tailored for heterogeneous FL, with FedProto
outperforming several recent FL approaches on multiple datasets.]]></summary>

hardware have wide-ranging benefits, depending on the application, from lower
inference latency to higher data throughput and reduced energy consumption. Two
popular techniques for reducing computation in neural networks are pruning,
removing insignificant synapses, and quantization, reducing the precision of
the calculations. In this work, we explore the interplay between pruning and
quantization during the training of neural networks for ultra low latency
applications targeting high energy physics use cases. Techniques developed for
this study have potential applications across many other domains. We study
various configurations of pruning during quantization-aware training, which we
term quantization-aware pruning, and the effect of techniques like
regularization, batch normalization, and different pruning schemes on
performance, computational complexity, and information content metrics. We find
that quantization-aware pruning yields more computationally efficient models
than either pruning or quantization alone for our task. Further,
quantization-aware pruning typically performs similar to or better in terms of
computational efficiency compared to other neural architecture search
techniques like Bayesian optimization. Surprisingly, while networks with
different training configurations can have similar performance for the
benchmark application, the information content in the network can vary
significantly, affecting its generalizability.]]></summary>

effective exploration is only possible with coherent representations.
Furthermore, we would like to learn representations that not only generalize
across tasks but also accelerate downstream exploration for efficient
task-specific training. To address these challenges we propose Proto-RL, a
self-supervised framework that ties representation learning with exploration
through prototypical representations. These prototypes simultaneously serve as
a summarization of the exploratory experience of an agent as well as a basis
for representing observations. We pre-train these task-agnostic representations
and prototypes on environments without downstream task information. This

networks. In this paper, we propose a fully hyperbolic framework to build
hyperbolic networks based on the Lorentz model by adapting the Lorentz
transformations (including boost and rotation) to formalize essential
operations of neural networks. Moreover, we also prove that linear
transformation in tangent spaces used by existing hyperbolic networks is a
relaxation of the Lorentz rotation and does not include the boost, implicitly
limiting the capabilities of existing hyperbolic networks. The experimental

while keeping the training data on the devices. Most FL schemes are
synchronous: they perform a synchronized aggregation of model updates from
individual devices. Synchronous training can be slow because of late-arriving
devices (stragglers). On the other hand, completely asynchronous training makes
FL less private because of incompatibility with secure aggregation. In this
work, we propose a model aggregation scheme, FedBuff, that combines the best
properties of synchronous and asynchronous FL. Similar to synchronous FL,
FedBuff is compatible with secure aggregation. Similar to asynchronous FL,
FedBuff is robust to stragglers. In FedBuff, clients trains asynchronously and
send updates to the server. The server aggregates client updates in a private
buffer until updates have been received, at which point a server model update
is immediately performed. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for
FedBuff in a non-convex setting. Empirically, FedBuff converges up to 3.8x
faster than previous proposals for synchronous FL (e.g., FedAvgM), and up to
2.5x faster than previous proposals for asynchronous FL (e.g., FedAsync). We
show that FedBuff is robust to different staleness distributions and is more

BASE Layers, while requiring no routing parameters or extra terms in the
objective function such as a load balancing loss, and no sophisticated
assignment algorithm. We study the performance of different hashing techniques,
hash sizes and input features, and show that balanced and random hashes focused
on the most local features work best, compared to either learning clusters or
using longer-range context. We show our approach works well both on large
language modeling and dialogue tasks, and on downstream fine-tuning tasks.]]></summary>

advantages for large-scale applications that rely on collaborative learning,
especially when the training data is either unbalanced or inaccessible due to
privacy constraints. We hypothesize that Federated Averaging underestimates the
full extent of heterogeneity of data when the aggregation is performed. We
propose Precision-weighted Federated Learning a novel algorithm that takes into
account the variance of the stochastic gradients when computing the weighted
average of the parameters of models trained in a Federated Learning setting.
With Precision-weighted Federated Learning, we provide an alternate averaging
scheme that leverages the heterogeneity of the data when it has a large
diversity of features in its composition. Our method was evaluated using
standard image classification datasets with two different data partitioning
strategies (IID/non-IID) to measure the performance and speed of our method in
resource-constrained environments, such as mobile and IoT devices. We obtained
a good balance between computational efficiency and convergence rates with
Precision-weighted Federated Learning. Our performance evaluations show 9%
better predictions with MNIST, 18% with Fashion-MNIST, and 5% with CIFAR-10 in
the non-IID setting. Further reliability evaluations ratify the stability in
our method by reaching a 99% reliability index with IID partitions and 96% with
non-IID partitions. In addition, we obtained a 20x speedup on Fashion-MNIST
with only 10 clients and up to 37x with 100 clients participating in the
aggregation concurrently per communication round. The results indicate that
Precision-weighted Federated Learning is an effective and faster alternative
approach for aggregating private data, especially in domains where data is
highly heterogeneous.]]></summary>

methods with the efficiency of conventional force fields. However, current
ML-FFs typically ignore electronic degrees of freedom, such as the total charge
or spin state, and assume chemical locality, which is problematic when
molecules have inconsistent electronic states, or when nonlocal effects play a
significant role. This work introduces SpookyNet, a deep neural network for
constructing ML-FFs with explicit treatment of electronic degrees of freedom
and quantum nonlocality. Chemically meaningful inductive biases and analytical
corrections built into the network architecture allow it to properly model
physical limits. SpookyNet improves upon the current state-of-the-art (or
achieves similar performance) on popular quantum chemistry data sets. Notably,
it is able to generalize across chemical and conformational space and can
leverage the learned chemical insights, e.g. by predicting unknown spin states,
thus helping to close a further important remaining gap for today's machine
learning models in quantum chemistry.]]></summary>

globally shared model through cycles of model aggregation and local model
training, without the need to share data. Most existing FL methods train local
models separately on different clients, and then simply average their
parameters to obtain a centralized model on the server side. However, these
approaches generally suffer from large aggregation errors and severe local
forgetting, which are particularly bad in heterogeneous data settings. To
tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel FL framework that uses
online Laplace approximation to approximate posteriors on both the client and
server side. On the server side, a multivariate Gaussian product mechanism is
employed to construct and maximize a global posterior, largely reducing the
aggregation errors induced by large discrepancies between local models. On the
client side, a prior loss that uses the global posterior probabilistic
parameters delivered from the server is designed to guide the local training.
Binding such learning constraints from other clients enables our method to
mitigate local forgetting. Finally, we achieve state-of-the-art results on
several benchmarks, clearly demonstrating the advantages of the proposed
method.]]></summary>

errors made when reconstructing accelerated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
data.

Methods: Scan-Specific Artifact Reduction in k-space (SPARK) trains a
convolutional-neural-network to estimate and correct k-space errors made by an
input reconstruction technique by back-propagating from the mean-squared-error
loss between an auto-calibration signal (ACS) and the input technique's
reconstructed ACS. First, SPARK is applied to GRAPPA and demonstrates improved
robustness over other scan-specific models, such as RAKI and residual-RAKI.
Subsequent experiments demonstrate that SPARK synergizes with residual-RAKI to
improve reconstruction performance. SPARK also improves reconstruction quality
when applied to advanced acquisition and reconstruction techniques like 2D
virtual coil (VC-) GRAPPA, 2D LORAKS, 3D GRAPPA without an integrated ACS
region, and 2D/3D wave-encoded images.

Results: SPARK yields 1.5x - 2x RMSE reduction when applied to GRAPPA and
improves robustness to ACS size for various acceleration rates in comparison to
other scan-specific techniques. When applied to advanced reconstruction
techniques such as residual-RAKI, 2D VC-GRAPPA and LORAKS, SPARK achieves up to
20% RMSE improvement. SPARK with 3D GRAPPA also improves performance by ~2x and
perceived image quality without a fully sampled ACS region. Finally, SPARK
synergizes with non-cartesian 2D and 3D wave-encoding imaging by reducing RMSE
between 20-25% and providing qualitative improvements.

Conclusion: SPARK synergizes with physics-based acquisition and
reconstruction techniques to improve accelerated MRI by training scan-specific
models to estimate and correct reconstruction errors in k-space.]]></summary>

non-convex, gradient-based methods have been wildly successful at learning
neural networks in practice. This juxtaposition has led to a number of recent

Unfortunately, the techniques in these works are often highly specific to the
problem studied in each setting, relying on different assumptions on the
distribution, optimization parameters, and network architectures, making it
difficult to generalize across different settings. In this work, we propose a
unified non-convex optimization framework for the analysis of neural network
training. We introduce the notions of proxy convexity and proxy
Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequalities, which are satisfied if the original
objective function induces a proxy objective function that is implicitly
minimized when using gradient methods. We show that stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) on objectives satisfying proxy convexity or the proxy PL inequality leads
to efficient guarantees for proxy objective functions. We further show that
many existing guarantees for neural networks trained by gradient descent can be

cause Recurrent Congestion (RC) patterns is crucial for numerous real-world
applications, including urban planning and scheduling of public transportation

overlooked. This article proposes the ST-Discovery algorithm, a novel
unsupervised spatio-temporal data mining algorithm that facilitates the
effective data-driven discovery of RC dependencies induced by the road network
topology using real-world traffic data. We factor out regularly reoccurring
traffic phenomena, such as rush hours, mainly induced by the daytime, by
modelling and systematically exploiting temporal traffic load outliers. We
present an algorithm that first constructs connected subgraphs of the road
network based on the traffic speed outliers. Second, the algorithm identifies
pairs of subgraphs that indicate spatio-temporal correlations in their traffic
load behaviour to identify topological dependencies within the road network.
Finally, we rank the identified subgraph pairs based on the dependency score
determined by our algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate that
ST-Discovery can effectively reveal topological dependencies in urban road

data has a low intrinsic dimension, at least locally. In this work, we consider
the problem of estimating a $d$ dimensional sub-manifold of $\mathbb{R}^D$ from
a finite set of noisy samples. Assuming that the data was sampled uniformly
from a tubular neighborhood of $\mathcal{M}\in \mathcal{C}^k$, a compact
manifold without boundary, we present an algorithm that takes a point $r$ from
the tubular neighborhood and outputs $\hat p_n\in \mathbb{R}^D$, and
$\widehat{T_{\hat p_n}\mathcal{M}}$ an element in the Grassmanian $Gr(d, D)$.
We prove that as the number of samples $n\to\infty$ the point $\hat p_n$
converges to $p\in \mathcal{M}$ and $\widehat{T_{\hat p_n}\mathcal{M}}$
converges to $T_p\mathcal{M}$ (the tangent space at that point) with high
probability. Furthermore, we show that the estimation yields asymptotic rates
of convergence of $n^{-\frac{k}{2k + d}}$ for the point estimation and
$n^{-\frac{k-1}{2k + d}}$ for the estimation of the tangent space. These rates
are known to be optimal for the case of function estimation.]]></summary>

lives and has affected all aspects of human life. This paper focuses on the
application of deep learning (DL) models to medical imaging and drug discovery
for managing COVID-19 disease. In this article, we detail various medical
imaging-based studies such as X-rays and computed tomography (CT) images along
with DL methods for classifying COVID-19 affected versus pneumonia. The
applications of DL techniques to medical images are further described in terms
of image localization, segmentation, registration, and classification leading
to COVID-19 detection. The reviews of recent papers indicate that the highest
classification accuracy of 99.80% is obtained when InstaCovNet-19 DL method is
applied to an X-ray dataset of 361 COVID-19 patients, 362 pneumonia patients
and 365 normal people. Furthermore, it can be seen that the best classification
accuracy of 99.054% can be achieved when EDL_COVID DL method is applied to a CT
image dataset of 7500 samples where COVID-19 patients, lung tumor patients and
normal people are equal in number. Moreover, we illustrate the potential DL
techniques in drug or vaccine discovery in combating the coronavirus. Finally,
we address a number of problems, concerns and future research directions
relevant to DL applications for COVID-19.]]></summary>

perform conditional generation in a completely unsupervised manner. However,
the salient attributes of unlabeled data in the real-world are mostly
imbalanced. Existing unsupervised conditional GANs cannot properly cluster the

the attributes. To address this problem, we theoretically derive Stein latent
optimization that provides reparameterizable gradient estimations of the latent

latent space. Structurally, we introduce an encoder network and a novel
contrastive loss to help generated data from a single mixture component to
represent a single attribute. We confirm that the proposed method, named Stein
Latent Optimization for GANs (SLOGAN), successfully learns the balanced or
imbalanced attributes and performs unsupervised tasks such as unsupervised
conditional generation, unconditional generation, and cluster assignment even
in the absence of information of the attributes (e.g. the imbalance ratio).
Moreover, we demonstrate that the attributes to be learned can be manipulated

zero-shot transfer to a priori unknown test distributions. However, common
evaluation protocols only test a single, fixed data split in which train and
test classes are assigned randomly. More realistic evaluations should consider
a broad spectrum of distribution shifts with potentially varying degree and
difficulty. In this work, we systematically construct train-test splits of
increasing difficulty and present the ooDML benchmark to characterize
generalization under out-of-distribution shifts in DML. ooDML is designed to
probe the generalization performance on much more challenging, diverse
train-to-test distribution shifts. Based on our new benchmark, we conduct a
thorough empirical analysis of state-of-the-art DML methods. We find that while
generalization tends to consistently degrade with difficulty, some methods are
better at retaining performance as the distribution shift increases. Finally,
we propose few-shot DML as an efficient way to consistently improve
generalization in response to unknown test shifts presented in ooDML. Code

certification of deep neural network classifiers at scale. All prior art on
randomized smoothing has focused on isotropic $\ell_p$ certification, which has
the advantage of yielding certificates that can be easily compared among
isotropic methods via $\ell_p$-norm radius. However, isotropic certification
limits the region that can be certified around an input to worst-case
adversaries, i.e., it cannot reason about other "close", potentially large,
constant prediction safe regions. To alleviate this issue, (i) we theoretically
extend the isotropic randomized smoothing $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ certificates to
their generalized anisotropic counterparts following a simplified analysis.
Moreover, (ii) we propose evaluation metrics allowing for the comparison of
general certificates - a certificate is superior to another if it certifies a
superset region - with the quantification of each certificate through the
volume of the certified region. We introduce ANCER, a practical framework for
obtaining anisotropic certificates for a given test set sample via volume
maximization. Our empirical results demonstrate that ANCER achieves
state-of-the-art $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ certified accuracy on both CIFAR-10 and
ImageNet at multiple radii, while certifying substantially larger regions in
terms of volume, thus highlighting the benefits of moving away from isotropic
analysis. Code used in our experiments is available in

have on a machine learning model. To use differential privacy in machine
learning, data scientists must choose privacy parameters $(\epsilon,\delta)$.
Choosing meaningful privacy parameters is key, since models trained with weak
privacy parameters might result in excessive privacy leakage, while strong
privacy parameters might overly degrade model utility. However, privacy
parameter values are difficult to choose for two main reasons. First, the
theoretical upper bound on privacy loss $(\epsilon,\delta)$ might be loose,
depending on the chosen sensitivity and data distribution of practical
datasets. Second, legal requirements and societal norms for anonymization often
refer to individual identifiability, to which $(\epsilon,\delta)$ are only
indirectly related.

We transform $(\epsilon,\delta)$ to a bound on the Bayesian posterior belief
of the adversary assumed by differential privacy concerning the presence of any
record in the training dataset. The bound holds for multidimensional queries
under composition, and we show that it can be tight in practice. Furthermore,
we derive an identifiability bound, which relates the adversary assumed in
differential privacy to previous work on membership inference adversaries. We
formulate an implementation of this differential privacy adversary that allows
data scientists to audit model training and compute empirical identifiability
scores and empirical $(\epsilon,\delta)$.]]></summary>

decomposition, or robust principal component analysis (PCA), has achieved
stunning performance. However, the selection of the parameters of L+S is
empirical, and the acceleration rate is limited, which are common failings of
iterative compressed sensing MR imaging (CS-MRI) reconstruction methods. Many
deep learning approaches have been proposed to address these issues, but few of
them use a low-rank prior. In this paper, a model-based low-rank plus sparse
network, dubbed L+S-Net, is proposed for dynamic MR reconstruction. In
particular, we use an alternating linearized minimization method to solve the
optimization problem with low-rank and sparse regularization. Learned soft
singular value thresholding is introduced to ensure the clear separation of the
L component and S component. Then, the iterative steps are unrolled into a
network in which the regularization parameters are learnable. We prove that the
proposed L+S-Net achieves global convergence under two standard assumptions.
Experiments on retrospective and prospective cardiac cine datasets show that
the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art CS and existing deep learning
methods and has great potential for extremely high acceleration factors (up to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most important lessons from the success of deep learning is that
learned representations tend to perform much better at any task compared to
representations we design by hand. Yet evolution of evolvability algorithms,
which aim to automatically learn good genetic representations, have received
relatively little attention, perhaps because of the large amount of
computational power they require. The recent method Evolvability ES allows
direct selection for evolvability with little computation. However, it can only
be used to solve problems where evolvability and task performance are aligned.
We propose Quality Evolvability ES, a method that simultaneously optimizes for
task performance and evolvability and without this restriction. Our proposed
approach Quality Evolvability has similar motivation to Quality Diversity
algorithms, but with some important differences. While Quality Diversity aims
to find an archive of diverse and well-performing, but potentially genetically
distant individuals, Quality Evolvability aims to find a single individual with
a diverse and well-performing distribution of offspring. By doing so Quality
Evolvability is forced to discover more evolvable representations. We
demonstrate on robotic locomotion control tasks that Quality Evolvability ES,
similarly to Quality Diversity methods, can learn faster than objective-based
methods and can handle deceptive problems.]]></summary>

nondiscrimination are all demanded already by existing law and regulations -
albeit, in many cases, to an uncertain degree. Next, we discuss the underlying
technical challenges, possible ways for addressing them, and their respective
merits and drawbacks. We notice that distribution shift, spurious correlations,
model underspecification, and data scarcity represent severe challenges in the
medical context (and others) that are very difficult to solve with classical
black-box deep neural networks. Important measures that may help to address
these challenges include the use of large and representative datasets and
federated learning as a means to that end, the careful exploitation of domain

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Human activity recognition (HAR) in ubiquitous computing has been beginning
to incorporate attention into the context of deep neural networks (DNNs), in
which the rich sensing data from multimodal sensors such as accelerometer and
gyroscope is used to infer human activities. Recently, two attention methods
are proposed via combining with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) network, which can capture the dependencies of sensing signals in
both spatial and temporal domains simultaneously. However, recurrent networks
often have a weak feature representing power compared with convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). On the other hand, two attention, i.e., hard attention and
soft attention, are applied in temporal domains via combining with CNN, which
pay more attention to the target activity from a long sequence. However, they
can only tell where to focus and miss channel information, which plays an
important role in deciding what to focus. As a result, they fail to address the
spatial-temporal dependencies of multimodal sensing signals, compared with
attention-based GRU or LSTM. In the paper, we propose a novel dual attention
method called DanHAR, which introduces the framework of blending channel

state-of-the-art performance with negligible overhead of parameters.
Furthermore, visualizing analysis is provided to show that our attention can

interpretation of the predictions of machine learning models based on Shapley
values. While exact calculation of SHAP values is computationally intractable
in general, a recursive polynomial-time algorithm called TreeShap is available
for decision tree models. However, despite its polynomial time complexity,
TreeShap can become a significant bottleneck in practical machine learning
pipelines when applied to large decision tree ensembles. We present
GPUTreeShap, a modified TreeShap algorithm suitable for massively parallel
computation on graphics processing units. Our approach first preprocesses each
decision tree to isolate variable sized sub-problems from the original
recursive algorithm, then solves a bin packing problem, and finally maps
sub-problems to single-instruction, multiple-thread (SIMT) tasks for parallel
execution with specialised hardware instructions. With a single NVIDIA Tesla
V100-32 GPU, we achieve speedups of up to 19x for SHAP values, and speedups of
up to 340x for SHAP interaction values, over a state-of-the-art multi-core CPU
implementation executed on two 20-core Xeon E5-2698 v4 2.2 GHz CPUs. We also
experiment with multi-GPU computing using eight V100 GPUs, demonstrating
throughput of 1.2M rows per second -- equivalent CPU-based performance is
estimated to require 6850 CPU cores.]]></summary>

handful of samples at test time, which has been predominantly tackled with the
idea of meta-learning. However, meta-learning approaches essentially learn
across a variety of few-shot tasks and thus still require large-scale training
data with fine-grained supervision to derive a generalized model, thereby
involving prohibitive annotation cost. In this paper, we advance the few-shot
classification paradigm towards a more challenging scenario, i.e.,
cross-granularity few-shot classification, where the model observes only coarse
labels during training while is expected to perform fine-grained classification
during testing. This task largely relieves the annotation cost since
fine-grained labeling usually requires strong domain-specific expertise. To
bridge the cross-granularity gap, we approximate the fine-grained data
distribution by greedy clustering of each coarse-class into pseudo-fine-classes
according to the similarity of image embeddings. We then propose a
meta-embedder that jointly optimizes the visual- and semantic-discrimination,
in both instance-wise and coarse class-wise, to obtain a good feature space for
this coarse-to-fine pseudo-labeling process. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our
approach on three representative datasets.]]></summary>

millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless communications. To address this issue, in
this paper, we propose a wide beam based training approach to calibrate the
narrow beam direction according to the channel power leakage. To handle the
complex nonlinear properties of the channel power leakage, deep learning is
utilized to predict the optimal narrow beam directly. Specifically, three deep
learning assisted calibrated beam training schemes are proposed. The first
scheme adopts convolution neural network to implement the prediction based on
the instantaneous received signals of wide beam training. We also perform the
additional narrow beam training based on the predicted probabilities for
further beam direction calibrations. However, the first scheme only depends on
one wide beam training, which lacks the robustness to noise. To tackle this
problem, the second scheme adopts long-short term memory (LSTM) network for
tracking the movement of users and calibrating the beam direction according to
the received signals of prior beam training, in order to enhance the robustness
to noise. To further reduce the overhead of wide beam training, our third
scheme, an adaptive beam training strategy, selects partial wide beams to be
trained based on the prior received signals. Two criteria, namely, optimal
neighboring criterion and maximum probability criterion, are designed for the
selection. Furthermore, to handle mobile scenarios, auxiliary LSTM is
introduced to calibrate the directions of the selected wide beams more
precisely. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed schemes achieve
significantly higher beamforming gain with smaller beam training overhead
compared with the conventional and existing deep-learning based counterparts.]]></summary>

to measure the total power consumption of a building. Using an energy
disaggregation method, the consumption of individual appliances can be
estimated from the aggregate measurement. Recent disaggregation algorithms have
significantly improved the performance of NILM systems. However, the
generalization capability of these methods to different houses as well as the
disaggregation of multi-state appliances are still major challenges. In this
paper we address these issues and propose an energy disaggregation approach
based on the variational autoencoders framework. The probabilistic encoder
makes this approach an efficient model for encoding information relevant to the
reconstruction of the target appliance consumption. In particular, the proposed
model accurately generates more complex load profiles, thus improving the power
signal reconstruction of multi-state appliances. Moreover, its regularized
latent space improves the generalization capabilities of the model across
different houses. The proposed model is compared to state-of-the-art NILM
approaches on the UK-DALE and REFIT datasets, and yields competitive results.
The mean absolute error reduces by 18% on average across all appliances
compared to the state-of-the-art. The F1-Score increases by more than 11%,
showing improvements for the detection of the target appliance in the aggregate
measurement.]]></summary>

knowing what those goals are? Generic reinforcement learning agents could be
trained to behave altruistically towards others by rewarding them for
altruistic behaviour, i.e., rewarding them for benefiting other agents in a
given situation. Such an approach assumes that other agents' goals are known so
that the altruistic agent can cooperate in achieving those goals. However,
explicit knowledge of other agents' goals is often difficult to acquire. Even
assuming such knowledge to be given, training of altruistic agents would
require manually-tuned external rewards for each new environment. Thus, it is
beneficial to develop agents that do not depend on external supervision and can
learn altruistic behaviour in a task-agnostic manner. Assuming that other
agents rationally pursue their goals, we hypothesize that giving them more
choices will allow them to pursue those goals better. Some concrete examples
include opening a door for others or safeguarding them to pursue their
objectives without interference. We formalize this concept and propose an
altruistic agent that learns to increase the choices another agent has by
maximizing the number of states that the other agent can reach in its future.
We evaluate our approach on three different multi-agent environments where
another agent's success depends on the altruistic agent's behaviour. Finally,
we show that our unsupervised agents can perform comparably to agents
explicitly trained to work cooperatively. In some cases, our agents can even
outperform the supervised ones.]]></summary>

results of iterative algorithms on a large portion of the D4RL benchmark. The
simple one-step baseline achieves this strong performance without many of the
tricks used by previously proposed iterative algorithms and is more robust to

approaches is a result of the high variance inherent in doing off-policy

the predicted top probability does not reflect the actual accuracy, and tends
to be over-confident. It is commonly believed that such over-confidence is
mainly due to over-parametrization, in particular when the model is large
enough to memorize the training data and maximize the confidence.

In this paper, we show theoretically that over-parametrization is not the
only reason for over-confidence. We prove that logistic regression is
inherently over-confident, in the realizable, under-parametrized setting where
the data is generated from the logistic model, and the sample size is much
larger than the number of parameters. Further, this over-confidence happens for
general well-specified binary classification problems as long as the activation
is symmetric and concave on the positive part. Perhaps surprisingly, we also
show that over-confidence is not always the case -- there exists another
activation function (and a suitable loss function) under which the learned
classifier is under-confident at some probability values. Overall, our theory
provides a precise characterization of calibration in realizable binary

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sparse coding is a class of unsupervised methods for learning a sparse
representation of the input data in the form of a linear combination of a
dictionary and a sparse code. This learning framework has led to
state-of-the-art results in various image and video processing tasks. However,
classical methods learn the dictionary and the sparse code based on alternating
optimizations, usually without theoretical guarantees for either optimality or
convergence due to non-convexity of the problem. Recent works on sparse coding
with a complete dictionary provide strong theoretical guarantees thanks to the
development of the non-convex optimization. However, initial non-convex
approaches learn the dictionary in the sparse coding problem sequentially in an
atom-by-atom manner, which leads to a long execution time. More recent works
seek to directly learn the entire dictionary at once, which substantially
reduces the execution time. However, the associated recovery performance is
degraded with a finite number of data samples. In this paper, we propose an
efficient sparse coding scheme with a two-stage optimization. The proposed
scheme leverages the global and local Riemannian geometry of the two-stage
optimization problem and facilitates fast implementation for superb dictionary
recovery performance by a finite number of samples without atom-by-atom
calculation. We further prove that, with high probability, the proposed scheme
can exactly recover any atom in the target dictionary with a finite number of
samples if it is adopted to recover one atom of the dictionary. An application
on wireless sensor data compression is also proposed. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world data verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the
proposed scheme.]]></summary>

improve the band-utilization efficiency via spectrum sharing or hardware
sharing between radar and communication systems. Since a common radio resource
budget is shared by both functionalities, there exists a tradeoff between the
sensing and communication performance. However, this tradeoff curve is
currently unknown in ISAC systems with human motion recognition tasks based on
deep learning. To fill this gap, this paper formulates and solves a
multi-objective optimization problem which simultaneously maximizes the
recognition accuracy and the communication data rate. The key ingredient of
this new formulation is a nonlinear recognition accuracy model with respect to
the wireless resources, where the model is derived from power function
regression of the system performance of the deep spectrogram network. To avoid
cost-expensive data collection procedures, a primitive-based autoregressive
hybrid (PBAH) channel model is developed, which facilitates efficient training
and testing dataset generation for human motion recognition in a virtual
environment. Extensive results demonstrate that the proposed wireless
recognition accuracy and PBAH channel models match the actual experimental data
very well. Moreover, it is found that the accuracy-rate region consists of a
communication saturation zone, a sensing saturation zone, and a
communication-sensing adversarial zone, of which the third zone achieves the
desirable balanced performance for ISAC systems.]]></summary>

tasks with orders of magnitude less data than standard RL, but meta-training
itself is costly and time-consuming. If we can meta-train on offline data, then
we can reuse the same static dataset, labeled once with rewards for different
tasks, to meta-train policies that adapt to a variety of new tasks at meta-test
time. Although this capability would make meta-RL a practical tool for
real-world use, offline meta-RL presents additional challenges beyond online
meta-RL or standard offline RL settings. Meta-RL learns an exploration strategy
that collects data for adapting, and also meta-trains a policy that quickly
adapts to data from a new task. Since this policy was meta-trained on a fixed,
offline dataset, it might behave unpredictably when adapting to data collected
by the learned exploration strategy, which differs systematically from the
offline data and thus induces distributional shift. We do not want to remove
this distributional shift by simply adopting a conservative exploration
strategy, because learning an exploration strategy enables an agent to collect
better data for faster adaptation. Instead, we propose a hybrid offline meta-RL
algorithm, which uses offline data with rewards to meta-train an adaptive
policy, and then collects additional unsupervised online data, without any
reward labels to bridge this distribution shift. By not requiring reward labels
for online collection, this data can be much cheaper to collect. We compare our
method to prior work on offline meta-RL on simulated robot locomotion and
manipulation tasks and find that using additional unsupervised online data
collection leads to a dramatic improvement in the adaptive capabilities of the
meta-trained policies, matching the performance of fully online meta-RL on a
range of challenging domains that require generalization to new tasks.]]></summary>

consistency theory for R\'enyi divergence estimators. By applying this theory
to neural-network estimators, we show that if a neural network family satisfies
one of several strengthened versions of the universal approximation property
then the corresponding R\'enyi divergence estimator is consistent. In contrast
to density-estimator based methods, our estimators involve only expectations
under $Q$ and $P$ and hence are more effective in high dimensional systems. We
illustrate this via several numerical examples of neural network estimation in

$\smash{\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\theta(G) T})}$ with adversarial losses;
$\mathcal{O}(\theta(G)\operatorname{polylog}{T})$ with stochastic losses; and
$\mathcal{O}(\theta(G)\operatorname{polylog}{T} + \smash{\sqrt{\theta(G) C})}$

$\theta(G)$ is the clique covering number of the graph $G$. Our algorithm is an
instantiation of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader with a novel regularization that
can be seen as a product of a Tsallis entropy component (inspired by Zimmert

stochastic case by Amir et al. (2020)), thus subtly interpolating between the
two forms of entropies. One of our key technical contributions is in

led to an outburst in the amount of data stored digitally. Consequently,
several retrieval systems have been developed depending on the type of data

search for 3D models is non-trivial. Among 3D models, retrieving 3D
Engineering/CAD models or mechanical components is even more challenging due to
the presence of holes, volumetric features, presence of sharp edges etc., which
make CAD a domain unto itself. The research work presented in this paper aims
at developing a dataset suitable for building a retrieval system for 3D CAD
models based on deep learning. 3D CAD models from the available CAD databases
are collected, and a dataset of computer-generated sketch data, termed
'CADSketchNet', has been prepared. Additionally, hand-drawn sketches of the
components are also added to CADSketchNet. Using the sketch images from this
dataset, the paper also aims at evaluating the performance of various retrieval

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[End-to-end text-spotting, which aims to integrate detection and recognition
in a unified framework, has attracted increasing attention due to its
simplicity of the two complimentary tasks. It remains an open problem
especially when processing arbitrarily-shaped text instances. Previous methods
can be roughly categorized into two groups: character-based and
segmentation-based, which often require character-level annotations and/or
complex post-processing due to the unstructured output. Here, we tackle
end-to-end text spotting by presenting Adaptive Bezier Curve Network v2 (ABCNet
v2). Our main contributions are four-fold: 1) For the first time, we adaptively
fit arbitrarily-shaped text by a parameterized Bezier curve, which, compared
with segmentation-based methods, can not only provide structured output but
also controllable representation. 2) We design a novel BezierAlign layer for
extracting accurate convolution features of a text instance of arbitrary
shapes, significantly improving the precision of recognition over previous
methods. 3) Different from previous methods, which often suffer from complex
post-processing and sensitive hyper-parameters, our ABCNet v2 maintains a
simple pipeline with the only post-processing non-maximum suppression (NMS). 4)
As the performance of text recognition closely depends on feature alignment,
ABCNet v2 further adopts a simple yet effective coordinate convolution to
encode the position of the convolutional filters, which leads to a considerable
improvement with negligible computation overhead. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on various bilingual (English and Chinese) benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ABCNet v2 can achieve state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining very high efficiency.]]></summary>

stability from an initial structured signal. In multiple signal domains it has
been shown to yield more discriminative representations compared to other
non-learned representations, and to outperform learned representations in
certain tasks, particularly on limited labeled data and highly structured
signals. The wavelet filters used in the scattering transform are typically
selected to create a tight frame via a parameterized mother wavelet. Focusing
on Morlet wavelets, we propose to instead adapt the scales, orientations, and
slants of the filters to produce problem-specific parametrizations of the
scattering transform. We show that our learned versions of the scattering
transform yield significant performance gains over the standard scattering
transform in the small sample classification settings, and our empirical
results suggest that tight frames may not always be necessary for scattering
transforms to extract effective representations.]]></summary>

for future machine learning systems due to its privacy preservation and
communication efficiency. In beyond-5G/6G systems, it is likely to have
multiple FL groups with different learning purposes. This scenario leads to a
question: How does a wireless network support multiple FL groups? As an answer,
we first propose to use a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) network to guarantee the stable operation of multiple FL processes by
letting the iterations of these FL processes be executed together within a
large-scale coherence time. We then develop a novel scheme that asynchronously
executes the iterations of FL processes under multicasting downlink and
conventional uplink transmission protocols. Finally, we propose a
simple/low-complexity resource allocation algorithm which optimally chooses the
power and computation resources to minimize the execution time of each
iteration of each FL process.]]></summary>

attacks. The adversary can easily change the outputs of DNNs by adding small
well-designed perturbations to inputs. Adversarial example detection is a
fundamental work for robust DNNs-based service. Adversarial examples show the
difference between humans and DNNs in image recognition. From a human-centric
perspective, image features could be divided into dominant features that are
comprehensible to humans, and recessive features that are incomprehensible to
humans, yet are exploited by DNNs. In this paper, we reveal that imperceptible
adversarial examples are the product of recessive features misleading neural
networks, and an adversarial attack is essentially a kind of method to enrich
these recessive features in the image. The imperceptibility of the adversarial
examples indicates that the perturbations enrich recessive features, yet hardly
affect dominant features. Therefore, adversarial examples are sensitive to
filtering off recessive features, while benign examples are immune to such
operation. Inspired by this idea, we propose a label-only adversarial detection
approach that is referred to as feature-filter. Feature-filter utilizes
discrete cosine transform to approximately separate recessive features from
dominant features, and gets a mutant image that is filtered off recessive
features. By only comparing DNN's prediction labels on the input and its
mutant, feature-filter can real-time detect imperceptible adversarial examples
at high accuracy and few false positives.]]></summary>

patient age and the radiographic finding of lung lesion, pneumothorax or

misclassification for some chest x-ray models. Second, we develop
misclassification predictors on chest x-ray models using their outputs and
clinical features. We find that our best performing misclassification

our misclassification identifiers, we develop a corrective algorithm to
selectively flip model predictions that have high likelihood of
misclassification at inference time. We observe F1 improvement on the
prediction of Consolidation (0.008 [95% CI 0.005, 0.010]) and Edema (0.003,

specific instance of an algorithmic problem class, such as the Boolean
satisfiability problem, is called instance-specific algorithm selection. Over

a number of different methods for algorithm selection. Although most of these
methods are based on machine learning, surprisingly little work has been done
on meta learning, that is, on taking advantage of the complementarity of
existing algorithm selection methods in order to combine them into a single
superior algorithm selector. In this paper, we introduce the problem of meta
algorithm selection, which essentially asks for the best way to combine a given
set of algorithm selectors. We present a general methodological framework for
meta algorithm selection as well as several concrete learning methods as
instantiations of this framework, essentially combining ideas of meta learning
and ensemble learning. In an extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate
that ensembles of algorithm selectors can significantly outperform single
algorithm selectors and have the potential to form the new state of the art in
algorithm selection.]]></summary>

methods are mostly based on two-stage frameworks, which include top-down and
bottom-up methods. Two-stage methods either suffer from high computational
redundancy for additional person detectors or they need to group keypoints
heuristically after predicting all the instance-agnostic keypoints. The
single-stage paradigm aims to simplify the multi-person pose estimation
pipeline and receives a lot of attention. However, recent single-stage methods
have the limitation of low performance due to the difficulty of regressing
various full-body poses from a single feature vector. Different from previous
solutions that involve complex heuristic designs, we present a simple yet
effective solution by employing instance-aware dynamic networks. Specifically,
we propose an instance-aware module to adaptively adjust (part of) the network
parameters for each instance. Our solution can significantly increase the
capacity and adaptive-ability of the network for recognizing various poses,
while maintaining a compact end-to-end trainable pipeline. Extensive

but often sacrifice interpretability and computational efficiency.
Interpretability is crucial in many disciplines, such as science and medicine,
where models must be carefully vetted or where interpretation is the goal
itself. Moreover, interpretable models are concise and often yield
computational efficiency. Here, we propose adaptive wavelet distillation (AWD),
a method which aims to distill information from a trained neural network into a
wavelet transform. Specifically, AWD penalizes feature attributions of a neural
network in the wavelet domain to learn an effective multi-resolution wavelet
transform. The resulting model is highly predictive, concise, computationally
efficient, and has properties (such as a multi-scale structure) which make it
easy to interpret. In close collaboration with domain experts, we showcase how
AWD addresses challenges in two real-world settings: cosmological parameter
inference and molecular-partner prediction. In both cases, AWD yields a
scientifically interpretable and concise model which gives predictive
performance better than state-of-the-art neural networks. Moreover, AWD
identifies predictive features that are scientifically meaningful in the
context of respective domains. All code and models are released in a

impressive results in various regression and classification tasks. However, to
achieve these results, there is a high demand for computing and storing
resources. This becomes problematic when, for instance, real-time, mobile
applications are considered, in which the involved (embedded) devices have
limited resources. A common way of addressing this problem is to transform the
original large pre-trained networks into new smaller models, by utilizing Model
Compression and Acceleration (MCA) techniques. Within the MCA framework, we
propose a clustering-based approach that is able to increase the number of
employed centroids/representatives, while at the same time, have an
acceleration gain compared to conventional, $k$-means based approaches. This is
achieved by imposing a special structure to the employed representatives, which
is enabled by the particularities of the problem at hand. Moreover, the
theoretical acceleration gains are presented and the key system
hyper-parameters that affect that gain, are identified. Extensive evaluation
studies carried out using various state-of-the-art DNN models trained in image
classification, validate the superiority of the proposed method as compared for
its use in MCA tasks.]]></summary>

conditionally automated driving. One of the critical factors that quantifies
the safe takeover transition is takeover time. Previous studies identified the
effects of many factors on takeover time, such as takeover lead time,
non-driving tasks, modalities of the takeover requests (TORs), and scenario
urgency. However, there is a lack of research to predict takeover time by
considering these factors all at the same time. Toward this end, we used
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to predict the takeover time using a
dataset from a meta-analysis study [1]. In addition, we used SHAP (SHapley
Additive exPlanation) to analyze and explain the effects of the predictors on
takeover time. We identified seven most critical predictors that resulted in
the best prediction performance. Their main effects and interaction effects on
takeover time were examined. The results showed that the proposed approach
provided both good performance and explainability. Our findings have
implications on the design of in-vehicle monitoring and alert systems to
facilitate the interaction between the drivers and the automated vehicle.]]></summary>

across all industries, such as disease diagnosis in healthcare or quality
assurance in manufacturing. Manual inspection of images, when extended over a
monotonously repetitive period of time is very time consuming and can lead to
anomalies being overlooked.Artificial neural networks have proven themselves
very successful on simple, repetitive tasks, in some cases even outperforming
humans. Therefore, in this paper we investigate different methods of deep
learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, for anomaly detection
applied to a quality assurance use case. We utilize the MVTec anomaly dataset
and develop three different models, a CNN for supervised anomaly detection,
KD-CAE for autoencoder anomaly detection, NI-CAE for noise induced anomaly
detection and a DCGAN for generating reconstructed images. By experiments, we
found that KD-CAE performs better on the anomaly datasets compared to CNN and
NI-CAE, with NI-CAE performing the best on the Transistor dataset. We also
implemented a DCGAN for the creation of new training data but due to
computational limitation and lack of extrapolating the mechanics of AnoGAN, we
restricted ourselves just to the generation of GAN based images. We conclude
that unsupervised methods are more powerful for anomaly detection in images,
especially in a setting where only a small amount of anomalous data is
available, or the data is unlabeled.]]></summary>

certification of deep neural network classifiers at scale. All prior art on
randomized smoothing has focused on isotropic $\ell_p$ certification, which has
the advantage of yielding certificates that can be easily compared among
isotropic methods via $\ell_p$-norm radius. However, isotropic certification
limits the region that can be certified around an input to worst-case
adversaries, i.e., it cannot reason about other "close", potentially large,
constant prediction safe regions. To alleviate this issue, (i) we theoretically
extend the isotropic randomized smoothing $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ certificates to
their generalized anisotropic counterparts following a simplified analysis.
Moreover, (ii) we propose evaluation metrics allowing for the comparison of
general certificates - a certificate is superior to another if it certifies a
superset region - with the quantification of each certificate through the
volume of the certified region. We introduce ANCER, a practical framework for
obtaining anisotropic certificates for a given test set sample via volume
maximization. Our empirical results demonstrate that ANCER achieves
state-of-the-art $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ certified accuracy on both CIFAR-10 and
ImageNet at multiple radii, while certifying substantially larger regions in
terms of volume, thus highlighting the benefits of moving away from isotropic
analysis. Code used in our experiments is available in

recognition, it is still a challenging task to design a calibration-free
system, since there exists a significant variability of EEG signals among
different subjects and recording sessions. As deep learning has received much
research attention in recent years, many efforts have been made to use deep
learning methods for EEG signal recognition. However, existing works mostly
treat deep learning models as blackbox classifiers, while what have been
learned by the models and to which extent they are affected by the noise from
EEG data are still underexplored. In this paper, we develop a novel
convolutional neural network that can explain its decision by highlighting the
local areas of the input sample that contain important information for the
classification. The network has a compact structure for ease of interpretation
and takes advantage of separable convolutions to process the EEG signals in a
spatial-temporal sequence. Results show that the model achieves an average
accuracy of 78.35% on 11 subjects for leave-one-out cross-subject drowsiness
recognition, which is higher than the conventional baseline methods of
53.4%-72.68% and state-of-art deep learning methods of 63.90%-65.61%.
Visualization results show that the model has learned to recognize biologically
explainable features from EEG signals, e.g., Alpha spindles, as strong
indicators of drowsiness across different subjects. In addition, we also
explore reasons behind some wrongly classified samples and how the model is
affected by artifacts and noise in the data. Our work illustrates a promising
direction on using interpretable deep learning models to discover meaning
patterns related to different mental states from complex EEG signals.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising technology to
enable artificial intelligence (AI) at the network edge, where distributed
mobile devices collaboratively train a shared AI model under the coordination
of an edge server. To significantly improve the communication efficiency of FL,
over-the-air computation allows a large number of mobile devices to
concurrently upload their local models by exploiting the superposition property
of wireless multi-access channels. Due to wireless channel fading, the model
aggregation error at the edge server is dominated by the weakest channel among
all devices, causing severe straggler issues. In this paper, we propose a
relay-assisted cooperative FL scheme to effectively address the straggler
issue. In particular, we deploy multiple half-duplex relays to cooperatively
assist the devices in uploading the local model updates to the edge server. The
nature of the over-the-air computation poses system objectives and constraints
that are distinct from those in traditional relay communication systems.
Moreover, the strong coupling between the design variables renders the
optimization of such a system challenging. To tackle the issue, we propose an
alternating-optimization-based algorithm to optimize the transceiver and relay
operation with low complexity. Then, we analyze the model aggregation error in
a single-relay case and show that our relay-assisted scheme achieves a smaller
error than the one without relays provided that the relay transmit power and
the relay channel gains are sufficiently large. The analysis provides critical
insights on relay deployment in the implementation of cooperative FL. Extensive
numerical results show that our design achieves faster convergence compared
with state-of-the-art schemes.]]></summary>

Photoplethysmogram (PPG), and Skin Temperature (ST) sensors embedded in a smart
wristband for detecting physiological stress. The stress detection model is
trained and tested using stress labels obtained from salivary cortisol which is
a clinically established biomarker for physiological stress. A voice-based

integration in a smart home environment is analyzed by simulating a data
acquisition and streaming scenario. We have also proposed a blood pressure
estimation model using PPG signal and advanced regression techniques for
integration with the stress detection model in the wearable health monitoring
system. Finally, the design of a voice-assisted indoor location system is
proposed for integration with the proposed system within a smart home

a critical problem in a variety of domains, including operations research,
informatics, and material design. Yet, current techniques either require
extremely high iteration counts or a large number of random restarts for good
performance. In this work, we propose adapting recent developments in
meta-learning to these many-minima problems by learning the optimization
algorithm for various loss landscapes. We focus on problems from atomic
structural optimization--finding low energy configurations of many-atom
systems--including widely studied models such as bimetallic clusters and
disordered silicon. We find that our optimizer learns a 'hopping' behavior
which enables efficient exploration and improves the rate of low energy minima
discovery. Finally, our learned optimizers show promising generalization with
efficiency gains on never before seen tasks (e.g. new elements or
compositions). Code will be made available shortly.]]></summary>

has achieved great success in learning visual representations without data
annotations. However, most of methods mainly focus on the instance level
information (\ie, the different augmented images of the same instance should
have the same feature or cluster into the same class), but there is a lack of
attention on the relationships between different instances. In this paper, we
introduced a novel SSL paradigm, which we term as relational self-supervised
learning (ReSSL) framework that learns representations by modeling the
relationship between different instances. Specifically, our proposed method
employs sharpened distribution of pairwise similarities among different
instances as \textit{relation} metric, which is thus utilized to match the
feature embeddings of different augmentations. Moreover, to boost the
performance, we argue that weak augmentations matter to represent a more
reliable relation, and leverage momentum strategy for practical efficiency.
Experimental results show that our proposed ReSSL significantly outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both performance and training
efficiency. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/KyleZheng1997/ReSSL}.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The success of deep neural networks in real-world problems has prompted many
attempts to explain their training dynamics and generalization performance, but
more guiding principles for the training of neural networks are still needed.
Motivated by the edge of chaos principle behind the optimal performance of
neural networks, we study the role of various hyperparameters in modern neural
network training algorithms in terms of the order-chaos phase diagram. In
particular, we study a fully analytical feedforward neural network trained on
the widely adopted Fashion-MNIST dataset, and study the dynamics associated
with the hyperparameters in back-propagation during the training process. We
find that for the basic algorithm of stochastic gradient descent with momentum,
in the range around the commonly used hyperparameter values, clear scaling
relations are present with respect to the training time during the ordered
phase in the phase diagram, and the model's optimal generalization power at the
edge of chaos is similar across different training parameter combinations. In
the chaotic phase, the same scaling no longer exists. The scaling allows us to
choose the training parameters to achieve faster training without sacrificing
performance. In addition, we find that the commonly used model regularization
method - weight decay - effectively pushes the model towards the ordered phase
to achieve better performance. Leveraging on this fact and the scaling
relations in the other hyperparameters, we derived a principled guideline for
hyperparameter determination, such that the model can achieve optimal
performance by saturating it at the edge of chaos. Demonstrated on this simple
neural network model and training algorithm, our work improves the
understanding of neural network training dynamics, and can potentially be
extended to guiding principles of more complex model architectures and
algorithms.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to the high communication cost in distributed and federated learning,
methods relying on compressed communication are becoming increasingly popular.
Besides, the best theoretically and practically performing gradient-type
methods invariably rely on some form of acceleration/momentum to reduce the
number of communications (faster convergence), e.g., Nesterov's accelerated
gradient descent (Nesterov, 2004) and Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014). In order to
combine the benefits of communication compression and convergence acceleration,
we propose a \emph{compressed and accelerated} gradient method for distributed
optimization, which we call CANITA. Our CANITA achieves the \emph{first
accelerated rate}
$O\bigg(\sqrt{\Big(1+\sqrt{\frac{\omega^3}{n}}\Big)\frac{L}{\epsilon}} +
\omega\big(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\big)^{\frac{1}{3}}\bigg)$, which improves upon
the state-of-the-art non-accelerated rate
$O\left((1+\frac{\omega}{n})\frac{L}{\epsilon} +
\frac{\omega^2+n}{\omega+n}\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ of DIANA (Khaled et al.,
2020b) for distributed general convex problems, where $\epsilon$ is the target
error, $L$ is the smooth parameter of the objective, $n$ is the number of
machines/devices, and $\omega$ is the compression parameter (larger $\omega$
means more compression can be applied, and no compression implies $\omega=0$).
Our results show that as long as the number of devices $n$ is large (often true
in distributed/federated learning), or the compression $\omega$ is not very
high, CANITA achieves the faster convergence rate
$O\Big(\sqrt{\frac{L}{\epsilon}}\Big)$, i.e., the number of communication
rounds is $O\Big(\sqrt{\frac{L}{\epsilon}}\Big)$ (vs.
$O\big(\frac{L}{\epsilon}\big)$ achieved by previous works). As a result,
CANITA enjoys the advantages of both compression (compressed communication in
each round) and acceleration (much fewer communication rounds).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success for cognitive
applications. The core operation in a DNN is the dot product between quantized
inputs and weights. Prior works exploit the weight/input repetition that arises
due to quantization to avoid redundant computations in Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). However, in this paper we show that their effectiveness is
severely limited when applied to Fully-Connected (FC) layers, which are
commonly used in state-of-the-art DNNs, as it is the case of modern Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformer models.

To improve energy-efficiency of FC computation we present CREW, a hardware
accelerator that implements Computation Reuse and an Efficient Weight Storage
mechanism to exploit the large number of repeated weights in FC layers. CREW
first performs the multiplications of the unique weights by their respective
inputs and stores the results in an on-chip buffer. The storage requirements
are modest due to the small number of unique weights and the relatively small
size of the input compared to convolutional layers. Next, CREW computes each
output by fetching and adding its required products. To this end, each weight
is replaced offline by an index in the buffer of unique products. Indices are
typically smaller than the quantized weights, since the number of unique
weights for each input tends to be much lower than the range of quantized
weights, which reduces storage and memory bandwidth requirements.

Overall, CREW greatly reduces the number of multiplications and provides
significant savings in model memory footprint and memory bandwidth usage. We
evaluate CREW on a diverse set of modern DNNs. On average, CREW provides 2.61x
speedup and 2.42x energy savings over a TPU-like accelerator. Compared to UCNN,
a state-of-art computation reuse technique, CREW achieves 2.10x speedup and
2.08x energy savings on average.]]></summary>

functions. Introductions to deep learning theory commonly present the

avoiding social and economic loss in coastal cities. Compared to the
traditional empirical-based or numerical-based forecasting models, "soft
computing" approaches, including machine learning and deep learning models,
have shown numerous success in recent years. In this paper, we focus on
enabling the deep learning model to learn both short-term and long-term
spatial-temporal dependencies for SWH prediction. A Wavelet Graph Neural
Network (WGNN) approach is proposed to integrate the advantages of wavelet
transform and graph neural network. Several parallel graph neural networks are
separately trained on wavelet decomposed data, and the reconstruction of each
model's prediction forms the final SWH prediction. Experimental results show
that the proposed WGNN approach outperforms other models, including the
numerical models, the machine learning models, and several deep learning

deep learning as a special case, there has been considerable interest in
developing representation learning techniques that can incorporate known
physical constraints into the learned representation. As one example, in many
applications that involve a signal propagating through physical media (e.g.,
optics, acoustics, fluid dynamics, etc), it is known that the dynamics of the
signal must satisfy constraints imposed by the wave equation. Here we propose a
matrix factorization technique that decomposes such signals into a sum of
components, where each component is regularized to ensure that it satisfies
wave equation constraints. Although our proposed formulation is non-convex, we
prove that our model can be efficiently solved to global optimality in
polynomial time. We demonstrate the benefits of our work by applications in
structural health monitoring, where prior work has attempted to solve this
problem using sparse dictionary learning approaches that do not come with any
theoretical guarantees regarding convergence to global optimality and employ
heuristics to capture desired physical constraints.]]></summary>

challenges in deployment in application scenarios with limited memory and
computation capacity. Knowledge distillation is one approach to derive compact
models from bigger ones. However, it has been observed that a converged heavy
teacher model is strongly constrained for learning a compact student network
and could make the optimization subject to poor local optima. In this paper, we
propose ProKT, a new model-agnostic method by projecting the supervision
signals of a teacher model into the student's parameter space. Such projection
is implemented by decomposing the training objective into local intermediate
targets with an approximate mirror descent technique. The proposed method could
be less sensitive with the quirks during optimization which could result in a
better local optimum. Experiments on both image and text datasets show that our

to their interpretability, ease of use, and strong theoretical guarantees.
Cross-validation (CV) is widely used for hyperparameter tuning in these models,
but do practical optimization methods minimize the true out-of-sample loss? A
recent line of research promises to show that the optimum of the CV loss
matches the optimum of the out-of-sample loss (possibly after simple
corrections). It remains to show how tractable it is to minimize the CV loss.
In the present paper, we show that, in the case of ridge regression, the CV
loss may fail to be quasiconvex and thus may have multiple local optima. We can
guarantee that the CV loss is quasiconvex in at least one case: when the
spectrum of the covariate matrix is nearly flat and the noise in the observed
responses is not too high. More generally, we show that quasiconvexity status
is independent of many properties of the observed data (response norm,
covariate-matrix right singular vectors and singular-value scaling) and has a
complex dependence on the few that remain. We empirically confirm our theory
using simulated experiments.]]></summary>

method that has been widely studied in the past decade. In 1bCS, linear samples
of a high dimensional signal are quantized to only one bit per sample (sign of
the measurement). Assuming the original signal vector to be sparse, existing
results either aim to find the support of the vector, or approximate the signal
within an $\epsilon$-ball. The focus of this paper is support recovery, which
often also computationally facilitates approximate signal recovery. A universal
measurement matrix for 1bCS refers to one set of measurements that work for all
sparse signals. With universality, it is known that $\tilde{\Theta}(k^2)$ 1bCS
measurements are necessary and sufficient for support recovery (where $k$
denotes the sparsity). In this work, we show that it is possible to universally
recover the support with a small number of false positives with
$\tilde{O}(k^{3/2})$ measurements. If the dynamic range of the signal vector is
known, then with a different technique, this result can be improved to only
$\tilde{O}(k)$ measurements. Further results on support recovery are also

levels on many AI tasks. Several applications rely more and more on DNNs to
deliver sophisticated services and DNN accelerators are becoming integral

operations per inference and DNN accelerators integrate thousands of
multiply-accumulate units leading to increased energy requirements. Approximate
computing principles are employed to significantly lower the energy consumption
of DNN accelerators at the cost of some accuracy loss. Nevertheless, recent
research demonstrated that complex DNNs are increasingly sensitive to

targeting tight accuracy constraints. In this work, we present a dynamically

exact, positive error, and negative error. In addition, we propose a
filter-oriented approximation method to map the weights to the appropriate
modes of the approximate multiplier. Our mapping algorithm balances the
positive with the negative errors due to the approximate multiplications,
aiming at maximizing the energy reduction while minimizing the overall
convolution error. We evaluate our approach on multiple DNNs and datasets

reward. Neural-guided search provides a flexible means of searching these
combinatorial spaces using an autoregressive recurrent neural network. A major
benefit of this approach is that builds up objects sequentially--this provides
an opportunity to incorporate domain knowledge into the search by directly
modifying the logits emitted during sampling. In this work, we formalize a
framework for incorporating such in situ priors and constraints into
neural-guided search, and provide sufficient conditions for enforcing

speech processing. With recent state-of-the-art attention-based automatic
speech recognition (ASR) structure, NAR can realize promising real-time factor
(RTF) improvement with only small degradation of accuracy compared to the
autoregressive (AR) models. However, the recognition inference needs to wait
for the completion of a full speech utterance, which limits their applications
on low latency scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end
streaming NAR speech recognition system by combining blockwise-attention and
connectionist temporal classification with mask-predict (Mask-CTC) NAR. During
inference, the input audio is separated into small blocks and then processed in
a blockwise streaming way. To address the insertion and deletion error at the
edge of the output of each block, we apply an overlapping decoding strategy
with a dynamic mapping trick that can produce more coherent sentences.
Experimental results show that the proposed method improves online ASR
recognition in low latency conditions compared to vanilla Mask-CTC. Moreover,
it can achieve a much faster inference speed compared to the AR attention-based
models. All of our codes will be publicly available at

used to address two challenges that autonomous systems face when they endeavor
to learn from, adapt to, and collaborate with humans : (1) identifying the
human's intent and (2) safely optimizing the autonomous system's behavior to
achieve this inferred intent. First, we use the offline dataset to efficiently
infer the human's reward function via pool-based active preference learning.
Second, given this learned reward function, we perform offline reinforcement
learning to optimize a policy based on the inferred human intent. Crucially,
our proposed approach does not require actual physical rollouts or an accurate
simulator for either the reward learning or policy optimization steps, enabling
both safe and efficient apprenticeship learning. We identify and evaluate our
approach on a subset of existing offline RL benchmarks that are well suited for
offline reward learning and also evaluate extensions of these benchmarks which
allow more open-ended behaviors. Our experiments show that offline
preference-based reward learning followed by offline reinforcement learning
enables efficient and high-performing policies, while only requiring small

described by a vector of parameters $\theta$, and realized as a piecewise
linear continuous function $R_{\theta}: x \in \mathbb R^{d} \mapsto
R_{\theta}(x) \in \mathbb R^{k}$. Natural scalings and permutations operations
on the parameters $\theta$ leave the realization unchanged, leading to
equivalence classes of parameters that yield the same realization. These
considerations in turn lead to the notion of identifiability -- the ability to
recover (the equivalence class of) $\theta$ from the sole knowledge of its
realization $R_{\theta}$. The overall objective of this paper is to introduce
an embedding for ReLU neural networks of any depth, $\Phi(\theta)$, that is
invariant to scalings and that provides a locally linear parameterization of
the realization of the network. Leveraging these two key properties, we derive
some conditions under which a deep ReLU network is indeed locally identifiable
from the knowledge of the realization on a finite set of samples $x_{i} \in
\mathbb R^{d}$. We study the shallow case in more depth, establishing necessary

able to compose skills and concepts in novel ways, regardless of whether the

existing models have much to improve upon towards handling new compositions. We
present a novel method for learning to compose skills and concepts that
separates these two factors implicitly within a model by learning grounded
concept representations and disentangling the encoding of skills from that of

genetic programming for finding accurate and trustworthy prediction models for
this task. However, it is not straight-forward how nominal variables can be
included. In particular, a one-hot-encoding is unsatisfactory because genetic
programming tends to remove such indicator variables. We have therefore used
so-called factor variables for representing nominal variables in symbolic
regression models. Our results show that GP is able to produce symbolic

has low variance, and can be used with differentiable and non-differentiable

models. Exemplar VAE, as a variant of VAE with an exemplar-based prior, has
achieved impressive results. However, due to the nature of model design, an
exemplar-based model usually requires vast amounts of data to participate in
training, which leads to huge computational complexity. To address this issue,
we propose Bayesian Pseudocoresets Exemplar VAE (ByPE-VAE), a new variant of
VAE with a prior based on Bayesian pseudocoreset. The proposed prior is
conditioned on a small-scale pseudocoreset rather than the whole dataset for
reducing the computational cost and avoiding overfitting. Simultaneously, we
obtain the optimal pseudocoreset via a stochastic optimization algorithm during
VAE training aiming to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the
prior based on the pseudocoreset and that based on the whole dataset.
Experimental results show that ByPE-VAE can achieve competitive improvements
over the state-of-the-art VAEs in the tasks of density estimation,
representation learning, and generative data augmentation. Particularly, on a
basic VAE architecture, ByPE-VAE is up to 3 times faster than Exemplar VAE
while almost holding the performance. Code is available at our supplementary

still very useful, e.g, Search Engines (Google Chrome). Speeding them up, in
small additional space with respect to the table being searched into, is still
a quite significant achievement. Static Learned Indexes have been very
successful in achieving such a speed-up, but leave open a major question: To
what extent one can enjoy the speed-up of Learned Indexes while using constant
or nearly constant additional space. By generalizing the experimental
methodology of a recent benchmarking study on Learned Indexes, we shed light on
this question, by considering two scenarios. The first, quite elementary, i.e.,
textbook code, and the second using advanced Learned Indexing algorithms and
the supporting sophisticated software platforms. Although in both cases one
would expect a positive answer, its achievement is not as simple as it seems.
Indeed, our extensive set of experiments reveal a complex relationship between

corresponding quantitative estimates, across memory levels, can be of interest
to algorithm designers and of use to practitioners as well. As an essential
part of our research, we introduce two new models that are of interest in their
own right. The first is a constant space model that can be seen as a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph neural networks (GNNs) are naturally distributed architectures for
learning representations from network data. This renders them suitable
candidates for decentralized tasks. In these scenarios, the underlying graph
often changes with time due to link failures or topology variations, creating a
mismatch between the graphs on which GNNs were trained and the ones on which
they are tested. Online learning can be leveraged to retrain GNNs at testing
time to overcome this issue. However, most online algorithms are centralized
and usually offer guarantees only on convex problems, which GNNs rarely lead
to. This paper develops the Wide and Deep GNN (WD-GNN), a novel architecture
that can be updated with distributed online learning mechanisms. The WD-GNN
consists of two components: the wide part is a linear graph filter and the deep
part is a nonlinear GNN. At training time, the joint wide and deep architecture
learns nonlinear representations from data. At testing time, the wide, linear
part is retrained, while the deep, nonlinear one remains fixed. This often
leads to a convex formulation. We further propose a distributed online learning
algorithm that can be implemented in a decentralized setting. We also show the
stability of the WD-GNN to changes of the underlying graph and analyze the
convergence of the proposed online learning procedure. Experiments on movie
recommendation, source localization and robot swarm control corroborate
theoretical findings and show the potential of the WD-GNN for distributed
online learning.]]></summary>

small variations can distort the dynamics described by trajectory data. This
work builds on operator inference from scientific machine learning to infer
low-dimensional models from high-dimensional state trajectories polluted with
noise. The presented analysis shows that, under certain conditions, the
inferred operators are unbiased estimators of the well-studied projection-based
reduced operators from traditional model reduction. Furthermore, the connection
between operator inference and projection-based model reduction enables
bounding the mean-squared errors of predictions made with the learned models
with respect to traditional reduced models. The analysis also motivates an
active operator inference approach that judiciously samples high-dimensional
trajectories with the aim of achieving a low mean-squared error by reducing the
effect of noise. Numerical experiments with high-dimensional linear and
nonlinear state dynamics demonstrate that predictions obtained with active
operator inference have orders of magnitude lower mean-squared errors than
operator inference with traditional, equidistantly sampled trajectory data.]]></summary>

with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We find empirically that long after
performance has converged, networks continue to move through parameter space by
a process of anomalous diffusion in which distance travelled grows as a power
law in the number of gradient updates with a nontrivial exponent. We reveal an
intricate interaction between the hyperparameters of optimization, the
structure in the gradient noise, and the Hessian matrix at the end of training
that explains this anomalous diffusion. To build this understanding, we first
derive a continuous-time model for SGD with finite learning rates and batch
sizes as an underdamped Langevin equation. We study this equation in the
setting of linear regression, where we can derive exact, analytic expressions
for the phase space dynamics of the parameters and their instantaneous
velocities from initialization to stationarity. Using the Fokker-Planck
equation, we show that the key ingredient driving these dynamics is not the
original training loss, but rather the combination of a modified loss, which
implicitly regularizes the velocity, and probability currents, which cause
oscillations in phase space. We identify qualitative and quantitative
predictions of this theory in the dynamics of a ResNet-18 model trained on
ImageNet. Through the lens of statistical physics, we uncover a mechanistic
origin for the anomalous limiting dynamics of deep neural networks trained with
SGD.]]></summary>

failure of some of the agents observed from the command base. It is generally
difficult to distinguish whether the failure is caused by actuators
(hypothesis, $h_a$) or sensors (hypothesis, $h_s$) solely by the communication
between the command base and the concerning agent. By making a collision to the
agent by another, we would be able to distinguish which hypothesis is likely:
For $h_a$, we expect to detect corresponding displacements while for $h_a$ we
do not. Such swarm strategies to grasp the situation are preferably to be
generated autonomously by artificial intelligence (AI). Preferable actions
($e.g.$, the collision) for the distinction would be those maximizing the
difference between the expected behaviors for each hypothesis, as a value
function. Such actions exist, however, only very sparsely in the whole
possibilities, for which the conventional search based on gradient methods does
not make sense. Instead, we have successfully applied the reinforcement
learning technique, achieving the maximization of such a sparse value function.
The machine learning actually concluded autonomously the colliding action to
distinguish the hypothesises. Getting recognized an agent with actuator error
by the action, the agents behave as if other ones want to assist the
malfunctioning one to achieve a given mission.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper presents a constrained policy gradient algorithm. We introduce
constraints for safe learning with the following steps. First, learning is
slowed down (lazy learning) so that the episodic policy change can be computed
with the help of the policy gradient theorem and the neural tangent kernel.
Then, this enables us the evaluation of the policy at arbitrary states too. In
the same spirit, learning can be guided, ensuring safety via augmenting episode
batches with states where the desired action probabilities are prescribed.
Finally, exogenous discounted sum of future rewards (returns) can be computed
at these specific state-action pairs such that the policy network satisfies
constraints. Computing the returns is based on solving a system of linear
equations (equality constraints) or a constrained quadratic program (inequality
constraints). Simulation results suggest that adding constraints (external
information) to the learning can improve learning in terms of speed and safety
reasonably if constraints are appropriately selected. The efficiency of the
constrained learning was demonstrated with a shallow and wide ReLU network in
the Cartpole and Lunar Lander OpenAI gym environments. The main novelty of the
paper is giving a practical use of the neural tangent kernel in reinforcement
learning.]]></summary>

promising successes in approximate inference for complex distributions.
However, their empirical performance depends crucially on the choice of optimal

previous approaches which has been proved sub-optimal. Inspired by the paradigm
of multiple kernel learning, our solution to this issue is using a combination
of multiple kernels to approximate the optimal kernel instead of a single one
which may limit the performance and flexibility. To do so, we extend Kernelized
Stein Discrepancy (KSD) to its multiple kernel view called Multiple Kernelized
Stein Discrepancy (MKSD). Further, we leverage MKSD to construct a general
algorithm based on SVGD, which be called Multiple Kernel SVGD (MK-SVGD).
Besides, we automatically assign a weight to each kernel without any other
parameters. The proposed method not only gets rid of optimal kernel dependence
but also maintains computational effectiveness. Experiments on various tasks
and models show the effectiveness of our method.]]></summary>

Resonance (MR) image acquisition can cause image artifacts. Motion correction
techniques have been proposed to compensate for these types of motion during
thoracic scans, relying on accurate motion estimation from undersampled
motion-resolved reconstruction. A particular interest and challenge lie in the
derivation of reliable non-rigid motion fields from the undersampled
motion-resolved data. Motion estimation is usually formulated in image space
via diffusion, parametric-spline, or optical flow methods. However, image-based
registration can be impaired by remaining aliasing artifacts due to the
undersampled motion-resolved reconstruction. In this work, we describe a
formalism to perform non-rigid registration directly in the sampled Fourier
space, i.e. k-space. We propose a deep-learning based approach to perform fast
and accurate non-rigid registration from the undersampled k-space data. The
basic working principle originates from the Local All-Pass (LAP) technique, a
recently introduced optical flow-based registration. The proposed LAPNet is
compared against traditional and deep learning image-based registrations and
tested on fully-sampled and highly-accelerated (with two undersampling
strategies) 3D respiratory motion-resolved MR images in a cohort of 40 patients

surveillance applications that capture visual data from a bird's-eye
perspective. This leaves aside precious relationships and visual cues that
could be captured through a first-person view of a scene. In this work, we
propose a strategy to exploit the power of current game engines, such as Unity,
to transform pre-existing bird's-eye view datasets into a first-person view, in
particular, a depth view. Using this strategy, we are able to generate large
volumes of synthetic data that can be used to pre-train a social navigation
model. To test our ideas, we present DeepSocNav, a deep learning based model
that takes advantage of the proposed approach to generate synthetic data.
Furthermore, DeepSocNav includes a self-supervised strategy that is included as
an auxiliary task. This consists of predicting the next depth frame that the
agent will face. Our experiments show the benefits of the proposed model that

popular. However, it is still challenging to propose a robust makeup transfer
method in the real-world environment. Current makeup transfer methods mostly
work well on good-conditioned clean makeup images, but transferring makeup that
exhibits shadow and occlusion is not satisfying. To alleviate it, we propose a
novel makeup transfer method, called 3D-Aware Shadow and Occlusion Robust GAN
(SOGAN). Given the source and the reference faces, we first fit a 3D face model
and then disentangle the faces into shape and texture. In the texture branch,
we map the texture to the UV space and design a UV texture generator to
transfer the makeup. Since human faces are symmetrical in the UV space, we can
conveniently remove the undesired shadow and occlusion from the reference image
by carefully designing a Flip Attention Module (FAM). After obtaining cleaner
makeup features from the reference image, a Makeup Transfer Module (MTM) is
introduced to perform accurate makeup transfer. The qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate that our SOGAN not only achieves superior
results in shadow and occlusion situations but also performs well in large pose
and expression variations.]]></summary>

imaging due to their promising pattern recognition capabilities. However, Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs) require a huge amount of data, and because of the lack
of sufficient data in this field, transfer learning can be a great solution.
DNNs used for disease diagnosis meticulously concentrate on improving the
accuracy of predictions without providing a figure about their confidence of
predictions. Knowing how much a DNN model is confident in a computer-aided
diagnosis model is necessary for gaining clinicians' confidence and trust in
DL-based solutions. To address this issue, this work presents three different
methods for quantifying uncertainties for skin cancer detection from images. It
also comprehensively evaluates and compares performance of these DNNs using
novel uncertainty-related metrics. The obtained results reveal that the
predictive uncertainty estimation methods are capable of flagging risky and
erroneous predictions with a high uncertainty estimate. We also demonstrate
that ensemble approaches are more reliable in capturing uncertainties through

a novel topic, weakly-supervised semantic segmentation in cityscape via HSIs.
It is based on the idea that high-resolution HSIs in city scenes contain rich
spectral information, which can be easily associated to semantics without
manual labeling. Therefore, it enables low cost, highly reliable semantic
segmentation in complex scenes. Specifically, in this paper, we theoretically
analyze the HSIs and introduce a weakly-supervised HSI semantic segmentation
framework, which utilizes spectral information to improve the coarse labels to
a finer degree. The experimental results show that our method can obtain highly
competitive labels and even have higher edge fineness than artificial fine
labels in some classes. At the same time, the results also show that the
refined labels can effectively improve the effect of semantic segmentation. The

human-computer interaction. Early methods focus on extracting appearance and
geometry features associated with human affects, while ignoring the latent
semantic information among individual facial changes, leading to limited
performance and generalization. Recent work attempts to establish a graph-based
representation to model these semantic relationships and develop frameworks to
leverage them for various FAA tasks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive
review of graph-based FAA, including the evolution of algorithms and their
applications. First, the FAA background knowledge is introduced, especially on
the role of the graph. We then discuss approaches that are widely used for
graph-based affective representation in literature and show a trend towards
graph construction. For the relational reasoning in graph-based FAA, existing
studies are categorized according to their usage of traditional methods or deep
models, with a special emphasis on the latest graph neural networks.
Performance comparisons of the state-of-the-art graph-based FAA methods are
also summarized. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential directions.
As far as we know, this is the first survey of graph-based FAA methods. Our
findings can serve as a reference for future research in this field.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The two leading hypotheses for the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) in the
$\textit{Fermi}$ data are an unresolved population of faint millisecond pulsars
(MSPs) and dark-matter (DM) annihilation. The dichotomy between these
explanations is typically reflected by modeling them as two separate emission
components. However, point-sources (PSs) such as MSPs become statistically
degenerate with smooth Poisson emission in the ultra-faint limit (formally
where each source is expected to contribute much less than one photon on
average), leading to an ambiguity that can render questions such as whether the
emission is PS-like or Poissonian in nature ill-defined. We present a
conceptually new approach that describes the PS and Poisson emission in a
unified manner and only afterwards derives constraints on the Poissonian
component from the so obtained results. For the implementation of this
approach, we leverage deep learning techniques, centered around a neural
network-based method for histogram regression that expresses uncertainties in
terms of quantiles. We demonstrate that our method is robust against a number
of systematics that have plagued previous approaches, in particular DM / PS
misattribution. In the $\textit{Fermi}$ data, we find a faint GCE described by
a median source-count distribution (SCD) peaked at a flux of $\sim4 \times
10^{-11} \ \text{counts} \ \text{cm}^{-2} \ \text{s}^{-1}$ (corresponding to
$\sim3 - 4$ expected counts per PS), which would require $N \sim
\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ sources to explain the entire excess (median value $N =
\text{29,300}$ across the sky). Although faint, this SCD allows us to derive
the constraint $\eta_P \leq 66\%$ for the Poissonian fraction of the GCE flux
$\eta_P$ at 95% confidence, suggesting that a substantial amount of the GCE
flux is due to PSs.]]></summary>

consecutive timesteps. We showcase Multi-StyleGAN on imagery of multiple live
yeast cells in microstructured environments and train on a dataset recorded in
our laboratory. The simulation captures underlying biophysical factors and time
dependencies, such as cell morphology, growth, physical interactions, as well
as the intensity of a fluorescent reporter protein. An immediate application is
to generate additional training and validation data for feature extraction
algorithms or to aid and expedite development of advanced experimental
techniques such as online monitoring or control of cells.

Availability of sufficient pixel-level annotations for the training data is a
hurdle. Active learning helps learning from small amounts of data by suggesting
the most promising samples for labeling. In this work, we propose a new
pool-based method for active learning, which proposes promising patches
extracted from full image, in each acquisition step. The problem is framed in
an exploration-exploitation framework by combining an embedding based on
Uniform Manifold Approximation to model representativeness with entropy as
uncertainty measure to model informativeness. We applied our proposed method to
the autonomous driving datasets CamVid and Cityscapes and performed a
quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art baselines. We find that our

solutions for interactive tasks in large-scale realistic scenes. Our
environment contains 15 fully interactive home-sized scenes with 108 rooms
populated with rigid and articulated objects. The scenes are replicas of
real-world homes, with distribution and the layout of objects aligned to those
of the real world. iGibson 1.0 integrates several key features to facilitate
the study of interactive tasks: i) generation of high-quality virtual sensor
signals (RGB, depth, segmentation, LiDAR, flow and so on), ii) domain
randomization to change the materials of the objects (both visual and physical)
and/or their shapes, iii) integrated sampling-based motion planners to generate
collision-free trajectories for robot bases and arms, and iv) intuitive
human-iGibson interface that enables efficient collection of human
demonstrations. Through experiments, we show that the full interactivity of the
scenes enables agents to learn useful visual representations that accelerate
the training of downstream manipulation tasks. We also show that iGibson 1.0
features enable the generalization of navigation agents, and that the
human-iGibson interface and integrated motion planners facilitate efficient
imitation learning of human demonstrated (mobile) manipulation behaviors.
iGibson 1.0 is open-source, equipped with comprehensive examples and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning techniques for 3D brain vessel image segmentation have not been
as successful as in the segmentation of other organs and tissues. This can be
explained by two factors. First, deep learning techniques tend to show poor
performances at the segmentation of relatively small objects compared to the
size of the full image. Second, due to the complexity of vascular trees and the
small size of vessels, it is challenging to obtain the amount of annotated
training data typically needed by deep learning methods. To address these
problems, we propose a novel annotation-efficient deep learning vessel
segmentation framework. The framework avoids pixel-wise annotations, only
requiring weak patch-level labels to discriminate between vessel and non-vessel
2D patches in the training set, in a setup similar to the CAPTCHAs used to
differentiate humans from bots in web applications. The user-provided weak
annotations are used for two tasks: 1) to synthesize pixel-wise pseudo-labels
for vessels and background in each patch, which are used to train a
segmentation network, and 2) to train a classifier network. The classifier
network allows to generate additional weak patch labels, further reducing the
annotation burden, and it acts as a noise filter for poor quality images. We
use this framework for the segmentation of the cerebrovascular tree in
Time-of-Flight angiography (TOF) and Susceptibility-Weighted Images (SWI). The
results show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while
reducing the annotation time by ~77% w.r.t. learning-based segmentation methods
using pixel-wise labels for training.]]></summary>

protoplanetary disk, are often interpreted as signatures of embedded planets.
Fitting a model of planetary gaps to these observed features using customized
simulations or empirical relations can reveal the characteristics of the hidden
planets. However, customized fitting is often impractical owing to the
increasing sample size and the complexity of disk-planet interaction. In this
paper we introduce the architecture of DPNNet-2.0, second in the series after
DPNNet \citep{aud20}, designed using a Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN, here
specifically ResNet50) for predicting exoplanet masses directly from simulated
images of protoplanetary disks hosting a single planet. DPNNet-2.0 additionally
consists of a multi-input framework that uses both a CNN and multi-layer
perceptron (a class of artificial neural network) for processing image and disk
parameters simultaneously. This enables DPNNet-2.0 to be trained using images
directly, with the added option of considering disk parameters (disk
viscosities, disk temperatures, disk surface density profiles, dust abundances,
and particle Stokes numbers) generated from disk-planet hydrodynamic
simulations as inputs. This work provides the required framework and is the
first step towards the use of computer vision (implementing CNN) to directly
extract mass of an exoplanet from planetary gaps observed in dust-surface
density maps by telescopes such as the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimeter Array.]]></summary>

exploration, using jointly their senses of vision and touch. However, in 3D
shape reconstruction, most recent progress has relied on static datasets of
limited sensory data such as RGB images, depth maps or haptic readings, leaving
the active exploration of the shape largely unexplored. In active touch sensing
for 3D reconstruction, the goal is to actively select the tactile readings that
maximize the improvement in shape reconstruction accuracy. However, the
development of deep learning-based active touch models is largely limited by
the lack of frameworks for shape exploration. In this paper, we focus on this
problem and introduce a system composed of: 1) a haptic simulator leveraging
high spatial resolution vision-based tactile sensors for active touching of 3D
objects; 2) a mesh-based 3D shape reconstruction model that relies on tactile
or visuotactile signals; and 3) a set of data-driven solutions with either
tactile or visuotactile priors to guide the shape exploration. Our framework
enables the development of the first fully data-driven solutions to active
touch on top of learned models for object understanding. Our experiments show
the benefits of such solutions in the task of 3D shape understanding where our
models consistently outperform natural baselines. We provide our framework as a
tool to foster future research in this direction.]]></summary>

effective for strengthening the context modeling ability in convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). However, its pixel-wise computational overhead is
prohibitive which renders it unsuitable for high resolution imagery. In this
paper, we explore the efficiency of context graph reasoning and propose a novel
framework called Squeeze Reasoning. Instead of propagating information on the
spatial map, we first learn to squeeze the input feature into a channel-wise
global vector and perform reasoning within the single vector where the
computation cost can be significantly reduced. Specifically, we build the node
graph in the vector where each node represents an abstract semantic concept.
The refined feature within the same semantic category results to be consistent,
which is thus beneficial for downstream tasks. We show that our approach can be
modularized as an end-to-end trained block and can be easily plugged into

growth in the inflation rate has compelled people to invest in the stock and
commodity markets and other areas rather than saving. Further, the ability of
Deep Learning models to make predictions on the time series data has been
proven time and again. Technical analysis on the stock market with the help of
technical indicators has been the most common practice among traders and
investors. One more aspect is the sentiment analysis - the emotion of the
investors that shows the willingness to invest. A variety of techniques have
been used by people around the globe involving basic Machine Learning and
Neural Networks. Ranging from the basic linear regression to the advanced
neural networks people have experimented with all possible techniques to
predict the stock market. It's evident from recent events how news and
headlines affect the stock markets and cryptocurrencies. This paper proposes an
ensemble of state-of-the-art methods for predicting stock prices. Firstly
sentiment analysis of the news and the headlines for the company Apple Inc,
listed on the NASDAQ is performed using a version of BERT, which is a
pre-trained transformer model by Google for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Afterward, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) predicts the stock price for
Apple Inc using the technical indicators, stock indexes of various countries,
some commodities, and historical prices along with the sentiment scores.
Comparison is done with baseline models like - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM),
Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), vanilla GAN, and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) model.]]></summary>

questions given input images. They are a testbed for learning high-level
reasoning with a primary use in HCI, for instance assistance for the visually
impaired. Recent research has shown that state-of-the-art models tend to
produce answers exploiting biases and shortcuts in the training data, and
sometimes do not even look at the input image, instead of performing the
required reasoning steps. We present VisQA, a visual analytics tool that
explores this question of reasoning vs. bias exploitation. It exposes the key
element of state-of-the-art neural models -- attention maps in transformers.
Our working hypothesis is that reasoning steps leading to model predictions are
observable from attention distributions, which are particularly useful for
visualization. The design process of VisQA was motivated by well-known bias
examples from the fields of deep learning and vision-language reasoning and
evaluated in two ways. First, as a result of a collaboration of three fields,
machine learning, vision and language reasoning, and data analytics, the work
lead to a better understanding of bias exploitation of neural models for VQA,
which eventually resulted in an impact on its design and training through the
proposition of a method for the transfer of reasoning patterns from an oracle
model. Second, we also report on the design of VisQA, and a goal-oriented
evaluation of VisQA targeting the analysis of a model decision process from
multiple experts, providing evidence that it makes the inner workings of models
accessible to users.]]></summary>

challenging as various methods are continually being developed to generate
adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose an evolutionary approach to
automatically determine Image Processing Techniques Sequence (IPTS) for
detecting malicious inputs. Accordingly, we first used a diverse set of attack
methods including adaptive attack methods (on our defense) to generate
adversarial samples from the clean dataset. A detection framework based on a
genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to find the optimal IPTS, where the
optimality is estimated by different fitness measures such as Euclidean
distance, entropy loss, average histogram, local binary pattern and loss
functions. The "image difference" between the original and processed images is
used to extract the features, which are then fed to a classification scheme in
order to determine whether the input sample is adversarial or clean. This paper
described our methodology and performed experiments using multiple data-sets
tested with several adversarial attacks. For each attack-type and dataset, it
generates unique IPTS. A set of IPTS selected dynamically in testing time which
works as a filter for the adversarial attack. Our empirical experiments
exhibited promising results indicating the approach can efficiently be used as

challenges in deployment in application scenarios with limited memory and
computation capacity. Knowledge distillation is one approach to derive compact
models from bigger ones. However, it has been observed that a converged heavy
teacher model is strongly constrained for learning a compact student network
and could make the optimization subject to poor local optima. In this paper, we
propose ProKT, a new model-agnostic method by projecting the supervision
signals of a teacher model into the student's parameter space. Such projection
is implemented by decomposing the training objective into local intermediate
targets with an approximate mirror descent technique. The proposed method could
be less sensitive with the quirks during optimization which could result in a
better local optimum. Experiments on both image and text datasets show that our
proposed ProKT consistently achieves superior performance compared to other

decomposition, or robust principal component analysis (PCA), has achieved
stunning performance. However, the selection of the parameters of L+S is
empirical, and the acceleration rate is limited, which are common failings of
iterative compressed sensing MR imaging (CS-MRI) reconstruction methods. Many
deep learning approaches have been proposed to address these issues, but few of
them use a low-rank prior. In this paper, a model-based low-rank plus sparse
network, dubbed L+S-Net, is proposed for dynamic MR reconstruction. In
particular, we use an alternating linearized minimization method to solve the
optimization problem with low-rank and sparse regularization. Learned soft
singular value thresholding is introduced to ensure the clear separation of the
L component and S component. Then, the iterative steps are unrolled into a
network in which the regularization parameters are learnable. We prove that the
proposed L+S-Net achieves global convergence under two standard assumptions.
Experiments on retrospective and prospective cardiac cine datasets show that
the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art CS and existing deep learning
methods and has great potential for extremely high acceleration factors (up to
24x).]]></summary>

zero-shot transfer to a priori unknown test distributions. However, common
evaluation protocols only test a single, fixed data split in which train and
test classes are assigned randomly. More realistic evaluations should consider
a broad spectrum of distribution shifts with potentially varying degree and
difficulty. In this work, we systematically construct train-test splits of
increasing difficulty and present the ooDML benchmark to characterize
generalization under out-of-distribution shifts in DML. ooDML is designed to
probe the generalization performance on much more challenging, diverse
train-to-test distribution shifts. Based on our new benchmark, we conduct a
thorough empirical analysis of state-of-the-art DML methods. We find that while
generalization tends to consistently degrade with difficulty, some methods are
better at retaining performance as the distribution shift increases. Finally,
we propose few-shot DML as an efficient way to consistently improve
generalization in response to unknown test shifts presented in ooDML. Code

to cooperatively navigate across photo-realistic environments to reach target

Moreover, a memory-augmented communication framework is proposed. Each agent is
equipped with a private, external memory to persistently store communication

anchor-based detectors. While pruning techniques are widely used to reduce the
computational cost of convolutional neural networks, they tend to focus on

work we demonstrate an additional pruning technique, specifically for object
detection: anchor pruning. With more efficient backbone networks and a growing
trend of deploying object detectors on embedded systems where post-processing
steps such as non-maximum suppression can be a bottleneck, the impact of the
anchors used in the detection head is becoming increasingly more important. In
this work, we show that many anchors in the object detection head can be
removed without any loss in accuracy. With additional retraining, anchor
pruning can even lead to improved accuracy. Extensive experiments on SSD and MS
COCO show that the detection head can be made up to 44% more efficient while
simultaneously increasing accuracy. Further experiments on RetinaNet and PASCAL

`overanchorized' models that can be used together with anchor pruning to
eliminate hyperparameters related to the initial shape of anchors.]]></summary>

various applied fields. In computer graphics, special attention has been given
to the registration between two partial point clouds generated by scanning
devices. State-of-the-art registration techniques still struggle when the
overlap region between the two point clouds is small, and completely fail if
there is no overlap between the scan pairs. In this paper, we present a
learning-based technique that alleviates this problem, and allows registration
between point clouds, presented in arbitrary poses, and having little or even
no overlap, a setting that has been referred to as tele-registration. Our
technique is based on a novel neural network design that learns a prior of a
class of shapes and can complete a partial shape. The key idea is combining the
registration and completion tasks in a way that reinforces each other. In
particular, we simultaneously train the registration network and completion
network using two coupled flows, one that register-and-complete, and one that
complete-and-register, and encourage the two flows to produce a consistent
result. We show that, compared with each separate flow, this two-flow training
leads to robust and reliable tele-registration, and hence to a better point
cloud prediction that completes the registered scans. It is also worth
mentioning that each of the components in our neural network outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both completion and registration. We further
analyze our network with several ablation studies and demonstrate its
performance on a large number of partial point clouds, both synthetic and
real-world, that have only small or no overlap.]]></summary>

a wide range of human and machine perception tasks. For human perception tasks,
a distortion quantification can substitute subjective experiments to guide 3D
visualization; while for machine perception tasks, a distortion quantification
can work as a loss function to guide the training of deep neural networks for
unsupervised learning tasks. To handle a variety of demands in many
applications, a distortion quantification needs to be distortion discriminable,
differentiable, and have a low computational complexity. Currently, however,
there is a lack of a general distortion quantification that can satisfy all
three conditions. To fill this gap, this work proposes multiscale potential
energy discrepancy (MPED), a distortion quantification to measure point cloud
geometry and color difference. By evaluating at various neighborhood sizes, the
proposed MPED achieves global-local tradeoffs, capturing distortion in a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation aims to adapt
a segmentation model trained on the labeled source domain to the unlabeled
target domain. Existing methods try to learn domain invariant features while
suffering from large domain gaps that make it difficult to correctly align
discrepant features, especially in the initial training phase. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Dual Soft-Paste (DSP) method in this paper.
Specifically, DSP selects some classes from a source domain image using a
long-tail class first sampling strategy and softly pastes the corresponding
image patch on both the source and target training images with a fusion weight.
Technically, we adopt the mean teacher framework for domain adaptation, where
the pasted source and target images go through the student network while the
original target image goes through the teacher network. Output-level alignment
is carried out by aligning the probability maps of the target fused image from
both networks using a weighted cross-entropy loss. In addition, feature-level
alignment is carried out by aligning the feature maps of the source and target
images from student network using a weighted maximum mean discrepancy loss. DSP
facilitates the model learning domain-invariant features from the intermediate
domains, leading to faster convergence and better performance. Experiments on
two challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DSP over
state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

a single image with enhanced information. In recent years, state-of-the-art
methods have adopted Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to encode meaningful
features for image fusion. Specifically, CNN-based methods perform image fusion
by fusing local features. However, they do not consider long-range dependencies
that are present in the image. Transformer-based models are designed to
overcome this by modeling the long-range dependencies with the help of
self-attention mechanism. This motivates us to propose a novel Image Fusion
Transformer (IFT) where we develop a transformer-based multi-scale fusion
strategy that attends to both local and long-range information (or global
context). The proposed method follows a two-stage training approach. In the
first stage, we train an auto-encoder to extract deep features at multiple
scales. In the second stage, multi-scale features are fused using a
Spatio-Transformer (ST) fusion strategy. The ST fusion blocks are comprised of
a CNN and a transformer branch which capture local and long-range features,
respectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that
the proposed method performs better than many competitive fusion algorithms.
Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of the proposed ST fusion strategy with
an ablation analysis. The source code is available at:

lives and has affected all aspects of human life. This paper focuses on the
application of deep learning (DL) models to medical imaging and drug discovery
for managing COVID-19 disease. In this article, we detail various medical
imaging-based studies such as X-rays and computed tomography (CT) images along
with DL methods for classifying COVID-19 affected versus pneumonia. The
applications of DL techniques to medical images are further described in terms
of image localization, segmentation, registration, and classification leading
to COVID-19 detection. The reviews of recent papers indicate that the highest
classification accuracy of 99.80% is obtained when InstaCovNet-19 DL method is
applied to an X-ray dataset of 361 COVID-19 patients, 362 pneumonia patients
and 365 normal people. Furthermore, it can be seen that the best classification
accuracy of 99.054% can be achieved when EDL_COVID DL method is applied to a CT
image dataset of 7500 samples where COVID-19 patients, lung tumor patients and
normal people are equal in number. Moreover, we illustrate the potential DL

by utilizing transferable information learned from the available source domain
and a few labeled target data. However, source data is not always accessible in
practical scenarios, which restricts the application of SSDA in real world
circumstances. In this paper, we propose a novel task named Semi-supervised
Source Hypothesis Transfer (SSHT), which performs domain adaptation based on
source trained model, to generalize well in target domain with a few
supervisions. In SSHT, we are facing two challenges: (1) The insufficient
labeled target data may result in target features near the decision boundary,
with the increased risk of mis-classification; (2) The data are usually
imbalanced in source domain, so the model trained with these data is biased.
The biased model is prone to categorize samples of minority categories into
majority ones, resulting in low prediction diversity. To tackle the above
issues, we propose Consistency and Diversity Learning (CDL), a simple but
effective framework for SSHT by facilitating prediction consistency between two
randomly augmented unlabeled data and maintaining the prediction diversity when
adapting model to target domain. Encouraging consistency regularization brings
difficulty to memorize the few labeled target data and thus enhances the
generalization ability of the learned model. We further integrate Batch
Nuclear-norm Maximization into our method to enhance the discriminability and
diversity. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing SSDA
methods and unsupervised model adaptation methods on DomainNet, Office-Home and
Office-31 datasets. The code is available at

publicly available and fully-annotated datasets usually do not well-represent
the heterogeneous modalities, phases, pathologies, and clinical scenarios
encountered in real environments. On the other hand, there are tremendous
amounts of unlabelled patient imaging scans stored by many modern clinical
centers. In this work, we present a novel segmentation strategy,
co-heterogenous and adaptive segmentation (CHASe), which only requires a small
labeled cohort of single phase imaging data to adapt to any unlabeled cohort of
heterogenous multi-phase data with possibly new clinical scenarios and
pathologies. To do this, we propose a versatile framework that fuses appearance
based semi-supervision, mask based adversarial domain adaptation, and
pseudo-labeling. We also introduce co-heterogeneous training, which is a novel
integration of co-training and hetero modality learning. We have evaluated
CHASe using a clinically comprehensive and challenging dataset of multi-phase
computed tomography (CT) imaging studies (1147 patients and 4577 3D volumes).
Compared to previous state-of-the-art baselines, CHASe can further improve
pathological liver mask Dice-Sorensen coefficients by ranges of $4.2\% \sim
9.4\%$, depending on the phase combinations: e.g., from $84.6\%$ to $94.0\%$ on

has achieved great success in learning visual representations without data
annotations. However, most of methods mainly focus on the instance level
information (\ie, the different augmented images of the same instance should
have the same feature or cluster into the same class), but there is a lack of
attention on the relationships between different instances. In this paper, we
introduced a novel SSL paradigm, which we term as relational self-supervised
learning (ReSSL) framework that learns representations by modeling the
relationship between different instances. Specifically, our proposed method
employs sharpened distribution of pairwise similarities among different
instances as \textit{relation} metric, which is thus utilized to match the
feature embeddings of different augmentations. Moreover, to boost the
performance, we argue that weak augmentations matter to represent a more
reliable relation, and leverage momentum strategy for practical efficiency.
Experimental results show that our proposed ReSSL significantly outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both performance and training
efficiency. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/KyleZheng1997/ReSSL}.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few-shot learning aims at rapidly adapting to novel categories with only a
handful of samples at test time, which has been predominantly tackled with the
idea of meta-learning. However, meta-learning approaches essentially learn
across a variety of few-shot tasks and thus still require large-scale training
data with fine-grained supervision to derive a generalized model, thereby
involving prohibitive annotation cost. In this paper, we advance the few-shot
classification paradigm towards a more challenging scenario, i.e.,
cross-granularity few-shot classification, where the model observes only coarse
labels during training while is expected to perform fine-grained classification
during testing. This task largely relieves the annotation cost since
fine-grained labeling usually requires strong domain-specific expertise. To
bridge the cross-granularity gap, we approximate the fine-grained data
distribution by greedy clustering of each coarse-class into pseudo-fine-classes
according to the similarity of image embeddings. We then propose a
meta-embedder that jointly optimizes the visual- and semantic-discrimination,
in both instance-wise and coarse class-wise, to obtain a good feature space for
this coarse-to-fine pseudo-labeling process. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our
approach on three representative datasets.]]></summary>

understand tables. Its main task is to recognize the internal structure of a
table. However, due to the complexity and diversity in their structure and
style, it is very difficult to parse the tabular data into the structured
format which machines can understand easily, especially for complex tables. In
this paper, we introduce Split, Embed and Merge (SEM), an accurate table
structure recognizer. Our model takes table images as input and can correctly
recognize the structure of tables, whether they are simple or a complex tables.
SEM is mainly composed of three parts, splitter, embedder and merger. In the
first stage, we apply the splitter to predict the potential regions of the
table row (column) separators, and obtain the fine grid structure of the table.
In the second stage, by taking a full consideration of the textual information
in the table, we fuse the output features for each table grid from both vision
and language modalities. Moreover, we achieve a higher precision in our
experiments through adding additional semantic features. Finally, we process
the merging of these basic table grids in a self-regression manner. The
correspondent merging results is learned through the attention mechanism. In
our experiments, SEM achieves an average F1-Measure of 97.11% on the SciTSR
dataset which outperforms other methods by a large margin. We also won the
first place in the complex table and third place in all tables in ICDAR 2021
Competition on Scientific Literature Parsing, Task-B. Extensive experiments on
other publicly available datasets demonstrate that our model achieves

led to an outburst in the amount of data stored digitally. Consequently,
several retrieval systems have been developed depending on the type of data
stored in these databases. However, unlike text data or images, performing a
search for 3D models is non-trivial. Among 3D models, retrieving 3D
Engineering/CAD models or mechanical components is even more challenging due to
the presence of holes, volumetric features, presence of sharp edges etc., which
make CAD a domain unto itself. The research work presented in this paper aims
at developing a dataset suitable for building a retrieval system for 3D CAD
models based on deep learning. 3D CAD models from the available CAD databases
are collected, and a dataset of computer-generated sketch data, termed
'CADSketchNet', has been prepared. Additionally, hand-drawn sketches of the
components are also added to CADSketchNet. Using the sketch images from this
dataset, the paper also aims at evaluating the performance of various retrieval
system or a search engine for 3D CAD models that accepts a sketch image as the
input query. Many experimental models are constructed and tested on
CADSketchNet. These experiments, along with the model architecture, choice of
similarity metrics are reported along with the search results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purpose: To evaluate a fully-automated deep-learning-based method for
assessment of intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC). Methods: Two
observers manually delineated ICAC in non-contrast CT scans of 2,319
participants (mean age 69 (SD 7) years; 1154 women) of the Rotterdam Study,
prospectively collected between 2003 and 2006. These data were used to
retrospectively develop and validate a deep-learning-based method for automated
ICAC delineation and volume measurement. To evaluate the method, we compared
manual and automatic assessment (computed using ten-fold cross-validation) with
respect to 1) the agreement with an independent observer's assessment
(available in a random subset of 47 scans); 2) the accuracy in delineating ICAC
as judged via blinded visual comparison by an expert; 3) the association with
first stroke incidence from the scan date until 2012. All method performance
metrics were computed using 10-fold cross-validation. Results: The automated
delineation of ICAC reached sensitivity of 83.8% and positive predictive value
(PPV) of 88%. The intraclass correlation between automatic and manual ICAC
volume measures was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.97, 0.98; computed in the entire dataset).
Measured between the assessments of independent observers, sensitivity was
73.9%, PPV was 89.5%, and intraclass correlation was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.95;
computed in the 47-scan subset). In the blinded visual comparisons, automatic
delineations were more accurate than manual ones (p-value = 0.01). The
association of ICAC volume with incident stroke was similarly strong for both
automated (hazard ratio, 1.38 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.75) and manually measured
volumes (hazard ratio, 1.48 (95% CI: 1.20, 1.87)). Conclusions: The developed
model was capable of automated segmentation and volume quantification of ICAC
with accuracy comparable to human experts.]]></summary>

learning-based detection methods have achieved very promising results. In
general, these methods require exhaustively annotating the cells in an entire
image. If some of the cells are not annotated (imperfect annotation), the
detection performance significantly degrades due to noisy labels. This often
occurs in real collaborations with biologists and even in public data-sets. Our
proposed method takes a pseudo labeling approach for cell detection from
imperfect annotated data. A detection convolutional neural network (CNN)
trained using such missing labeled data often produces over-detection. We treat
partially labeled cells as positive samples and the detected positions except
for the labeled cell as unlabeled samples. Then we select reliable pseudo
labels from unlabeled data using recent machine learning techniques;
positive-and-unlabeled (PU) learning and P-classification. Experiments using

across the web, especially on social media websites used by half the world's
population. In this context, Face Recognition (FR) systems have the potential
to match faces to specific names and identities, creating glaring privacy
concerns. Adversarial attacks are a promising way to grant users privacy from
FR systems by disrupting their capability to recognize faces. Yet, such attacks
can be perceptible to human observers, especially under the more challenging
black-box threat model. In the literature, the justification for the
imperceptibility of such attacks hinges on bounding metrics such as $\ell_p$
norms. However, there is not much research on how these norms match up with
human perception. Through examining and measuring both the effectiveness of
recent black-box attacks in the face recognition setting and their
corresponding human perceptibility through survey data, we demonstrate the
trade-offs in perceptibility that occur as attacks become more aggressive. We
also show how the $\ell_2$ norm and other metrics do not correlate with human
perceptibility in a linear fashion, thus making these norms suboptimal at
measuring adversarial attack perceptibility.]]></summary>

suffering from the difficulty of the convergence of train-ing a GAN, the

this work, we find that the discriminatorcould be not necessary for

Auto-Encoder (SSAE)to generate the perturbations, which is composed of the
saliencymap module and the angle-norm disentanglement of the featuresmodule.
The advantage of our proposed method lies in that it is notdepending on

label-relevant regions. The extensive exper-iments among the various tasks,

ZstGAN: By introducing an adversarial training scheme, ZstGAN learns to model
each domain with domain-specific feature distribution that is semantically
consistent on vision and attribute modalities. Then the domain-invariant
features are disentangled with an shared encoder for image generation. We carry
out extensive experiments on CUB and FLO datasets, and the results demonstrate

prediction method by minimizing the fitting loss of the uncertain point.
Finally, we find out whether the bouncing point of the ball is out of bounds or

generators have alleviated the lack of annotated text images from the real
world. Specifically, they generate multiple text images with diverse
backgrounds, font styles, and text shapes and enable STR models to learn visual
patterns that might not be accessible from manually annotated data. In this
paper, we introduce a new synthetic text image generator, SynthTIGER, by
analyzing techniques used for text image synthesis and integrating effective
ones under a single algorithm. Moreover, we propose two techniques that
alleviate the long-tail problem in length and character distributions of
training data. In our experiments, SynthTIGER achieves better STR performance
than the combination of synthetic datasets, MJSynth (MJ) and SynthText (ST).
Our ablation study demonstrates the benefits of using sub-components of
SynthTIGER and the guideline on generating synthetic text images for STR
models. Our implementation is publicly available at

models from long-tailed data, generally assume the models would be evaluated on
the uniform test class distribution. However, the practical test class
distribution often violates such an assumption (e.g., being long-tailed or even
inversely long-tailed), which would lead existing methods to fail in real-world
applications. In this work, we study a more practical task setting, called
test-agnostic long-tailed recognition, where the training class distribution is
long-tailed while the test class distribution is unknown and can be skewed
arbitrarily. In addition to the issue of class imbalance, this task poses
another challenge: the class distribution shift between the training and test
samples is unidentified. To address this task, we propose a new method, called
Test-time Aggregating Diverse Experts (TADE), that presents two solution
strategies: (1) a novel skill-diverse expert learning strategy that trains
diverse experts to excel at handling different test distributions from a single
long-tailed training distribution; (2) a novel test-time expert aggregation
strategy that leverages self-supervision to aggregate multiple experts for
handling various test distributions. Moreover, we theoretically show that our
method has provable ability to simulate unknown test class distributions.
Promising results on both vanilla and test-agnostic long-tailed recognition
verify the effectiveness of TADE. Code is available at

recover realistic details for single image super-resolution (SISR). To further
improve the visual quality of super-resolved results, PIRM2018-SR Challenge
employed perceptual metrics to assess the perceptual quality, such as PI, NIQE,

Generative Adversarial Networks with Ranker (RankSRGAN) to optimize generator
in the direction of different perceptual metrics. Specifically, we first train
a Ranker which can learn the behaviour of perceptual metrics and then introduce
a novel rank-content loss to optimize the perceptual quality. The most
appealing part is that the proposed method can combine the strengths of
different SR methods to generate better results. Furthermore, we extend our
method to multiple Rankers to provide multi-dimension constraints for the

deep-learning-based global building change surveillance. In particular, the
scroll imaging mode of optical satellites enables larger observation ranges and
shorter revisit periods, facilitating efficient global surveillance. However,
the images in recent satellite change detection datasets are mainly captured at
near-nadir viewing angles. In this paper, we introduce S2Looking, a building
change detection dataset that contains large-scale side-looking satellite
images captured at varying off-nadir angles. Our S2Looking dataset consists of
5000 registered bitemporal image pairs (size of 1024*1024, 0.5 ~ 0.8 m/pixel)
of rural areas throughout the world and more than 65,920 annotated change
instances. We provide two label maps to separately indicate the newly built and
demolished building regions for each sample in the dataset. We establish a
benchmark task based on this dataset, i.e., identifying the pixel-level
building changes in the bi-temporal images. We test several state-of-the-art
methods on both the S2Looking dataset and the (near-nadir) LEVIR-CD+ dataset.
The experimental results show that recent change detection methods exhibit much
poorer performance on the S2Looking than on LEVIR-CD+. The proposed S2Looking
dataset presents three main challenges: 1) large viewing angle changes, 2)
large illumination variances and 3) various complex scene characteristics
encountered in rural areas. Our proposed dataset may promote the development of
algorithms for satellite image change detection and registration under
conditions of large off-nadir angles. The dataset is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Face recognition remains a challenging task in unconstrained scenarios,
especially when faces are partially occluded. To improve the robustness against
occlusion, augmenting the training images with artificial occlusions has been
proved as a useful approach. However, these artificial occlusions are commonly
generated by adding a black rectangle or several object templates including
sunglasses, scarfs and phones, which cannot well simulate the realistic
occlusions. In this paper, based on the argument that the occlusion essentially
damages a group of neurons, we propose a novel and elegant occlusion-simulation
method via dropping the activations of a group of neurons in some elaborately
selected channel. Specifically, we first employ a spatial regularization to
encourage each feature channel to respond to local and different face regions.
In this way, the activations affected by an occlusion in a local region are
more likely to be located in a single feature channel. Then, the locality-aware
channel-wise dropout (LCD) is designed to simulate the occlusion by dropping
out the entire feature channel. Furthermore, by randomly dropping out several
feature channels, our method can well simulate the occlusion of larger area.
The proposed LCD can encourage its succeeding layers to minimize the
intra-class feature variance caused by occlusions, thus leading to improved
robustness against occlusion. In addition, we design an auxiliary spatial
attention module by learning a channel-wise attention vector to reweight the
feature channels, which improves the contributions of non-occluded regions.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks show that the proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a remarkable improvement.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Automotive Cyber-Physical Systems (ACPS) have attracted a significant amount
of interest in the past few decades, while one of the most critical operations
in these systems is the perception of the environment. Deep learning and,
especially, the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) provides impressive results
in analyzing and understanding complex and dynamic scenes from visual data. The
prediction horizons for those perception systems are very short and inference
must often be performed in real time, stressing the need of transforming the
original large pre-trained networks into new smaller models, by utilizing Model
Compression and Acceleration (MCA) techniques. Our goal in this work is to
investigate best practices for appropriately applying novel weight sharing
techniques, optimizing the available variables and the training procedures
towards the significant acceleration of widely adopted DNNs. Extensive
evaluation studies carried out using various state-of-the-art DNN models in
object detection and tracking experiments, provide details about the type of
errors that manifest after the application of weight sharing techniques,
resulting in significant acceleration gains with negligible accuracy losses.]]></summary>

neural networks (CNNs) have difficulties generalising to unseen target domains.
When applied to segmentation of brain MRI scans, CNNs are highly sensitive to
changes in resolution and contrast: even within the same MR modality, decreases
in performance can be observed across datasets. We introduce SynthSeg, the
first segmentation CNN agnostic to brain MRI scans of any contrast and
resolution. SynthSeg is trained with synthetic data sampled from a generative
model inspired by Bayesian segmentation. Crucially, we adopt a \textit{domain
randomisation} strategy where we fully randomise the generation parameters to
maximise the variability of the training data. Consequently, SynthSeg can
segment preprocessed and unpreprocessed real scans of any target domain,
without retraining or fine-tuning. Because SynthSeg only requires segmentations
to be trained (no images), it can learn from label maps obtained automatically
from existing datasets of different populations (e.g., with atrophy and
lesions), thus achieving robustness to a wide range of morphological
variability. We demonstrate SynthSeg on 5,500 scans of 6 modalities and 10
resolutions, where it exhibits unparalleled generalisation compared to
supervised CNNs, test time adaptation, and Bayesian segmentation. The code and
trained model are available at https://github.com/BBillot/SynthSeg.]]></summary>

across all industries, such as disease diagnosis in healthcare or quality
assurance in manufacturing. Manual inspection of images, when extended over a
monotonously repetitive period of time is very time consuming and can lead to
anomalies being overlooked.Artificial neural networks have proven themselves
very successful on simple, repetitive tasks, in some cases even outperforming
humans. Therefore, in this paper we investigate different methods of deep
learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, for anomaly detection
applied to a quality assurance use case. We utilize the MVTec anomaly dataset
and develop three different models, a CNN for supervised anomaly detection,
KD-CAE for autoencoder anomaly detection, NI-CAE for noise induced anomaly
detection and a DCGAN for generating reconstructed images. By experiments, we
found that KD-CAE performs better on the anomaly datasets compared to CNN and
NI-CAE, with NI-CAE performing the best on the Transistor dataset. We also
implemented a DCGAN for the creation of new training data but due to
computational limitation and lack of extrapolating the mechanics of AnoGAN, we
restricted ourselves just to the generation of GAN based images. We conclude
that unsupervised methods are more powerful for anomaly detection in images,
especially in a setting where only a small amount of anomalous data is
available, or the data is unlabeled.]]></summary>

for the development of reliable intelligent agents, such as self-driving cars
or robot assistants. While the ability to make future predictions with high
accuracy is crucial for designing the anticipation approaches, the speed at
which the inference is performed is not less important. Methods that are
accurate but not sufficiently fast would introduce a high latency into the
decision process. Thus, this will increase the reaction time of the underlying
system. This poses a problem for domains such as autonomous driving, where the
reaction time is crucial. In this work, we propose a simple and effective
multi-modal architecture based on temporal convolutions. Our approach stacks a
hierarchy of temporal convolutional layers and does not rely on recurrent
layers to ensure a fast prediction. We further introduce a multi-modal fusion
mechanism that captures the pairwise interactions between RGB, flow, and object
modalities. Results on two large-scale datasets of egocentric videos,
EPIC-Kitchens-55 and EPIC-Kitchens-100, show that our approach achieves
comparable performance to the state-of-the-art approaches while being

talking-head videos from a single reference image. In this work, we tackle two
key challenges: (i) producing natural head motions that match speech prosody,
and (ii) maintaining the appearance of a speaker in a large head motion while
stabilizing the non-face regions. We first design a head pose predictor by
modeling rigid 6D head movements with a motion-aware recurrent neural network
(RNN). In this way, the predicted head poses act as the low-frequency holistic
movements of a talking head, thus allowing our latter network to focus on
detailed facial movement generation. To depict the entire image motions arising
from audio, we exploit a keypoint based dense motion field representation.
Then, we develop a motion field generator to produce the dense motion fields
from input audio, head poses, and a reference image. As this keypoint based
representation models the motions of facial regions, head, and backgrounds
integrally, our method can better constrain the spatial and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. Finally, an image generation network is
employed to render photo-realistic talking-head videos from the estimated
keypoint based motion fields and the input reference image. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method produces videos with plausible head
motions, synchronized facial expressions, and stable backgrounds and
outperforms the state-of-the-art.]]></summary>

for learning latent fine-grained structure in the embedding space. Furthermore,
to overcome the drawbacks of random image transformation used in current
contrastive learning in producing noisy and inaccurate image pairs (i.e.,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Near infrared (NIR) imaging has been widely applied in low-light imaging
scenarios; however, it is difficult for human and algorithms to perceive the
real scene in the colorless NIR domain. While Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) has been widely employed in various image colorization tasks, it is
challenging for a direct mapping mechanism, such as a conventional GAN, to
transform an image from the NIR to the RGB domain with correct semantic
reasoning, well-preserved textures, and vivid color combinations concurrently.
In this work, we propose a novel Attention-based NIR image colorization
framework via Adaptive Fusion of Semantic and Texture clues, aiming at
achieving these goals within the same framework. The tasks of texture transfer
and semantic reasoning are carried out in two separate network blocks.
Specifically, the Texture Transfer Block (TTB) aims at extracting texture
features from the NIR image's Laplacian component and transferring them for
subsequent color fusion. The Semantic Reasoning Block (SRB) extracts semantic
clues and maps the NIR pixel values to the RGB domain. Finally, a Fusion
Attention Block (FAB) is proposed to adaptively fuse the features from the two
branches and generate an optimized colorization result. In order to enhance the
network's learning capacity in semantic reasoning as well as mapping precision
in texture transfer, we have proposed the Residual Coordinate Attention Block
(RCAB), which incorporates coordinate attention into a residual learning
framework, enabling the network to capture long-range dependencies along the
channel direction and meanwhile precise positional information can be preserved
along spatial directions. RCAB is also incorporated into FAB to facilitate
accurate texture alignment during fusion. Both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art NIR
image colorization methods.]]></summary>

generalized SLU in commercial voice assistants (VAs). We propose a fully
differentiable, transformer-based, hierarchical system that can be pretrained
at both the ASR and NLU levels. This is then fine-tuned on both transcription

argument combinations. This leads to an SLU system that achieves significant
improvements over baselines on a complex internal generalized VA dataset with a
43% improvement in accuracy, while still meeting the 99% accuracy benchmark on
the popular Fluent Speech Commands dataset. We further evaluate our model on a

convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Although CNNs offer promising
perspectives for 2D image compression, extending such models to omnidirectional
images is not straightforward. First, omnidirectional images have specific
spatial and statistical properties that can not be fully captured by current
CNN models. Second, basic mathematical operations composing a CNN architecture,
e.g., translation and sampling, are not well-defined on the sphere. In this
paper, we study the learning of representation models for omnidirectional
images and propose to use the properties of HEALPix uniform sampling of the
sphere to redefine the mathematical tools used in deep learning models for
omnidirectional images. In particular, we: i) propose the definition of a new
convolution operation on the sphere that keeps the high expressiveness and the
low complexity of a classical 2D convolution; ii) adapt standard CNN techniques
such as stride, iterative aggregation, and pixel shuffling to the spherical
domain; and then iii) apply our new framework to the task of omnidirectional
image compression. Our experiments show that our proposed on-the-sphere
solution leads to a better compression gain that can save 13.7% of the bit rate
compared to similar learned models applied to equirectangular images. Also,
compared to learning models based on graph convolutional networks, our solution
supports more expressive filters that can preserve high frequencies and provide
a better perceptual quality of the compressed images. Such results demonstrate
the efficiency of the proposed framework, which opens new research venues for
other omnidirectional vision tasks to be effectively implemented on the sphere
manifold.]]></summary>

mentioned in the question, such as objects and people. VQA methods should be
able to compose skills and concepts in novel ways, regardless of whether the
specific composition has been seen in training, yet we demonstrate that
existing models have much to improve upon towards handling new compositions. We
present a novel method for learning to compose skills and concepts that
separates these two factors implicitly within a model by learning grounded
concept representations and disentangling the encoding of skills from that of
concepts. We enforce these properties with a novel contrastive learning

Resonance (MR) image acquisition can cause image artifacts. Motion correction
techniques have been proposed to compensate for these types of motion during
thoracic scans, relying on accurate motion estimation from undersampled
motion-resolved reconstruction. A particular interest and challenge lie in the
derivation of reliable non-rigid motion fields from the undersampled
motion-resolved data. Motion estimation is usually formulated in image space
via diffusion, parametric-spline, or optical flow methods. However, image-based
registration can be impaired by remaining aliasing artifacts due to the
undersampled motion-resolved reconstruction. In this work, we describe a
formalism to perform non-rigid registration directly in the sampled Fourier
space, i.e. k-space. We propose a deep-learning based approach to perform fast
and accurate non-rigid registration from the undersampled k-space data. The
basic working principle originates from the Local All-Pass (LAP) technique, a
recently introduced optical flow-based registration. The proposed LAPNet is
compared against traditional and deep learning image-based registrations and
tested on fully-sampled and highly-accelerated (with two undersampling
strategies) 3D respiratory motion-resolved MR images in a cohort of 40 patients
with suspected liver or lung metastases and 25 healthy subjects. The proposed
LAPNet provided consistent and superior performance to image-based approaches
throughout different sampling trajectories and acceleration factors.]]></summary>

imaging due to their promising pattern recognition capabilities. However, Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs) require a huge amount of data, and because of the lack

DNNs used for disease diagnosis meticulously concentrate on improving the
accuracy of predictions without providing a figure about their confidence of
predictions. Knowing how much a DNN model is confident in a computer-aided
diagnosis model is necessary for gaining clinicians' confidence and trust in
DL-based solutions. To address this issue, this work presents three different
methods for quantifying uncertainties for skin cancer detection from images. It
also comprehensively evaluates and compares performance of these DNNs using
novel uncertainty-related metrics. The obtained results reveal that the
predictive uncertainty estimation methods are capable of flagging risky and
erroneous predictions with a high uncertainty estimate. We also demonstrate
that ensemble approaches are more reliable in capturing uncertainties through

long-standing challenge of Earth observation, particularly across different
modalities such as optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Here, we
explore the joint analysis of imagery from different sensors in the light of
representation learning: we propose to learn a joint, sensor-invariant
embedding (feature representation) within a deep neural network. Our
application problem is the monitoring of lake ice on Alpine lakes. To reach the
temporal resolution requirement of the Swiss Global Climate Observing System
(GCOS) office, we combine three image sources: Sentinel-1 SAR (S1-SAR), Terra
MODIS and Suomi-NPP VIIRS. The large gaps between the optical and SAR domains
and between the sensor resolutions make this a challenging instance of the
sensor fusion problem. Our approach can be classified as a feature-level fusion
that is learnt in a data-driven manner. The proposed network architecture has
separate encoding branches for each image sensor, which feed into a single
latent embedding. I.e., a common feature representation shared by all inputs,
such that subsequent processing steps deliver comparable output irrespective of
which sort of input image was used. By fusing satellite data, we map lake ice
at a temporal resolution of <1.5 days. The network produces spatially explicit
lake ice maps with pixel-wise accuracies >91.3% (respectively, mIoU scores
>60.7%) and generalises well across different lakes and winters. Moreover, it
sets a new state-of-the-art for determining the important ice-on and ice-off

depending on specific situations. Indeed, the way in which words are
instantiated and associated represents a particularly interesting aspect that
can substantially help to better understand the context in which they are

concepts that are currently related to some of the main standing challenges in
science. More specifically, the study reported here takes into account the
words "prediction", "model", "optimization", "complex", "entropy", "random",
"deterministic", "pattern", and "database". In order to complement the

of the words were observed to have markedly distinct associations in different

two novel sub-tasks of this problem, and provide a corresponding dialogue-level
dataset, along with strong Transformer-based baselines. The dataset is
available at https://github.com/declare-lab/RECCON.

Introduction: Recognizing the cause behind emotions in text is a fundamental
yet under-explored area of research in NLP. Advances in this area hold the
potential to improve interpretability and performance in affect-based models.
Identifying emotion causes at the utterance level in conversations is
particularly challenging due to the intermingling dynamics among the
interlocutors.

Method: We introduce the task of Recognizing Emotion Cause in CONversations
with an accompanying dataset named \RECCONDA, containing over 1,000 dialogues
and 10,000 utterance cause-effect pairs. Furthermore, we define different cause
types based on the source of the causes, and establish strong Transformer-based
baselines to address two different sub-tasks on this dataset: causal span
extraction and causal emotion entailment.

Result: Our Transformer-based baselines, which leverage contextual
pre-trained embeddings, such as RoBERTa, outperform the state-of-the-art
emotion cause extraction approaches

Conclusion: We introduce a new task highly relevant for (explainable)
emotion-aware artificial intelligence: recognizing emotion cause in
conversations, provide a new highly challenging publicly available
dialogue-level dataset for this task, and give strong baseline results on this
dataset.]]></summary>

a platform for people to express their opinions on various topics. A wide
variety of views accompanies COVID-19 vaccination drives across the globe,
often colored by emotions, which change along with rising cases, approval of
vaccines, and multiple factors discussed online. This study aims at analyzing
the temporal evolution of different Emotion categories: Hesitation, Rage,
Sorrow, Anticipation, Faith, and Contentment with Influencing Factors: Vaccine
Rollout, Misinformation, Health Effects, and Inequities as lexical categories
created from Tweets belonging to five countries with vital vaccine roll-out
programs, namely, India, United States of America, Brazil, United Kingdom, and
Australia. We extracted a corpus of nearly 1.8 million Twitter posts related to
COVID-19 vaccination. Using cosine distance from selected seed words, we
expanded the vocabulary of each category and tracked the longitudinal change in
their strength from June 2020 to April 2021. We used community detection
algorithms to find modules in positive correlation networks. Our findings
suggest that tweets expressing hesitancy towards vaccines contain the highest
mentions of health-related effects in all countries. Our results indicated that
the patterns of hesitancy were variable across geographies and can help us
learn targeted interventions. We also observed a significant change in the
linear trends of categories like hesitation and contentment before and after
approval of vaccines. Negative emotions like rage and sorrow gained the highest
importance in the alluvial diagram. They formed a significant module with all
the influencing factors in April 2021, when India observed the second wave of
COVID-19 cases. The relationship between Emotions and Influencing Factors was
found to be variable across the countries.]]></summary>

options. It is well-known that, when sufficiently young children encounter a
new word, they tend to interpret it as pointing to a meaning that does not have
a word yet in their lexicon rather than to a meaning that already has a word
attached. In previous research, the strategy was shown to be optimal from an
information theoretic standpoint. In that framework, interpretation is
hypothesized to be driven by the minimization of a cost function: the option of
least communication cost is chosen. However, the information theoretic model
employed in that research neither explains the weakening of that vocabulary
learning bias in older children or polylinguals nor reproduces Zipf's
meaning-frequency law, namely the non-linear relationship between the number of
meanings of a word and its frequency. Here we consider a generalization of the
model that is channeled to reproduce that law. The analysis of the new model
reveals regions of the phase space where the bias disappears consistently with
the weakening or loss of the bias in older children or polylinguals. The model
is abstract enough to support future research on other levels of life that are
relevant to biosemiotics. In the deep learning era, the model is a transparent
low-dimensional tool for future experimental research and illustrates the
predictive power of a theoretical framework originally designed to shed light
on the origins of Zipf's rank-frequency law.]]></summary>

networks. In this paper, we propose a fully hyperbolic framework to build
hyperbolic networks based on the Lorentz model by adapting the Lorentz
transformations (including boost and rotation) to formalize essential
operations of neural networks. Moreover, we also prove that linear
transformation in tangent spaces used by existing hyperbolic networks is a
relaxation of the Lorentz rotation and does not include the boost, implicitly

primary clinical advice and diagnoses. It has been gradually adopted and
practiced in medical organizations in the form of a conversational bot, largely
due to the advancement of NLP. In recent years, the introduction of
state-of-the-art deep learning models and transfer learning techniques like
Universal Language Model Fine Tuning (ULMFiT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD)
largely contributes to the performance of NLP tasks. However, some deep neural
networks are poorly calibrated and wrongly estimate the uncertainty. Hence the
model is not trustworthy, especially in sensitive medical decision-making
systems and safety tasks. In this paper, we investigate the well-calibrated
model for ULMFiT and self-distillation (SD) in a medical dialogue system. The
calibrated ULMFiT (CULMFiT) is obtained by incorporating label smoothing (LS),
a commonly used regularization technique to achieve a well-calibrated model.
Moreover, we apply the technique to recalibrate the confidence score called
temperature scaling (TS) with KD to observe its correlation with network
calibration. To further understand the relation between SD and calibration, we
use both fixed and optimal temperatures to fine-tune the whole model. All
experiments are conducted on the consultation backpain dataset collected by
experts then further validated using a large publicly medial dialogue corpus.
We empirically show that our proposed methodologies outperform conventional
methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.]]></summary>

study of different configurations. A single-language system with an appropriate
programming model and compiler that targets both platforms simplifies this
exploration to a simple recompile with new compiler directives.

This work introduces StreamBlocks, an open-source compiler and runtime that
uses the CAL dataflow programming language to partition computations across
heterogeneous (CPU/accelerator) platforms. Because of the dataflow model's
semantics and the CAL language, StreamBlocks can exploit both thread
parallelism in multi-core CPUs and the inherent parallelism of FPGAs.
StreamBlocks supports exploring the design space with a profile-guided tool
that helps identify the best hardware-software partitions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detecting customized moments and highlights from videos given natural
language (NL) user queries is an important but under-studied topic. One of the
challenges in pursuing this direction is the lack of annotated data. To address
this issue, we present the Query-based Video Highlights (QVHighlights) dataset.
It consists of over 10,000 YouTube videos, covering a wide range of topics,
from everyday activities and travel in lifestyle vlog videos to social and
political activities in news videos. Each video in the dataset is annotated
with: (1) a human-written free-form NL query, (2) relevant moments in the video
w.r.t. the query, and (3) five-point scale saliency scores for all
query-relevant clips. This comprehensive annotation enables us to develop and
evaluate systems that detect relevant moments as well as salient highlights for
diverse, flexible user queries. We also present a strong baseline for this
task, Moment-DETR, a transformer encoder-decoder model that views moment
retrieval as a direct set prediction problem, taking extracted video and query
representations as inputs and predicting moment coordinates and saliency scores
end-to-end. While our model does not utilize any human prior, we show that it
performs competitively when compared to well-engineered architectures. With
weakly supervised pretraining using ASR captions, Moment-DETR substantially
outperforms previous methods. Lastly, we present several ablations and
visualizations of Moment-DETR. Data and code is publicly available at

processing, most approaches only target flat entities, ignoring nested
structures which are common in many scenarios. Most existing nested NER methods
traverse all sub-sequences which is both expensive and inefficient, and also
don't well consider boundary knowledge which is significant for nested
entities. In this paper, we propose a joint entity mention detection and typing
model via prior boundary knowledge (BoningKnife) to better handle nested NER
extraction and recognition tasks. BoningKnife consists of two modules,
MentionTagger and TypeClassifier. MentionTagger better leverages boundary
knowledge beyond just entity start/end to improve the handling of nesting
levels and longer spans, while generating high quality mention candidates.
TypeClassifier utilizes a two-level attention mechanism to decouple different
nested level representations and better distinguish entity types. We jointly
train both modules sharing a common representation and a new dual-info
attention layer, which leads to improved representation focus on entity-related
information. Experiments over different datasets show that our approach
outperforms previous state of the art methods and achieves 86.41, 85.46, and
94.2 F1 scores on ACE2004, ACE2005, and NNE, respectively.]]></summary>

ASR+TTS, overlooks the modeling of prosody, which plays an important role in
speech naturalness and conversion similarity. Although some researchers have
considered transferring prosodic clues from the source speech, there arises a
speaker mismatch during training and conversion. To address this issue, in this
work, we propose to directly predict prosody from the linguistic representation

Our new dataset WikiGraphs is collected by pairing each Wikipedia article from

from the Freebase knowledge graph (Bollacker et al., 2008). This makes it easy
to benchmark against other state-of-the-art text generative models that are
capable of generating long paragraphs of coherent text. Both the graphs and the
text data are of significantly larger scale compared to prior graph-text paired

videos from a multi-antenna base station (BS) to one or multiple single-antenna
users, respectively, in a multi-carrier wireless system. We aim to maximize the
video quality while keeping rebuffering time small via encoding rate adaptation
at each group of pictures (GOP) and transmission adaptation at each
(transmission) slot. To capture the impact of field-of-view (FoV) prediction,
we consider three cases of FoV viewing probability distributions, i.e.,
perfect, imperfect, and unknown FoV viewing probability distributions, and use
the average total utility, worst average total utility, and worst total utility
as the respective performance metrics. In the single-user scenario, we optimize
the encoding rates of the tiles, encoding rates of the FoVs, and transmission
beamforming vectors for all subcarriers to maximize the total utility in each
case. In the multi-user scenario, we adopt rate splitting with successive
decoding and optimize the encoding rates of the tiles, encoding rates of the
FoVs, rates of the common and private messages, and transmission beamforming
vectors for all subcarriers to maximize the total utility in each case. Then,
we separate the challenging optimization problem into multiple tractable
problems in each scenario. In the single-user scenario, we obtain a globally
optimal solution of each problem using transformation techniques and the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. In the multi-user scenario, we obtain a
KKT point of each problem using the concave-convex procedure (CCCP). Finally,
numerical results demonstrate that the proposed solutions achieve notable gains
over existing schemes in all three cases. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work revealing the impact of FoV prediction on the performance of
adaptive streaming of tiled 360 videos.]]></summary>

talking-head videos from a single reference image. In this work, we tackle two
key challenges: (i) producing natural head motions that match speech prosody,
and (ii) maintaining the appearance of a speaker in a large head motion while
stabilizing the non-face regions. We first design a head pose predictor by
modeling rigid 6D head movements with a motion-aware recurrent neural network
(RNN). In this way, the predicted head poses act as the low-frequency holistic
movements of a talking head, thus allowing our latter network to focus on
detailed facial movement generation. To depict the entire image motions arising
from audio, we exploit a keypoint based dense motion field representation.
Then, we develop a motion field generator to produce the dense motion fields
from input audio, head poses, and a reference image. As this keypoint based
representation models the motions of facial regions, head, and backgrounds
integrally, our method can better constrain the spatial and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. Finally, an image generation network is
employed to render photo-realistic talking-head videos from the estimated
keypoint based motion fields and the input reference image. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method produces videos with plausible head
motions, synchronized facial expressions, and stable backgrounds and
outperforms the state-of-the-art.]]></summary>

growth in the inflation rate has compelled people to invest in the stock and
commodity markets and other areas rather than saving. Further, the ability of
Deep Learning models to make predictions on the time series data has been
proven time and again. Technical analysis on the stock market with the help of
technical indicators has been the most common practice among traders and
investors. One more aspect is the sentiment analysis - the emotion of the
investors that shows the willingness to invest. A variety of techniques have
been used by people around the globe involving basic Machine Learning and
Neural Networks. Ranging from the basic linear regression to the advanced
neural networks people have experimented with all possible techniques to
predict the stock market. It's evident from recent events how news and
headlines affect the stock markets and cryptocurrencies. This paper proposes an
ensemble of state-of-the-art methods for predicting stock prices. Firstly
sentiment analysis of the news and the headlines for the company Apple Inc,
listed on the NASDAQ is performed using a version of BERT, which is a
pre-trained transformer model by Google for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Afterward, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) predicts the stock price for
Apple Inc using the technical indicators, stock indexes of various countries,
some commodities, and historical prices along with the sentiment scores.
Comparison is done with baseline models like - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM),
Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), vanilla GAN, and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) model.]]></summary>

Question Answering (VQA) models. To measure generalization to novel questions,
we propose to separate them into "skills" and "concepts". "Skills" are visual
tasks, such as counting or attribute recognition, and are applied to "concepts"
mentioned in the question, such as objects and people. VQA methods should be
able to compose skills and concepts in novel ways, regardless of whether the
specific composition has been seen in training, yet we demonstrate that
existing models have much to improve upon towards handling new compositions. We
present a novel method for learning to compose skills and concepts that
separates these two factors implicitly within a model by learning grounded
concept representations and disentangling the encoding of skills from that of
concepts. We enforce these properties with a novel contrastive learning
procedure that does not rely on external annotations and can be learned from
unlabeled image-question pairs. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach for improving compositional and grounding performance.]]></summary>

natural language is the most effective mode of interaction with humans, these
exchanges are rarely used as an opportunity for learning. Leveraging language
interactions effectively requires addressing limitations in the two most common
approaches to language grounding: semantic parsers built on top of fixed object
categories are precise but inflexible and end-to-end models are maximally
expressive, but fickle and opaque. Our goal is to develop a system that
balances the strengths of each approach so that users can teach agents new
instructions that generalize broadly from a single example. We introduce the
idea of neural abstructions: a set of constraints on the inference procedure of
a label-conditioned generative model that can affect the meaning of the label
in context. Starting from a core programming language that operates over
abstructions, users can define increasingly complex mappings from natural
language to actions. We show that with this method a user population is able to
build a semantic parser for an open-ended house modification task in Minecraft.
The semantic parser that results is both flexible and expressive: the
percentage of utterances sourced from redefinitions increases steadily over the
course of 191 total exchanges, achieving a final value of 28%.]]></summary>

still very useful, e.g, Search Engines (Google Chrome). Speeding them up, in
small additional space with respect to the table being searched into, is still
a quite significant achievement. Static Learned Indexes have been very
successful in achieving such a speed-up, but leave open a major question: To
what extent one can enjoy the speed-up of Learned Indexes while using constant
or nearly constant additional space. By generalizing the experimental
methodology of a recent benchmarking study on Learned Indexes, we shed light on
this question, by considering two scenarios. The first, quite elementary, i.e.,
textbook code, and the second using advanced Learned Indexing algorithms and
the supporting sophisticated software platforms. Although in both cases one
would expect a positive answer, its achievement is not as simple as it seems.
Indeed, our extensive set of experiments reveal a complex relationship between
query time and model space. The findings regarding this relationship and the
corresponding quantitative estimates, across memory levels, can be of interest
to algorithm designers and of use to practitioners as well. As an essential
part of our research, we introduce two new models that are of interest in their

implicitly encode likelihood functions of complex systems. Classical
statistical methods are poorly suited for these so-called likelihood-free
inference (LFI) settings, outside the asymptotic and low-dimensional regimes.
Although new machine learning methods, such as normalizing flows, have
revolutionized the sample efficiency and capacity of LFI methods, it remains an
open question whether they produce reliable measures of uncertainty. This paper
presents a statistical framework for LFI that unifies classical statistics with
modern machine learning to: (1) efficiently construct frequentist confidence
sets and hypothesis tests with finite-sample guarantees of nominal coverage
(type I error control) and power; (2) provide practical diagnostics for
assessing empirical coverage over the entire parameter space. We refer to our
framework as likelihood-free frequentist inference (LF2I). Any method that
estimates a test statistic, like the likelihood ratio, can be plugged into our
framework to create valid confidence sets and compute diagnostics, without
costly Monte Carlo samples at fixed parameter settings. In this work, we
specifically study the power of two test statistics (ACORE and BFF), which,
respectively, maximize versus integrate an odds function over the parameter

total reward while obeying safety constraints. Although much recent research
has focused on the development of safe reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
that produce a safe policy after training, ensuring safety during training as
well remains an open problem. A fundamental challenge is performing exploration
while still satisfying constraints in an unknown Markov decision process (MDP).
In this work, we address this problem for the chance-constrained setting. We
propose a new algorithm, SAILR, that uses an intervention mechanism based on
advantage functions to keep the agent safe throughout training and optimizes
the agent's policy using off-the-shelf RL algorithms designed for unconstrained
MDPs. Our method comes with strong guarantees on safety during both training
and deployment (i.e., after training and without the intervention mechanism)
and policy performance compared to the optimal safety-constrained policy. In

generates a strong demand for explanations that are robust to noise and align
well with human intuition. Most existing methods generate explanations by
identifying a subgraph of an input graph that has a strong correlation with the
prediction. These explanations are not robust to noise because independently
optimizing the correlation for a single input can easily overfit noise.
Moreover, they do not align well with human intuition because removing an
identified subgraph from an input graph does not necessarily change the
prediction result. In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate robust
counterfactual explanations on GNNs by explicitly modelling the common decision
logic of GNNs on similar input graphs. Our explanations are naturally robust to
noise because they are produced from the common decision boundaries of a GNN
that govern the predictions of many similar input graphs. The explanations also
align well with human intuition because removing the set of edges identified by
an explanation from the input graph changes the prediction significantly.
Exhaustive experiments on many public datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our method.]]></summary>

observations are taken either of the atmosphere or looking through the
atmosphere. Atmospheric correction errors can significantly alter the spectral
signature of the observations, and lead to invalid classifications or target
detection. This is even more crucial when working with hyperspectral data,
where a precise measurement of spectral properties is required.
State-of-the-art physics-based atmospheric correction approaches require
extensive prior knowledge about sensor characteristics, collection geometry,
and environmental characteristics of the scene being collected. These
approaches are computationally expensive, prone to inaccuracy due to lack of
sufficient environmental and collection information, and often impossible for
real-time applications. In this paper, a geometry-dependent hybrid neural
network is proposed for automatic atmospheric correction using multi-scan
hyperspectral data collected from different geometries. The proposed network
can characterize the atmosphere without any additional meteorological data. A
grid-search method is also proposed to solve the temperature emissivity
separation problem. Results show that the proposed network has the capacity to
accurately characterize the atmosphere and estimate target emissivity spectra
with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) under 0.02 for 29 different materials. This
solution can lead to accurate atmospheric correction to improve target
detection for real time applications.]]></summary>

generating mind-blowing photorealistic images that mimic the content of
datasets they were trained to replicate. One recurrent theme in medical imaging
is whether GANs can also be effective at generating workable medical data as
they are for generating realistic RGB images. In this paper, we perform a
multi-GAN and multi-application study to gauge the benefits of GANs in medical
imaging. We tested various GAN architectures from basic DCGAN to more
sophisticated style-based GANs on three medical imaging modalities and organs
namely : cardiac cine-MRI, liver CT and RGB retina images. GANs were trained on
well-known and widely utilized datasets from which their FID score were
computed to measure the visual acuity of their generated images. We further
tested their usefulness by measuring the segmentation accuracy of a U-Net
trained on these generated images.

Results reveal that GANs are far from being equal as some are ill-suited for
medical imaging applications while others are much better off. The
top-performing GANs are capable of generating realistic-looking medical images
by FID standards that can fool trained experts in a visual Turing test and
comply to some metrics. However, segmentation results suggests that no GAN is
capable of reproducing the full richness of a medical datasets.]]></summary>

Unlike fully unsupervised hierarchical clustering, the choice of grouping and
complexity criteria stems naturally from supervision in the training set. The
resulting method, Hi-LANDER, achieves an average of 54% improvement in F-score

that allows a large number of clients to train a joint model without the need
to share their private data. Participants instead only share ephemeral updates
necessary to train the model. To ensure the confidentiality of the client
updates, Federated Learning systems employ secure aggregation; clients encrypt
their gradient updates, and only the aggregated model is revealed to the
server. Achieving this level of data protection, however, presents new
challenges to the robustness of Federated Learning, i.e., the ability to
tolerate failures and attacks. Unfortunately, in this setting, a malicious
client can now easily exert influence on the model behavior without being
detected. As Federated Learning is being deployed in practice in a range of
sensitive applications, its robustness is growing in importance. In this paper,
we take a step towards understanding and improving the robustness of secure
Federated Learning. We start this paper with a systematic study that evaluates
and analyzes existing attack vectors and discusses potential defenses and
assesses their effectiveness. We then present RoFL, a secure Federated Learning
system that improves robustness against malicious clients through input checks
on the encrypted model updates. RoFL extends Federated Learning's secure
aggregation protocol to allow expressing a variety of properties and
constraints on model updates using zero-knowledge proofs. To enable RoFL to
scale to typical Federated Learning settings, we introduce several ML and
cryptographic optimizations specific to Federated Learning. We implement and
evaluate a prototype of RoFL and show that realistic ML models can be trained

algorithms can efficiently classify a wide range of quantum phases of matter.
Our arguments are based on the concept of a classical shadow, a succinct
classical description of a many-body quantum state that can be constructed in
feasible quantum experiments and be used to predict many properties of the

significant damage can be caused if an attacker is able to modify the code of
their programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Unfortunately, traditional
techniques for attesting code integrity (i.e. verifying that it has not been
modified) rely on firmware access or roots-of-trust, neither of which
proprietary or legacy PLCs are likely to provide. In this paper, we propose a
practical code integrity checking solution based on privacy-preserving black
box models that instead attest the input/output behaviour of PLC programs.
Using faithful offline copies of the PLC programs, we identify their most
important inputs through an information flow analysis, execute them on multiple
combinations to collect data, then train neural networks able to predict PLC
outputs (i.e. actuator commands) from their inputs. By exploiting the black box
nature of the model, our solution maintains the privacy of the original PLC
code and does not assume that attackers are unaware of its presence. The trust
instead comes from the fact that it is extremely hard to attack the PLC code
and neural networks at the same time and with consistent outcomes. We evaluated
our approach on a modern six-stage water treatment plant testbed, finding that
it could predict actuator states from PLC inputs with near-100% accuracy, and
thus could detect all 120 effective code mutations that we subjected the PLCs
to. Finally, we found that it is not practically possible to simultaneously
modify the PLC code and apply discreet adversarial noise to our attesters in a
way that leads to consistent (mis-)predictions.]]></summary>

concepts. Deep learning classifiers link the most basic version of concepts at
the input layer to the most abstract version of concepts at the output layer,
also known as a class or label. However, once trained over a finite set of
classes, some deep learning models do not have the power to say that a given
input does not belong to any of the classes and simply cannot be linked.
Correctly invalidating the prediction of unrelated classes is a challenging
problem that has been tackled in many ways in the literature. Novelty detection
gives deep learning the ability to output "do not know" for novel/unseen
classes. Still, no attention has been given to the security aspects of novelty
detection. In this paper, we consider the case study of abstraction-based
novelty detection and show that it is not robust against adversarial samples.
Moreover, we show the feasibility of crafting adversarial samples that fool the
deep learning classifier and bypass the novelty detection monitoring at the

networks have direct parallels in finite state machines, allowing clear
discussion and thought around architecture variants or trained models,
Transformers have no such familiar parallel. In this paper we aim to change
that, proposing a computational model for the transformer-encoder in the form
of a programming language. We map the basic components of a transformer-encoder
-- attention and feed-forward computation -- into simple primitives, around
which we form a programming language: the Restricted Access Sequence Processing
Language (RASP). We show how RASP can be used to program solutions to tasks
that could conceivably be learned by a Transformer, and how a Transformer can
be trained to mimic a RASP solution. In particular, we provide RASP programs
for histograms, sorting, and Dyck-languages. We further use our model to relate
their difficulty in terms of the number of required layers and attention heads:
analyzing a RASP program implies a maximum number of heads and layers necessary
to encode a task in a transformer. Finally, we see how insights gained from our
abstraction might be used to explain phenomena seen in recent works.]]></summary>

learning and deep learning. However, computing discrete optimal transport plan
for large scale problems with adequate accuracy and efficiency is still highly
challenging. Recently, methods based on the Sinkhorn algorithm add an entropy
regularizer to the prime problem and get a trade off between efficiency and
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to further improve the
efficiency and accuracy based on Nesterov's smoothing technique. Basically, the
non-smooth c-transform of the Kantorovich potential is approximated by the
smooth Log-Sum-Exp function, which finally smooths the original non-smooth
Kantorovich dual functional (energy). The smooth Kantorovich functional can be
optimized by the fast proximal gradient algorithm (FISTA) efficiently.
Theoretically, the computational complexity of the proposed method is given by
$O(n^{\frac{5}{2}} \sqrt{\log n} /\epsilon)$, which is lower than that of the
Sinkhorn algorithm. Empirically, compared with the Sinkhorn algorithm, our
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves faster
convergence and better accuracy with the same parameter.]]></summary>

on unseen target domains with different statistics, is a challenging problem.
While many approaches have been proposed to solve this problem, they only
utilize source data during training but do not take advantage of the fact that
a single target example is available at the time of inference. Motivated by
this, we propose a method that effectively uses the target sample during
inference beyond mere classification. Our method has three components - (i) A
label-preserving feature or metric transformation on source data such that the
source samples are clustered in accordance with their class irrespective of
their domain (ii) A generative model trained on the these features (iii) A
label-preserving projection of the target point on the source-feature manifold
during inference via solving an optimization problem on the input space of the
generative model using the learned metric. Finally, the projected target is
used in the classifier. Since the projected target feature comes from the
source manifold and has the same label as the real target by design, the
classifier is expected to perform better on it than the true target. We
demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art Domain
Generalization methods on multiple datasets and tasks.]]></summary>

requirements (e.g., collecting outlier data and hyperparameter validation) and
produce side effects (classification accuracy drop and slow/inefficient
inferences). Recently, entropic out-of-distribution detection has been proposed
as a seamless approach (i.e., a solution that avoids all the previously
mentioned drawbacks). The entropic out-of-distribution detection solution
comprises the IsoMax loss for training and the entropic score for
out-of-distribution detection. The IsoMax loss works as a SoftMax loss drop-in
replacement because swapping the SoftMax loss with the IsoMax loss requires no
changes in the model's architecture or training procedures/hyperparameters. In
this paper, we propose to perform what we call an isometrization of the
distances used in the IsoMax loss. Additionally, we propose to replace the
entropic score with the minimum distance score. Our experiments showed that
these simple modifications increase out-of-distribution detection performance
while keeping the solution seamless. Code available at

training relies on a sizable set of high-quality original datasets. Due to
privacy and security issues, the original datasets are usually unavailable
directly. Recently, federated learning proposes a popular distributed machine
learning paradigm with an enhanced privacy protection mechanism. It offers a
practical and secure framework for data owners to collaborate with others, thus
obtaining a better global model trained on the larger dataset. However, due to
the high complexity of transformer models, the convergence process becomes slow
and unstable in the federated learning setting. Besides, the transformer model
trained in federated learning is costly communication and limited computational
speed on clients, impeding its popularity. To deal with these challenges, we
propose the federated dynamic transformer. On the one hand, the performance is
greatly improved comparing with the federated transformer, approaching
centralize-trained Transformer-TTS when increasing clients number. On the other
hand, it achieves faster and more stable convergence in the training phase and
significantly reduces communication time. Experiments on the LJSpeech dataset
also strongly prove our method's advantage.]]></summary>

deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In practice, the reward shaping-based
approaches are leveraged to provide intrinsic rewards for the agent to
incentivize motivation. However, most existing IRS modules rely on attendant
models or additional memory to record and analyze learning procedures, which
leads to high computational complexity and low robustness. Moreover, they
overemphasize the influence of a single state on exploration, which cannot
evaluate the exploration performance from a global perspective. To tackle the
problem, state entropy-based methods are proposed to encourage the agent to
visit the state space more equitably. However, the estimation error and sample
complexity are prohibitive when handling environments with high-dimensional
observation. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric entitled Jain's
fairness index (JFI) to replace the entropy regularizer, which requires no
additional models or memory. In particular, JFI overcomes the vanishing
intrinsic rewards problem and can be generalized into arbitrary tasks.
Furthermore, we use a variational auto-encoder (VAE) model to capture the
life-long novelty of states. Finally, the global JFI score and local state
novelty are combined to form a multimodal intrinsic reward, controlling the
exploration extent more precisely. Finally, extensive simulation results
demonstrate that our multimodal reward shaping (MMRS) method can achieve higher
performance in contrast to other benchmark schemes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce the \textit{epistemic neural network} (ENN) as an interface for
uncertainty modeling in deep learning. All existing approaches to uncertainty
modeling can be expressed as ENNs, and any ENN can be identified with a
Bayesian neural network. However, this new perspective provides several
promising directions for future research. Where prior work has developed
probabilistic inference tools for neural networks; we ask instead, `which
neural networks are suitable as tools for probabilistic inference?'. We propose
a clear and simple metric for progress in ENNs: the KL-divergence with respect
to a target distribution. We develop a computational testbed based on inference
in a neural network Gaussian process and release our code as a benchmark at
\url{https://github.com/deepmind/enn}. We evaluate several canonical approaches
to uncertainty modeling in deep learning, and find they vary greatly in their
performance. We provide insight to the sensitivity of these results and show
that our metric is highly correlated with performance in sequential decision
problems. Finally, we provide indications that new ENN architectures can
improve performance in both the statistical quality and computational cost.]]></summary>

network(CNN) named Feature Mining, that aims to strengthen the network's
learning of the local feature. Through experiments, we find that semantic
contained in different parts of the feature is different, while the network
will inevitably lose the local information during feedforward propagation. In
order to enhance the learning of local feature, Feature Mining divides the
complete feature into two complementary parts and reuse these divided feature
to make the network learn more local information, we call the two steps as
feature segmentation and feature reusing. Feature Mining is a parameter-free
method and has plug-and-play nature, and can be applied to any CNN models.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the wide applicability, versatility, and

impressive performance improvements on thermal to visible face synthesis and
matching problems. However, current DCNN-based synthesis models do not perform
well on thermal faces with large pose variations. In order to deal with this
problem, heterogeneous face frontalization methods are needed in which a model
takes a thermal profile face image and generates a frontal visible face. This
is an extremely difficult problem due to the large domain as well as large pose
discrepancies between the two modalities. Despite its applications in
biometrics and surveillance, this problem is relatively unexplored in the
literature. We propose a domain agnostic learning-based generative adversarial
network (DAL-GAN) which can synthesize frontal views in the visible domain from
thermal faces with pose variations. DAL-GAN consists of a generator with an
auxiliary classifier and two discriminators which capture both local and global
texture discriminations for better synthesis. A contrastive constraint is
enforced in the latent space of the generator with the help of a dual-path
training strategy, which improves the feature vector discrimination. Finally, a
multi-purpose loss function is utilized to guide the network in synthesizing
identity preserving cross-domain frontalization. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that DAL-GAN can generate better quality frontal views compared to
the other baseline methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated learning is a widely used distributed deep learning framework that
protects the privacy of each client by exchanging model parameters rather than
raw data. However, federated learning suffers from high communication costs, as
a considerable number of model parameters need to be transmitted many times
during the training process, making the approach inefficient, especially when
the communication network bandwidth is limited. This article proposes RingFed,
a novel framework to reduce communication overhead during the training process
of federated learning. Rather than transmitting parameters between the center
server and each client, as in original federated learning, in the proposed
RingFed, the updated parameters are transmitted between each client in turn,
and only the final result is transmitted to the central server, thereby
reducing the communication overhead substantially. After several local updates,
clients first send their parameters to another proximal client, not to the
center server directly, to preaggregate. Experiments on two different public
datasets show that RingFed has fast convergence, high model accuracy, and low
communication cost.]]></summary>

personalized medicine in healthcare. We observed notable challenges in
identifying robust biomarkers as some with great performance in one scenario
often fail to perform well in new trials (e.g. different population,
indications). With rapid development in the clinical trial world (e.g. assay,
disease definition), new trials very likely differ from legacy ones in many
perspectives and in development of biomarkers this heterogeneity should be
considered. In response, we recommend considering building in the heterogeneity
when evaluating biomarkers. In this paper, we present one evaluation strategy
by using leave-one-study-out (LOSO) in place of conventional cross-validation
(cv) methods to account for the potential heterogeneity across trials used for
building and testing the biomarkers. To demonstrate the performance of K-fold
vs LOSO cv in estimating the effect size of biomarkers, we leveraged data from
clinical trials and simulation studies. In our assessment, LOSO cv provided a
more objective estimate of the future performance. This conclusion remained
true across different evaluation metrics and different statistical methods.]]></summary>

literature assume that data are a homogeneous set of observations; whereas it
is often the case that they comprise different related, but not homogeneous,
data sets collected in different ways. In this paper we propose a new Bayesian
Dirichlet score, which we call Bayesian Hierarchical Dirichlet (BHD). The
proposed score is based on a hierarchical model that pools information across
data sets to learn a single encompassing network structure, while taking into
account the differences in their probabilistic structures. We derive a
closed-form expression for BHD using a variational approximation of the
marginal likelihood, we study the associated computational cost and we evaluate
its performance using simulated data. We find that, when data comprise multiple
related data sets, BHD outperforms the Bayesian Dirichlet equivalent uniform
(BDeu) score in terms of reconstruction accuracy as measured by the Structural
Hamming distance, and that it is as accurate as BDeu when data are homogeneous.
This improvement is particularly clear when either the number of variables in
the network or the number of observations is large. Moreover, the estimated
networks are sparser and therefore more interpretable than those obtained with
BDeu thanks to a lower number of false positive arcs.]]></summary>

such as easing traffic congestion in unusual events and evacuating people from
an emergency-affected area. To grab the reins of crowds, there has been
considerable demand for a decision support system that can answer a typical
question: ``what will be the outcomes of each of the possible options in the
current situation. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the
effects of crowd movement guidance from past data. To cope with limited amount
of available data biased by past decision-makers, we leverage two recent
techniques in deep representation learning for spatial data analysis and causal
inference. We use a spatial convolutional operator to extract effective spatial
features of crowds from a small amount of data and use balanced representation
learning based on the integral probability metrics to mitigate the selection
bias and missing counterfactual outcomes. To evaluate the performance on
estimating the treatment effects of possible guidance, we use a multi-agent
simulator to generate realistic data on evacuation scenarios in a crowded
theater, since there are no available datasets recording outcomes of all
possible crowd movement guidance. The results of three experiments demonstrate
that our proposed method reduces the estimation error by at most 56% from
state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

networks, and hypothesis classes with inferior approximation capacity such as
shallow networks or kernel classes. On the other hand, the fact that deep
networks can efficiently express a target function does not mean that this
target function can be learned efficiently by deep neural networks. In this
work we study the intricate connection between learnability and approximation
capacity. We show that learnability with deep networks of a target function
depends on the ability of simpler classes to approximate the target.
Specifically, we show that a necessary condition for a function to be learnable
by gradient descent on deep neural networks is to be able to approximate the
function, at least in a weak sense, with shallow neural networks. We also show
that a class of functions can be learned by an efficient statistical query
algorithm if and only if it can be approximated in a weak sense by some kernel
class. We give several examples of functions which demonstrate depth
separation, and conclude that they cannot be efficiently learned, even by a
hypothesis class that can efficiently approximate them.]]></summary>

usually clustered by first removing incomplete cases or features with missing
values, or by imputing missing values, followed by application of a clustering
algorithm to the resulting altered dataset. Here, we develop clustering
methodology through a model-based approach using the marginal density for the
observed values, assuming a finite mixture model of multivariate $t$
distributions. We compare our approximate algorithm to the corresponding full
expectation-maximization (EM) approach that considers the missing values in the
incomplete data set and makes a missing at random (MAR) assumption, as well as
case deletion and imputation methods. Since only the observed values are
utilized, our approach is computationally more efficient than imputation or
full EM. Simulation studies demonstrate that our approach has favorable
recovery of the true cluster partition compared to case deletion and imputation
under various missingness mechanisms, and is at least competitive with the full
EM approach, even when MAR assumptions are violated. Our methodology is
demonstrated on a problem of clustering gamma-ray bursts and is implemented at

arise in attempts to provide the true class labels for the unclassified data

biometric identification, and has been ubiquitous implemented in
security-critic applications, such as banking and access control. However,
previous works have shown that ASV is under the radar of adversarial attacks,
which are very similar to their original counterparts from human's perception,
yet will manipulate the ASV render wrong prediction. Due to the very late
emergence of adversarial attacks for ASV, effective countermeasures against
them are limited. Given that the security of ASV is of high priority, in this
work, we propose the idea of "voting for the right answer" to prevent risky
decisions of ASV in blind spot areas, by employing random sampling and voting.
Experimental results show that our proposed method improves the robustness
against both the limited-knowledge attackers by pulling the adversarial samples
out of the blind spots, and the perfect-knowledge attackers by introducing
randomness and increasing the attackers' budgets.]]></summary>

neural networks (GNNs) use neighborhood aggregation as a core component that
results in feature smoothing among nodes in proximity. While successful in
various prediction tasks, such a paradigm falls short of capturing nodes'
similarities over a long distance, which proves to be important for
high-quality learning. To tackle this problem, we strengthen the graph with two
additional graph views, in which nodes are directly linked to those with the
most similar features or local structures. Not restricted by connectivity in
the original graph, the generated views allow the model to enhance its
expressive power with new and complementary perspectives from which to look at
the relationship between nodes. Following a contrastive learning approach, we
propose a method that aims to maximize the agreement between representations
across generated views and the original graph. We also propose a channel-level
contrast approach that greatly reduces computation cost, compared to the
commonly used node level contrast, which requires computation cost quadratic in
the number of nodes. Extensive experiments on seven assortative graphs and four

generation for their potential ability to produce reasonable predictable energy
without the emission of greenhouse gases. Once the main forcing components for
driving the tides have deterministic dynamics, the available energy in a given
tidal power plant has been estimated, through analytical and numerical
optimisation routines, as a mostly predictable event. This constraint imposes
state-of-art flexible operation methods to rely on tidal predictions
(concurrent with measured data and up to a multiple of half-tidal cycles into
the future) to infer best operational strategies for tidal lagoons, with the
additional cost of requiring to run optimisation routines for every new tide.
In this paper, we propose a novel optimised operation of tidal lagoons with
proximal policy optimisation through Unity ML-Agents. We compare this technique
with 6 different operation optimisation approaches (baselines) devised from the
literature, utilising the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon as a case study. We show
that our approach is successful in maximising energy generation through an
optimised operational policy of turbines and sluices, yielding competitive
results with state-of-the-art methods of optimisation, regardless of test data
used, requiring training once and performing real-time flexible control with

which determines the distribution of samples. In this setting, Minimum Excess
Risk (MER) is defined as the difference between the minimum expected loss
achievable when learning from data and the minimum expected loss that could be
achieved if $W$ was observed. In this paper, we build upon and extend the
recent results of (Xu & Raginsky, 2020) to analyze the MER in Bayesian learning
and derive information-theoretic bounds on it. We formulate the problem as a
(constrained) rate-distortion optimization and show how the solution can be
bounded above and below by two other rate-distortion functions that are easier
to study. The lower bound represents the minimum possible excess risk
achievable by any process using $R$ bits of information from the parameter $W$.
For the upper bound, the optimization is further constrained to use $R$ bits
from the training set, a setting which relates MER to information-theoretic
bounds on the generalization gap in frequentist learning. We derive
information-theoretic bounds on the difference between these upper and lower
bounds and show that they can provide order-wise tight rates for MER under
certain conditions. This analysis gives more insight into the
information-theoretic nature of Bayesian learning as well as providing novel
bounds.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motivation: Computational models that accurately identify high-affinity
protein-compound pairs can accelerate drug discovery pipelines. These models
aim to learn binding mechanics through drug-target interaction datasets and use
the learned knowledge for predicting the affinity of an input protein-compound
pair. However, the datasets they rely on bear misleading patterns that bias
models towards memorizing dataset-specific biomolecule properties, instead of
learning binding mechanics. This results in models that struggle while
predicting drug-target affinities (DTA), especially between de novo
biomolecules. Here we present DebiasedDTA, the first DTA model debiasing
approach that avoids dataset biases in order to boost affinity prediction for
novel biomolecules. DebiasedDTA uses ensemble learning and sample weight
adaptation for bias identification and avoidance and is applicable to almost
all existing DTA prediction models. Results: The results show that DebiasedDTA
can boost models while predicting the interactions between novel biomolecules.
Known biomolecules also benefit from the performance improvement, especially
when the test biomolecules are dissimilar to the training set. The experiments
also show that DebiasedDTA can augment DTA prediction models of different input
and model structures and is able to avoid biases of different sources.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background and objective: In this paper, a modified U-Net based framework is
presented, which leverages techniques from Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block,
Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and residual learning for accurate and
robust liver CT segmentation, and the effectiveness of the proposed method was
tested on two public datasets LiTS17 and SLiver07.

Methods: A new network architecture called SAR-U-Net was designed. Firstly,
the SE block is introduced to adaptively extract image features after each
convolution in the U-Net encoder, while suppressing irrelevant regions, and
highlighting features of specific segmentation task; Secondly, ASPP was
employed to replace the transition layer and the output layer, and acquire
multi-scale image information via different receptive fields. Thirdly, to
alleviate the degradation problem, the traditional convolution block was
replaced with the residual block and thus prompt the network to gain accuracy
from considerably increased depth.

Results: In the LiTS17 experiment, the mean values of Dice, VOE, RVD, ASD and
MSD were 95.71, 9.52, -0.84, 1.54 and 29.14, respectively. Compared with other
closely related 2D-based models, the proposed method achieved the highest
accuracy. In the experiment of the SLiver07, the mean values of Dice, VOE, RVD,
ASD and MSD were 97.31, 5.37, -1.08, 1.85 and 27.45, respectively. Compared
with other closely related models, the proposed method achieved the highest
segmentation accuracy except for the RVD.

Conclusion: The proposed model enables a great improvement on the accuracy
compared to 2D-based models, and its robustness in circumvent challenging
problems, such as small liver regions, discontinuous liver regions, and fuzzy
liver boundaries, is also well demonstrated and validated.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In deep learning with differential privacy (DP), the neural network achieves
the privacy usually at the cost of slower convergence (and thus lower
performance) than its non-private counterpart. This work gives the first
convergence analysis of the DP deep learning, through the lens of training
dynamics and the neural tangent kernel (NTK). Our convergence theory
successfully characterizes the effects of two key components in the DP
training: the per-sample clipping (flat or layerwise) and the noise addition.
Our analysis not only initiates a general principled framework to understand
the DP deep learning with any network architecture and loss function, but also
motivates a new clipping method -- the global clipping, that significantly
improves the convergence while preserving the same privacy guarantee as the
existing local clipping.

In terms of theoretical results, we establish the precise connection between
the per-sample clipping and NTK matrix. We show that in the gradient flow,
i.e., with infinitesimal learning rate, the noise level of DP optimizers does
not affect the convergence. We prove that DP gradient descent (GD) with global
clipping guarantees the monotone convergence to zero loss, which can be
violated by the existing DP-GD with local clipping. Notably, our analysis
framework easily extends to other optimizers, e.g., DP-Adam. Empirically
speaking, DP optimizers equipped with global clipping perform strongly on a
wide range of classification and regression tasks. In particular, our global
clipping is surprisingly effective at learning calibrated classifiers, in
contrast to the existing DP classifiers which are oftentimes over-confident and
unreliable. Implementation-wise, the new clipping can be realized by adding one
line of code into the Opacus library.]]></summary>

the future to maintain stable and economic power system operation. To tackle
this challenge, a deep neural network-based voltage-constrained approach
(DeepOPF-V) is proposed to solve AC-OPF problems with high computational
efficiency. Its unique design predicts voltages of all buses and then uses them
to reconstruct the remaining variables without solving non-linear AC power flow
equations. A fast post-processing process is developed to enforce the box
constraints. The effectiveness of DeepOPF-V is validated by simulations on IEEE
118/300-bus systems and a 2000-bus test system. Compared with existing studies,
DeepOPF-V achieves decent computation speedup up to four orders of magnitude
and comparable performance in optimality gap and preserving the feasibility of

finding a feasible solution for (mixed) integer programming (MIP) problems.
Finding a feasible solution for MIP problems is critical because many
successful heuristics rely on a known initial feasible solution. However, it is
in general NP-hard. Inspired by the feasibility pump (FP), a well-known
heuristic for searching feasible MIP solutions, we develop a smart feasibility
pump (SFP) method using DRL. In addition to multi-layer perception (MLP), we
propose a novel convolution neural network (CNN) structure for the policy
network to capture the hidden information of the constraint matrix of the MIP
problem. Numerical experiments on various problem instances show that SFP
significantly outperforms the classic FP in terms of the number of steps
required to reach the first feasible solution. Moreover, the CNN structure
works without the projection of the current solution as the input, which saves
the computational effort at each step of the FP algorithms to find projections.
This highlights the representational power of the CNN structure.]]></summary>

robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. However, existing methods assume
that training and testing data are from the same domain, which suffers from
severe performance degradation when a domain gap exists, such as the simulator
and real robot. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised domain
adaptation framework which can simultaneously transfer multi-modality
knowledge, i.e., both kinematic and visual data, from simulator to real robot.
It remedies the domain gap with enhanced transferable features by using
temporal cues in videos, and inherent correlations in multi-modal towards
recognizing gesture. Specifically, we first propose an MDO-K to align
kinematics, which exploits temporal continuity to transfer motion directions
with smaller gap rather than position values, relieving the adaptation burden.
Moreover, we propose a KV-Relation-ATT to transfer the co-occurrence signals of
kinematics and vision. Such features attended by correlation similarity are
more informative for enhancing domain-invariance of the model. Two feature
alignment strategies benefit the model mutually during the end-to-end learning
process. We extensively evaluate our method for gesture recognition using DESK
dataset with peg transfer procedure. Results show that our approach recovers
the performance with great improvement gains, up to 12.91% in ACC and 20.16% in

protein interaction networks lack such contextualization, thereby limiting the
study of where protein interactions likely occur in the human body and how they

reflects network topology at a single-cell resolution. We construct a

cell type, and tissue embeddings that uphold cell type and tissue hierarchies.
We demonstrate AWARE's utility on the novel task of predicting whether a
protein is altered in disease and where that association most likely manifests
in the human body. To this end, AWARE outperforms generic embeddings without
contextual information by at least 12.5%, showing AWARE's potential to reveal

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper concentrates on the approximation power of deep feed-forward
neural networks in terms of width and depth. It is proved by construction that
ReLU networks with width $\mathcal{O}\big(\max\{d\lfloor N^{1/d}\rfloor,\,
N+2\}\big)$ and depth $\mathcal{O}(L)$ can approximate a H\"older continuous
function on $[0,1]^d$ with an approximation rate
$\mathcal{O}\big(\lambda\sqrt{d} (N^2L^2\ln N)^{-\alpha/d}\big)$, where
$\alpha\in (0,1]$ and $\lambda>0$ are H\"older order and constant,
respectively. Such a rate is optimal up to a constant in terms of width and
depth separately, while existing results are only nearly optimal without the
logarithmic factor in the approximation rate. More generally, for an arbitrary
continuous function $f$ on $[0,1]^d$, the approximation rate becomes
$\mathcal{O}\big(\,\sqrt{d}\,\omega_f\big( (N^2L^2\ln N)^{-1/d}\big)\,\big)$,
where $\omega_f(\cdot)$ is the modulus of continuity. We also extend our
analysis to any continuous function $f$ on a bounded set. Particularly, if ReLU
networks with depth $31$ and width $\mathcal{O}(N)$ are used to approximate
one-dimensional Lipschitz continuous functions on $[0,1]$ with a Lipschitz
constant $\lambda>0$, the approximation rate in terms of the total number of
parameters, $W=\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, becomes $\mathcal{O}(\tfrac{\lambda}{W\ln
W})$, which has not been discovered in the literature for fixed-depth ReLU
networks.]]></summary>

humans yet challenging for machines to reproduce. This is because most learning

aims to achieve OOD generalization by using only source data for model
learning. Since first introduced in 2011, research in DG has made great
progresses. In particular, intensive research in this topic has led to a broad
spectrum of methodologies, e.g., those based on domain alignment,
meta-learning, data augmentation, or ensemble learning, just to name a few; and
has covered various vision applications such as object recognition,
segmentation, action recognition, and person re-identification. In this paper,
for the first time a comprehensive literature review is provided to summarize
the developments in DG for computer vision over the past decade. Specifically,
we first cover the background by formally defining DG and relating it to other
research fields like domain adaptation and transfer learning. Second, we

the Shattering coefficient function $\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{F},n)$ to upper bound
the empirical risk minimization principle, from which one can estimate the

equivalence relations from Topology, data separability results by Har-Peled and

worst and best-case classification scenarios and the respective $\Omega$ and
$O$ complexities; (ii) the estimation of the training sample sizes required to

summary of disease-related information about patients. Such coding is usually
done manually in hospitals but could potentially be automated to improve the
efficiency and accuracy of medical coding. Recent studies on deep learning for
automated medical coding achieved promising performances. However, the
explainability of these models is usually poor, preventing them to be used
confidently in supporting clinical practice. Another limitation is that these
models mostly assume independence among labels, ignoring the complex
correlation among medical codes which can potentially be exploited to improve
the performance. We propose a Hierarchical Label-wise Attention Network (HLAN),
which aimed to interpret the model by quantifying importance (as attention
weights) of words and sentences related to each of the labels. Secondly, we
propose to enhance the major deep learning models with a label embedding (LE)
initialisation approach, which learns a dense, continuous vector representation
and then injects the representation into the final layers and the label-wise
attention layers in the models. We evaluated the methods using three settings
on the MIMIC-III discharge summaries: full codes, top-50 codes, and the UK NHS
COVID-19 shielding codes. Experiments were conducted to compare HLAN and LE
initialisation to the state-of-the-art neural network based methods. HLAN
achieved the best Micro-level AUC and $F_1$ on the top-50 code prediction and
comparable results on the NHS COVID-19 shielding code prediction to other
models. By highlighting the most salient words and sentences for each label,
HLAN showed more meaningful and comprehensive model interpretation compared to
its downgraded baselines and the CNN-based models. LE initialisation
consistently boosted most deep learning models for automated medical coding.]]></summary>

generalization. In general, model training harnesses information contained in
the sample-sample second moment matrix of a dataset. For a general class of
models, namely models with a fully connected first layer, we prove that the
information contained in this matrix is the only information which can be used
to generalize. Models trained using whitened data, or with certain second order
optimization schemes, have less access to this information, resulting in
reduced or nonexistent generalization ability. We experimentally verify these
predictions for several architectures, and further demonstrate that
generalization continues to be harmed even when theoretical requirements are
relaxed. However, we also show experimentally that regularized second order
optimization can provide a practical tradeoff, where training is accelerated
but less information is lost, and generalization can in some circumstances even
improve.]]></summary>

discover possible interactions and autonomously build repertoires of skills is
a general objective of artificial intelligence. Developmental approaches argue
that this can only be achieved by autonomous and intrinsically motivated
learning agents that can generate, select and learn to solve their own
problems. In recent years, we have seen a convergence of developmental
approaches, and developmental robotics in particular, with deep reinforcement
learning (RL) methods, forming the new domain of developmental machine
learning. Within this new domain, we review here a set of methods where deep RL
algorithms are trained to tackle the developmental robotics problem of the
autonomous acquisition of open-ended repertoires of skills. Intrinsically
motivated goal-conditioned RL algorithms train agents to learn to represent,
generate and pursue their own goals. The self-generation of goals requires the
learning of compact goal encodings as well as their associated goal-achievement
functions, which results in new challenges compared to traditional RL
algorithms designed to tackle pre-defined sets of goals using external reward
signals. This paper proposes a typology of these methods at the intersection of
deep RL and developmental approaches, surveys recent approaches and discusses
future avenues.]]></summary>

with neural networks as a differentiable layer. In contrast to other
differentiable physics approaches that use explicit forward models to define
state transitions, we focus on implicit state transitions defined via function
minimization. Implicit state transitions appear in implicit numerical
integration methods, which offer the benefits of large time steps and excellent
numerical stability, but require a special treatment to achieve
differentiability due to the absence of an explicit differentiable forward
pass. In contrast to other implicit differentiation approaches that require
explicit formulas for the force function and the force Jacobian matrix, we
present an energy-based approach that allows us to compute these derivatives
automatically and in a matrix-free fashion via reverse-mode automatic
differentiation. This allows for more flexibility and productivity when
defining physical models and is particularly important in the context of neural
network training, which often relies on reverse-mode automatic differentiation
(backpropagation). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our differentiable
simulator in policy optimization for locomotion tasks and show that it achieves
better sample efficiency than model-free reinforcement learning.]]></summary>

remarkable success due to their class-wise controllability and superior quality
for complex generation tasks. Typical cGANs solve the joint distribution
matching problem by decomposing two easier sub-problems: marginal matching and
conditional matching. From our toy experiments, we found that it is the best to
apply only conditional matching to certain samples due to the content-aware
optimization of the discriminator. This paper proposes a simple (a few lines of
code) but effective training methodology, selective focusing learning, which
enforces the discriminator and generator to learn easy samples of each class
rapidly while maintaining diversity. Our key idea is to selectively apply
conditional and joint matching for the data in each mini-batch. We conducted
experiments on recent cGAN variants in ImageNet (64x64 and 128x128), CIFAR-10,
and CIFAR-100 datasets, and improved the performance significantly (up to
35.18% in terms of FID) without sacrificing diversity.]]></summary>

vision, which brings new challenges such as small object inference, background
clutter and wide viewpoint. However, there are few algorithms focusing on crowd
counting on the drone-captured data due to the lack of comprehensive datasets.
To this end, we collect a large-scale dataset and organize the Vision Meets
Drone Crowd Counting Challenge (VisDrone-CC2020) in conjunction with the 16th
European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV 2020) to promote the developments
in the related fields. The collected dataset is formed by $3,360$ images,
including $2,460$ images for training, and $900$ images for testing.
Specifically, we manually annotate persons with points in each video frame.
There are $14$ algorithms from $15$ institutes submitted to the VisDrone-CC2020
Challenge. We provide a detailed analysis of the evaluation results and
conclude the challenge. More information can be found at the website:

images for detecting skin defects and abnormalities. However, current deep
learning solutions for dermatological lesion analysis are typically limited in
providing probabilistic predictions which highlights the importance of
concerning uncertainties. This concept of uncertainty can provide a confidence
level for each feature which prevents overconfident predictions with poor
generalization on unseen data. In this paper, we propose an overall framework
that jointly considers dermatological classification and uncertainty estimation
together. The estimated confidence of each feature to avoid uncertain feature
and undesirable shift, which are caused by environmental difference of input
image, in the latent space is pooled from confidence network. Our qualitative
results show that modeling uncertainties not only helps to quantify model
confidence for each prediction but also helps classification layers to focus on
confident features, therefore, improving the accuracy for dermatological lesion
classification. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach in two
state-of-the-art dermoscopic datasets (ISIC 2018 and ISIC 2019).]]></summary>

for its predictions, is expected to accelerate the use of deep neural networks
in the real world like Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) that returns
predictions on queried data with the trained model. Deep neural networks
deployed in MLaaS face the threat of model extraction attacks. A model
extraction attack is an attack to violate intellectual property and privacy in
which an adversary steals trained models in a cloud using only their
predictions. In particular, a data-free model extraction attack has been
proposed recently and is more critical. In this attack, an adversary uses a
generative model instead of preparing input data. The feasibility of this
attack, however, needs to be studied since it requires more queries than that
with surrogate datasets. In this paper, we propose MEGEX, a data-free model
extraction attack against a gradient-based explainable AI. In this method, an
adversary uses the explanations to train the generative model and reduces the
number of queries to steal the model. Our experiments show that our proposed
method reconstructs high-accuracy models -- 0.97$\times$ and 0.98$\times$ the
victim model accuracy on SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets given 2M and 20M queries,
respectively. This implies that there is a trade-off between the
interpretability of models and the difficulty of stealing them.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When controllers (brains) and morphologies (bodies) of robots simultaneously
evolve, this can lead to a problem, namely the brain & body mismatch problem.
In this research, we propose a solution of lifetime learning. We set up a
system where modular robots can create offspring that inherit the bodies of
parents by recombination and mutation. With regards to the brains of the
offspring, we use two methods to create them. The first one entails solely
evolution which means the brain of a robot child is inherited from its parents.
The second approach is evolution plus learning which means the brain of a child
is inherited as well, but additionally is developed by a learning algorithm -
RevDEknn. We compare these two methods by running experiments in a simulator
called Revolve and use efficiency, efficacy, and the morphology intelligence of
the robots for the comparison. The experiments show that the evolution plus
learning method does not only lead to a higher fitness level, but also to more
morphologically evolving robots. This constitutes a quantitative demonstration
that changes in the brain can induce changes in the body, leading to the
concept of morphological intelligence, which is quantified by the learning
delta, meaning the ability of a morphology to facilitate learning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although deep learning has demonstrated astonishing performance in many
applications, there are still concerns on their dependability. One desirable
property of deep learning applications with societal impact is fairness (i.e.,
non-discrimination). Unfortunately, discrimination might be intrinsically
embedded into the models due to discrimination in the training data. As a
countermeasure, fairness testing systemically identifies discriminative
samples, which can be used to retrain the model and improve its fairness.
Existing fairness testing approaches however have two major limitations. First,
they only work well on traditional machine learning models and have poor
performance (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency) on deep learning models.
Second, they only work on simple tabular data and are not applicable for
domains such as text. In this work, we bridge the gap by proposing a scalable
and effective approach for systematically searching for discriminative samples
while extending fairness testing to address a challenging domain, i.e., text
classification. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach only
employs lightweight procedures like gradient computation and clustering, which
makes it significantly more scalable. Experimental results show that on
average, our approach explores the search space more effectively (9.62 and 2.38
times more than the state-of-art methods respectively on tabular and text
datasets) and generates much more individual discriminatory instances (24.95
and 2.68 times) within reasonable time. The retrained models reduce
discrimination by 57.2% and 60.2% respectively on average.]]></summary>

underlying latent factors of variation as well as the mechanism through which
each factor acts in the world. In this paper, we test whether 17 unsupervised,
weakly supervised, and fully supervised representation learning approaches
correctly infer the generative factors of variation in simple datasets
(dSprites, Shapes3D, MPI3D). In contrast to prior robustness work that
introduces novel factors of variation during test time, such as blur or other
(un)structured noise, we here recompose, interpolate, or extrapolate only
existing factors of variation from the training data set (e.g., small and
medium-sized objects during training and large objects during testing). Models
that learn the correct mechanism should be able to generalize to this
benchmark. In total, we train and test 2000+ models and observe that all of
them struggle to learn the underlying mechanism regardless of supervision
signal and architectural bias. Moreover, the generalization capabilities of all
tested models drop significantly as we move from artificial datasets towards
more realistic real-world datasets. Despite their inability to identify the
correct mechanism, the models are quite modular as their ability to infer other
in-distribution factors remains fairly stable, providing only a single factor
is out-of-distribution. These results point to an important yet understudied
problem of learning mechanistic models of observations that can facilitate

optimization that are based on an analogy to non-smooth dynamical systems. Two
distinctive features of our approach are that (i) projections or optimizations
over the entire feasible set are avoided, in stark contrast to projected
gradient methods or the Frank-Wolfe method, and (ii) iterates are allowed to
become infeasible, which differs from active set or feasible direction methods,
where the descent motion stops as soon as a new constraint is encountered. The
resulting algorithmic procedure is simple to implement even when constraints
are nonlinear, and is suitable for large-scale constrained optimization
problems in which the feasible set fails to have a simple structure. The key
underlying idea is that constraints are expressed in terms of velocities
instead of positions, which has the algorithmic consequence that optimizations
over feasible sets at each iteration are replaced with optimizations over
local, sparse convex approximations. The result is a simplified suite of
algorithms and an expanded range of possible applications in machine learning.]]></summary>

edge to collaboratively train a shared machine learning model, while keeping
all the raw training samples on device. This decentralized training approach is
demonstrated as a practical solution to mitigate the risk of privacy leakage.
However, enabling efficient FL deployment at the edge is challenging because of
non-IID training data distribution, wide system heterogeneity and
stochastic-varying runtime effects in the field. This paper jointly optimizes
time-to-convergence and energy efficiency of state-of-the-art FL use cases by
taking into account the stochastic nature of edge execution. We propose AutoFL
by tailor-designing a reinforcement learning algorithm that learns and
determines which K participant devices and per-device execution targets for
each FL model aggregation round in the presence of stochastic runtime variance,
system and data heterogeneity. By considering the unique characteristics of FL
edge deployment judiciously, AutoFL achieves 3.6 times faster model convergence
time and 4.7 and 5.2 times higher energy efficiency for local clients and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Machine learning has recently demonstrated impressive progress in predictive
accuracy across a wide array of tasks. Most ML approaches focus on
generalization performance on unseen data that are similar to the training data
(In-Distribution, or IND). However, real world applications and deployments of
ML rarely enjoy the comfort of encountering examples that are always IND. In
such situations, most ML models commonly display erratic behavior on
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) examples, such as assigning high confidence to wrong
predictions, or vice-versa. Implications of such unusual model behavior are
further exacerbated in the healthcare setting, where patient health can
potentially be put at risk. It is crucial to study the behavior and robustness
properties of models under distributional shift, understand common failure
modes, and take mitigation steps before the model is deployed. Having a
benchmark that shines light upon these aspects of a model is a first and
necessary step in addressing the issue. Recent work and interest in increasing
model robustness in OOD settings have focused more on image modality, while the
Electronic Health Record (EHR) modality is still largely under-explored. We aim
to bridge this gap by releasing BEDS-Bench, a benchmark for quantifying the
behavior of ML models over EHR data under OOD settings. We use two open access,
de-identified EHR datasets to construct several OOD data settings to run tests
on, and measure relevant metrics that characterize crucial aspects of a model's
OOD behavior. We evaluate several learning algorithms under BEDS-Bench and find
that all of them show poor generalization performance under distributional
shift in general. Our results highlight the need and the potential to improve
robustness of EHR models under distributional shift, and BEDS-Bench provides
one way to measure progress towards that goal.]]></summary>

a pervasive technology adopted in almost every aspect of computing. ML-powered
products are now embedded in our digital lives: from recommendations of what to
watch, to divining our search intent, to powering virtual assistants in
consumer and enterprise settings. Recent successes in applying ML in natural
sciences revealed that ML can be used to tackle some of the hardest real-world
problems humanity faces today. For these reasons ML has become central in the
strategy of tech companies and has gathered even more attention from academia
than ever before. Despite these successes, what we have witnessed so far is
just the beginning. Right now the people training and using ML models are
expert developers working within large organizations, but we believe the next
wave of ML systems will allow a larger amount of people, potentially without
coding skills, to perform the same tasks. These new ML systems will not require
users to fully understand all the details of how models are trained and
utilized for obtaining predictions. Declarative interfaces are well suited for
this goal, by hiding complexity and favouring separation of interests, and can
lead to increased productivity. We worked on such abstract interfaces by
developing two declarative ML systems, Overton and Ludwig, that require users
to declare only their data schema (names and types of inputs) and tasks rather
then writing low level ML code. In this article we will describe how ML systems
are currently structured, highlight important factors for their success and
adoption, what are the issues current ML systems are facing and how the systems
we developed addressed them. Finally we will talk about learnings from the
development of ML systems throughout the years and how we believe the next
generation of ML systems will look like.]]></summary>

collaboratively build a learning model iteratively through interactions with a
server from whom we need privacy. Motivated by stochastic optimization and the
federated learning (FL) paradigm, we focus on the case where a small fraction
of data samples are randomly sub-sampled in each round to participate in the
learning process, which also enables privacy amplification. To obtain even
stronger local privacy guarantees, we study this in the shuffle privacy model,
where each client randomizes its response using a local differentially private
(LDP) mechanism and the server only receives a random permutation (shuffle) of
the clients' responses without their association to each client. The principal
result of this paper is a privacy-optimization performance trade-off for
discrete randomization mechanisms in this sub-sampled shuffle privacy model.
This is enabled through a new theoretical technique to analyze the Renyi
Differential Privacy (RDP) of the sub-sampled shuffle model. We numerically
demonstrate that, for important regimes, with composition our bound yields
significant improvement in privacy guarantee over the state-of-the-art
approximate Differential Privacy (DP) guarantee (with strong composition) for
sub-sampled shuffled models. We also demonstrate numerically significant
improvement in privacy-learning performance operating point using real data

doing so suffers from the intractability of inference. As a step towards
tractable causal models, we consider the problem of learning interventional

gate functions, e.g., neural networks. Providing an arbitrarily intervened
causal graph as input, effectively subsuming Pearl's do-operator, the gate
function predicts the parameters of the SPN. The resulting interventional SPNs
are motivated and illustrated by a structural causal model themed around
personal health. Our empirical evaluation on three benchmark data sets as well

indeed are both expressive in modelling and flexible in adapting to the

Bayesian machine learning applications. Often, this requires to meaningfully
attribute predictive uncertainties to source features in an image, text or
categorical array. However, popular attribution methods are particularly
designed for classification and regression scores. In order to explain
uncertainties, state of the art alternatives commonly procure counterfactual
feature vectors, and proceed by making direct comparisons. In this paper, we
leverage path integrals to attribute uncertainties in Bayesian differentiable
models. We present a novel algorithm that relies on in-distribution curves
connecting a feature vector to some counterfactual counterpart, and we retain
desirable properties of interpretability methods. We validate our approach on
benchmark image data sets with varying resolution, and show that it
significantly simplifies interpretability over the existing alternatives.]]></summary>

and aims to measure the strength of the causal relationship, is of great
importance in many fields but is a challenging problem in practice. As present,
data-driven causal effect estimation faces two main challenges, i.e., selection
bias and the missing of counterfactual. To address these two issues, most of
the existing approaches tend to reduce the selection bias by learning a
balanced representation, and then to estimate the counterfactual through the
representation. However, they heavily rely on the finely hand-crafted metric
functions when learning balanced representations, which generally doesn't work
well for the situations where the original distribution is complicated. In this
paper, we propose a CETransformer model for casual effect estimation via
transformer based representation learning. To learn the representation of
covariates(features) robustly, a self-supervised transformer is proposed, by
which the correlation between covariates can be well exploited through
self-attention mechanism. In addition, an adversarial network is adopted to
balance the distribution of the treated and control groups in the
representation space. Experimental results on three real-world datasets
demonstrate the advantages of the proposed CETransformer, compared with the
state-of-the-art treatment effect estimation methods.]]></summary>

representation of graph-structured data. Recent work demonstrates that
transferring knowledge from self-supervised tasks to downstream tasks could
further improve graph representation. However, there is an inherent gap between
self-supervised tasks and downstream tasks in terms of optimization objective
and training data. Conventional pre-training methods may be not effective
enough on knowledge transfer since they do not make any adaptation for
downstream tasks. To solve such problems, we propose a new transfer learning
paradigm on GNNs which could effectively leverage self-supervised tasks as
auxiliary tasks to help the target task. Our methods would adaptively select
and combine different auxiliary tasks with the target task in the fine-tuning
stage. We design an adaptive auxiliary loss weighting model to learn the
weights of auxiliary tasks by quantifying the consistency between auxiliary
tasks and the target task. In addition, we learn the weighting model through
meta-learning. Our methods can be applied to various transfer learning
approaches, it performs well not only in multi-task learning but also in
pre-training and fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on multiple downstream
tasks demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively combine auxiliary

reduce the message enrichment explosion. Extensive experiments demonstrated
that the proposed model obtained superior performances (around 4$\%$ on

Wafer map pattern classification is a typical way of quality assurance. The
defect pattern on the wafer map can tell us which process has a problem. Most

methods. The supervised methods tend to have high performance, but they require
extensive labor and expert knowledge to produce labeled datasets with a

iteration, remains a major impediment for learning behaviors through deep
reinforcement learning. In contrast, providing visual demonstrations of desired
behaviors often presents an easier and more natural way to teach agents. We
consider a setting where an agent is provided a fixed dataset of visual
demonstrations illustrating how to perform a task, and must learn to solve the
task using the provided demonstrations and unsupervised environment
interactions. This setting presents a number of challenges including
representation learning for visual observations, sample complexity due to high
dimensional spaces, and learning instability due to the lack of a fixed reward
or learning signal. Towards addressing these challenges, we develop a
variational model-based adversarial imitation learning (V-MAIL) algorithm. The
model-based approach provides a strong signal for representation learning,
enables sample efficiency, and improves the stability of adversarial training
by enabling on-policy learning. Through experiments involving several
vision-based locomotion and manipulation tasks, we find that V-MAIL learns
successful visuomotor policies in a sample-efficient manner, has better
stability compared to prior work, and also achieves higher asymptotic
performance. We further find that by transferring the learned models, V-MAIL
can learn new tasks from visual demonstrations without any additional

representation of graph-structured data and achieved better task performance
than conventional methods. The foundation of GNNs is the message passing
procedure, which propagates the information in a node to its neighbors. Since
this procedure proceeds one step per layer, the range of the information
propagation among nodes is small in the lower layers, and it expands toward the
higher layers. Therefore, a GNN model has to be deep enough to capture global
structural information in a graph. On the other hand, it is known that deep GNN
models suffer from performance degradation because they lose nodes' local
information, which would be essential for good model performance, through many
message passing steps. In this study, we propose a multi-level attention
pooling (MLAP) for graph-level classification tasks, which can adapt to both
local and global structural information in a graph. It has an attention pooling
layer for each message passing step and computes the final graph representation
by unifying the layer-wise graph representations. The MLAP architecture allows
models to utilize the structural information of graphs with multiple levels of
localities because it preserves layer-wise information before losing them due
to oversmoothing. Results of our experiments show that the MLAP architecture
improves deeper models' performance in graph classification tasks compared to
the baseline architectures. In addition, analyses on the layer-wise graph
representations suggest that aggregating information from multiple levels of
localities indeed has the potential to improve the discriminability of learned
graph representations.]]></summary>

years. Highly complex sequential decision making problems from game playing and
robotics have been solved with deep model-free methods. Unfortunately, the
sample complexity of model-free methods is often high. To reduce the number of
environment samples, model-based reinforcement learning creates an explicit
model of the environment dynamics. Achieving high model accuracy is a challenge
in high-dimensional problems. In recent years, a diverse landscape of
model-based methods has been introduced to improve model accuracy, using
methods such as uncertainty modeling, model-predictive control, latent models,
and end-to-end learning and planning. Some of these methods succeed in
achieving high accuracy at low sample complexity, most do so either in a
robotics or in a games context. In this paper, we survey these methods; we
explain in detail how they work and what their strengths and weaknesses are. We
conclude with a research agenda for future work to make the methods more robust
and more widely applicable to other applications.]]></summary>

theory to (a) confront the designer with a normative question about what the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Transformer architecture is widely used for machine translation tasks.
However, its resource-intensive nature makes it challenging to implement on
constrained embedded devices, particularly where available hardware resources
can vary at run-time. We propose a dynamic machine translation model that
scales the Transformer architecture based on the available resources at any
particular time. The proposed approach, 'Dynamic-HAT', uses a HAT
SuperTransformer as the backbone to search for SubTransformers with different
accuracy-latency trade-offs at design time. The optimal SubTransformers are
sampled from the SuperTransformer at run-time, depending on latency
constraints. The Dynamic-HAT is tested on the Jetson Nano and the approach uses
inherited SubTransformers sampled directly from the SuperTransformer with a
switching time of <1s. Using inherited SubTransformers results in a BLEU score
loss of <1.5% because the SubTransformer configuration is not retrained from
scratch after sampling. However, to recover this loss in performance, the
dimensions of the design space can be reduced to tailor it to a family of
target hardware. The new reduced design space results in a BLEU score increase
of approximately 1% for sub-optimal models from the original design space, with
a wide range for performance scaling between 0.356s - 1.526s for the GPU and
2.9s - 7.31s for the CPU.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nowadays fairness issues have raised great concerns in decision-making
systems. Various fairness notions have been proposed to measure the degree to
which an algorithm is unfair. In practice, there frequently exist a certain set
of variables we term as fair variables, which are pre-decision covariates such
as users' choices. The effects of fair variables are irrelevant in assessing
the fairness of the decision support algorithm. We thus define conditional
fairness as a more sound fairness metric by conditioning on the fairness
variables. Given different prior knowledge of fair variables, we demonstrate
that traditional fairness notations, such as demographic parity and equalized
odds, are special cases of our conditional fairness notations. Moreover, we
propose a Derivable Conditional Fairness Regularizer (DCFR), which can be
integrated into any decision-making model, to track the trade-off between
precision and fairness of algorithmic decision making. Specifically, an
adversarial representation based conditional independence loss is proposed in
our DCFR to measure the degree of unfairness. With extensive experiments on
three real-world datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of our conditional
fairness notation and DCFR.]]></summary>

However, this framework has two main drawbacks: (i) Wasserstein-1 (or
Earth-Mover) distance is restrictive such that WGANs cannot always fit data
geometry well; (ii) It is difficult to achieve fast training of WGANs. In this
paper, we propose a new class of \textit{Relaxed Wasserstein} (RW) distances by
generalizing Wasserstein-1 distance with Bregman cost functions. We show that
RW distances achieve nice statistical properties while not sacrificing the
computational tractability. Combined with the GANs framework, we develop
Relaxed WGANs (RWGANs) which are not only statistically flexible but can be
approximated efficiently using heuristic approaches. Experiments on real images
demonstrate that the RWGAN with Kullback-Leibler (KL) cost function outperforms
other competing approaches, e.g., WGANs, even with gradient penalty.]]></summary>

damages, and uprooting communities, ecosystems and economies. Accurate and
robust flood detection including delineating open water flood areas and
identifying flood levels can aid in disaster response and mitigation. However,
estimating flood levels remotely is of essence as physical access to flooded
areas is limited and the ability to deploy instruments in potential flood zones
can be dangerous. Aligning flood extent mapping with local topography can
provide a plan-of-action that the disaster response team can consider. Thus,
remote flood level estimation via satellites like Sentinel-1 can prove to be
remedial. The Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence (ETCI)
competition on Flood Detection tasked participants with predicting flooded
pixels after training with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images in a
supervised setting. We use a cyclical approach involving two stages (1)
training an ensemble model of multiple UNet architectures with available high
and low confidence labeled data and, (2) generating pseudo labels or low
confidence labels on the unlabeled test dataset, and then, combining the
generated labels with the previously available high confidence labeled dataset.
This assimilated dataset is used for the next round of training ensemble
models. This cyclical process is repeated until the performance improvement
plateaus. Additionally, we post process our results with Conditional Random
Fields. Our approach sets a high score on the public leaderboard for the ETCI
competition with 0.7654 IoU. Our method, which we release with all the code
including trained models, can also be used as an open science benchmark for the

(NMT) models with the pre-trained language models (LM) can speed up the model
training and boost the model performance. In this work, we identify a critical
side-effect of pre-training for NMT, which is due to the discrepancy between
the training objectives of LM-based pre-training and NMT. Since the LM
objective learns to reconstruct a few source tokens and copy most of them, the
pre-training initialization would affect the copying behaviors of NMT models.
We provide a quantitative analysis of copying behaviors by introducing a metric
called copying ratio, which empirically shows that pre-training based NMT
models have a larger copying ratio than the standard one. In response to this
problem, we propose a simple and effective method named copying penalty to
control the copying behaviors in decoding. Extensive experiments on both
in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks show that the copying penalty method
consistently improves translation performance by controlling copying behaviors
for pre-training based NMT models. Source code is freely available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With COVID-19 cases rising rapidly, deep learning has emerged as a promising
diagnosis technique. However, identifying the most accurate models to
characterize COVID-19 patients is challenging because comparing results
obtained with different types of data and acquisition processes is non-trivial.
In this paper we designed, evaluated, and compared the performance of 20
convolutional neutral networks in classifying patients as COVID-19 positive,
healthy, or suffering from other pulmonary lung infections based on Chest CT
scans, serving as the first to consider the EfficientNet family for COVID-19
diagnosis and employ intermediate activation maps for visualizing model
performance. All models are trained and evaluated in Python using 4173 Chest CT
images from the dataset entitled "A COVID multiclass dataset of CT scans," with
2168, 758, and 1247 images of patients that are COVID-19 positive, healthy, or
suffering from other pulmonary infections, respectively. EfficientNet-B5 was
identified as the best model with an F1 score of 0.9769+/-0.0046, accuracy of
0.9759+/-0.0048, sensitivity of 0.9788+/-0.0055, specificity of
0.9730+/-0.0057, and precision of 0.9751 +/- 0.0051. On an alternate 2-class
dataset, EfficientNetB5 obtained an accuracy of 0.9845+/-0.0109, F1 score of
0.9599+/-0.0251, sensitivity of 0.9682+/-0.0099, specificity of
0.9883+/-0.0150, and precision of 0.9526 +/- 0.0523. Intermediate activation
maps and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mappings offered
human-interpretable evidence of the model's perception of ground-class
opacities and consolidations, hinting towards a promising use-case of
artificial intelligence-assisted radiology tools. With a prediction speed of
under 0.1 seconds on GPUs and 0.5 seconds on CPUs, our proposed model offers a
rapid, scalable, and accurate diagnostic for COVID-19.]]></summary>

input $X$ and output $Y$. However, such paired data can be difficult to collect
in practice. In this paper, we consider the task of predicting $Y$ from $X$
when we have no paired data of them, but we have two separate, independent
datasets of $X$ and $Y$ each observed with some mediating variable $U$, that
is, we have two datasets $S_X = \{(X_i, U_i)\}$ and $S_Y = \{(U'_j, Y'_j)\}$. A
naive approach is to predict $U$ from $X$ using $S_X$ and then $Y$ from $U$
using $S_Y$, but we show that this is not statistically consistent. Moreover,
predicting $U$ can be more difficult than predicting $Y$ in practice, e.g.,
when $U$ has higher dimensionality. To circumvent the difficulty, we propose a
new method that avoids predicting $U$ but directly learns $Y = f(X)$ by
training $f(X)$ with $S_{X}$ to predict $h(U)$ which is trained with $S_{Y}$ to
approximate $Y$. We prove statistical consistency and error bounds of our
method and experimentally confirm its practical usefulness.]]></summary>

detection. A model trained with normal data generates a larger restoration
error for abnormal data. Whether or not abnormal data is determined by
observing the restoration error. It takes a lot of cost and time to obtain
abnormal data in the industrial field. Therefore the model trains only normal
data and detects abnormal data in the inference phase. However, the restoration
area for the input data of AE is limited in the latent space. To solve this
problem, we propose Multiple-hypothesis Autoencoder(MH-AE) model composed of
several decoders. MH-AE model increases the restoration area through contention
between decoders. The proposed method shows that the anomaly detection

model with very competitive generalization. However, SBL needs to invert a big
covariance matrix with complexity O(M^3 ) (M: feature size) for updating the
regularization priors, making it difficult for practical use. There are three
issues in SBL: 1) Inverting the covariance matrix may obtain singular solutions
in some cases, which hinders SBL from convergence; 2) Poor scalability to
problems with high dimensional feature space or large data size; 3) SBL easily
suffers from memory overflow for large-scale data. This paper addresses these
issues with a newly proposed diagonal Quasi-Newton (DQN) method for SBL called
DQN-SBL where the inversion of big covariance matrix is ignored so that the
complexity and memory storage are reduced to O(M). The DQN-SBL is thoroughly
evaluated on non-linear classifiers and linear feature selection using various
benchmark datasets of different sizes. Experimental results verify that DQN-SBL
receives competitive generalization with a very sparse model and scales well to
large-scale problems.]]></summary>

with independence assumption for modelling the span probability $P(a_s,a_e) =

has adverse effects. Therefore we propose multiple approaches to modelling

the compound objective is consistently superior or equal to other assumptions

demonstrating the impact of the compound objective on the real examples. Our

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Policy optimization is a widely-used method in reinforcement learning. Due to
its local-search nature, however, theoretical guarantees on global optimality
often rely on extra assumptions on the Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) that
bypass the challenge of global exploration. To eliminate the need of such
assumptions, in this work, we develop a general solution that adds dilated
bonuses to the policy update to facilitate global exploration. To showcase the
power and generality of this technique, we apply it to several episodic MDP
settings with adversarial losses and bandit feedback, improving and
generalizing the state-of-the-art. Specifically, in the tabular case, we obtain
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret where $T$ is the number of episodes,
improving the $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}({T}^{2/3})$ regret bound by Shani et al.
(2020). When the number of states is infinite, under the assumption that the
state-action values are linear in some low-dimensional features, we obtain
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}({T}^{2/3})$ regret with the help of a simulator,
matching the result of Neu and Olkhovskaya (2020) while importantly removing
the need of an exploratory policy that their algorithm requires. When a
simulator is unavailable, we further consider a linear MDP setting and obtain
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}({T}^{14/15})$ regret, which is the first result for
linear MDPs with adversarial losses and bandit feedback.]]></summary>

segmentation problem by providing full or weak-supervision through manually
annotated labels or self-supervised epoch-based training. Most works consider
videos that are at most 10's of minutes long. We present a self-supervised
perceptual prediction framework capable of temporal event segmentation by
building stable representations of objects over time and demonstrate it on long
videos, spanning several days. The approach is deceptively simple but quite
effective. We rely on predictions of high-level features computed by a standard
deep learning backbone. For prediction, we use an LSTM, augmented with an
attention mechanism, trained in a self-supervised manner using the prediction
error. The self-learned attention maps effectively localize and track the
event-related objects in each frame. The proposed approach does not require
labels. It requires only a single pass through the video, with no separate
training set. Given the lack of datasets of very long videos, we demonstrate
our method on video from 10 days (254 hours) of continuous wildlife monitoring
data that we had collected with required permissions. We find that the approach
is robust to various environmental conditions such as day/night conditions,
rain, sharp shadows, and windy conditions. For the task of temporally locating
events, we had an 80% recall rate at 20% false-positive rate for frame-level
segmentation. At the activity level, we had an 80% activity recall rate for one
false activity detection every 50 minutes. We will make the dataset, which is

pursuit (WPP), is a robust variant of the Wasserstein distance. Recent work
suggests that this quantity is more robust than the standard Wasserstein
distance, in particular when comparing probability measures in high-dimensions.
However, it is ruled out for practical application because the optimization
model is essentially non-convex and non-smooth which makes the computation
intractable. Our contribution in this paper is to revisit the original
motivation behind WPP/PRW, but take the hard route of showing that, despite its
non-convexity and lack of nonsmoothness, and even despite some hardness results
proved by~\citet{Niles-2019-Estimation} in a minimax sense, the original
formulation for PRW/WPP \textit{can} be efficiently computed in practice using
Riemannian optimization, yielding in relevant cases better behavior than its
convex relaxation. More specifically, we provide three simple algorithms with
solid theoretical guarantee on their complexity bound (one in the appendix),
and demonstrate their effectiveness and efficiency by conducing extensive
experiments on synthetic and real data. This paper provides a first step into a
computational theory of the PRW distance and provides the links between optimal
transport and Riemannian optimization.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present an information-based uncertainty quantification method for general
Markov Random Fields. Markov Random Fields (MRF) are structured, probabilistic
graphical models over undirected graphs, and provide a fundamental unifying
modeling tool for statistical mechanics, probabilistic machine learning, and
artificial intelligence. Typically MRFs are complex and high-dimensional with
nodes and edges (connections) built in a modular fashion from simpler,
low-dimensional probabilistic models and their local connections; in turn, this
modularity allows to incorporate available data to MRFs and efficiently
simulate them by leveraging their graph-theoretic structure. Learning graphical
models from data and/or constructing them from physical modeling and
constraints necessarily involves uncertainties inherited from data, modeling
choices, or numerical approximations. These uncertainties in the MRF can be
manifested either in the graph structure or the probability distribution
functions, and necessarily will propagate in predictions for quantities of
interest. Here we quantify such uncertainties using tight, information based
bounds on the predictions of quantities of interest; these bounds take
advantage of the graphical structure of MRFs and are capable of handling the
inherent high-dimensionality of such graphical models. We demonstrate our
methods in MRFs for medical diagnostics and statistical mechanics models. In
the latter, we develop uncertainty quantification bounds for finite size
effects and phase diagrams, which constitute two of the typical predictions
goals of statistical mechanics modeling.]]></summary>

important societal implication. Recently, there have been multiple attempts on
improving fairness of neural networks, with a focus on fairness testing (e.g.,
generating individual discriminatory instances) and fairness training (e.g.,
enhancing fairness through augmented training). In this work, we propose an
approach to formally verify neural networks against fairness, with a focus on
independence-based fairness such as group fairness. Our method is built upon an
approach for learning Markov Chains from a user-provided neural network (i.e.,
a feed-forward neural network or a recurrent neural network) which is
guaranteed to facilitate sound analysis. The learned Markov Chain not only
allows us to verify (with Probably Approximate Correctness guarantee) whether
the neural network is fair or not, but also facilities sensitivity analysis
which helps to understand why fairness is violated. We demonstrate that with
our analysis results, the neural weights can be optimized to improve fairness.
Our approach has been evaluated with multiple models trained on benchmark
datasets and the experiment results show that our approach is effective and
efficient.]]></summary>

(LTH) (Frankle & Carbin, 2018) pointed out that there could exist a winning
ticket (i.e., a properly pruned sub-network together with original weight
initialization) that can achieve competitive performance than the original
dense network. However, it is not easy to observe such winning property in many
scenarios, where for example, a relatively large learning rate is used even if
it benefits training the original dense model. In this work, we investigate the
underlying condition and rationale behind the winning property, and find that
the underlying reason is largely attributed to the correlation between
initialized weights and final-trained weights when the learning rate is not
sufficiently large. Thus, the existence of winning property is correlated with
an insufficient DNN pretraining, and is unlikely to occur for a well-trained
DNN. To overcome this limitation, we propose the "pruning & fine-tuning" method
that consistently outperforms lottery ticket sparse training under the same
pruning algorithm and the same total training epochs. Extensive experiments
over multiple deep models (VGG, ResNet, MobileNet-v2) on different datasets
have been conducted to justify our proposals.]]></summary>

its malignancy, it is graded by a pathologist into three grades according to
WHO standards. This grade plays a decisive role in treatment, and yet may be
subject to inter-rater discordance. In this work, we present and compare three
approaches towards fully automatic meningioma grading from histology whole
slide images. All approaches are following a two-stage paradigm, where we first
identify a region of interest based on the detection of mitotic figures in the
slide using a state-of-the-art object detection deep learning network. This
region of highest mitotic rate is considered characteristic for biological
tumor behavior. In the second stage, we calculate a score corresponding to
tumor malignancy based on information contained in this region using three
different settings. In a first approach, image patches are sampled from this
region and regression is based on morphological features encoded by a
ResNet-based network. We compare this to learning a logistic regression from
the determined mitotic count, an approach which is easily traceable and
explainable. Lastly, we combine both approaches in a single network. We trained
the pipeline on 951 slides from 341 patients and evaluated them on a separate
set of 141 slides from 43 patients. All approaches yield a high correlation to
the WHO grade. The logistic regression and the combined approach had the best
results in our experiments, yielding correct predictions in 32 and 33 of all
cases, respectively, with the image-based approach only predicting 25 cases
correctly. Spearman's correlation was 0.716, 0.792 and 0.790 respectively. It
may seem counterintuitive at first that morphological features provided by
image patches do not improve model performance. Yet, this mirrors the criteria
of the grading scheme, where mitotic count is the only unequivocal parameter.]]></summary>

In this work, we investigate approximate greedification when reducing the KL
divergence between the parameterized policy and the Boltzmann distribution over
action values. In particular, we investigate the difference between the forward
and reverse KL divergences, with varying degrees of entropy regularization. We
show that the reverse KL has stronger policy improvement guarantees, but that
reducing the forward KL can result in a worse policy. We also demonstrate,
however, that a large enough reduction of the forward KL can induce improvement
under additional assumptions. Empirically, we show on simple continuous-action
environments that the forward KL can induce more exploration, but at the cost
of a more suboptimal policy. No significant differences were observed in the
discrete-action setting or on a suite of benchmark problems. Throughout, we
highlight that many policy gradient methods can be seen as an instance of API,
with either the forward or reverse KL for the policy update, and discuss next
steps for understanding and improving our policy optimization algorithms.]]></summary>

widely used to reduce the model size and computational complexity of deep
neural network (DNN) for applications in power-constrained scenarios such as
embedded systems. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based auto-pruning has been
further proposed to automate the DNN pruning process to avoid expensive
hand-crafted work. However, the RL-based pruner involves a time-consuming
training process and the high expense of each sample further exacerbates this
problem. These impediments have greatly restricted the real-world application
of RL-based auto-pruning. Thus, in this paper, we propose an efficient
auto-pruning framework which solves this problem by taking advantage of the
historical data from the previous auto-pruning process. In our framework, we
first boost the convergence of the RL-pruner by transfer learning. Then, an
augmented transfer learning scheme is proposed to further speed up the training
process by improving the transferability. Finally, an assistant learning
process is proposed to improve the sample efficiency of the RL agent. The
experiments have shown that our framework can accelerate the auto-pruning
process by 1.5-2.5 times for ResNet20, and 1.81-2.375 times for other neural

Lykouris & Vassilvitskii [2] on learning-augmented online algorithms for
classical online optimization problems, in this work, we consider the Online
Facility Location problem under this framework. In Online Facility Location
(OFL), demands arrive one-by-one in a metric space and must be (irrevocably)
assigned to an open facility upon arrival, without any knowledge about future
demands.

We present an online algorithm for OFL that exploits potentially imperfect
predictions on the locations of the optimal facilities. We prove that the
competitive ratio decreases smoothly from sublogarithmic in the number of
demands to constant, as the error, i.e., the total distance of the predicted
locations to the optimal facility locations, decreases towards zero. We
complement our analysis with a matching lower bound establishing that the
dependence of the algorithm's competitive ratio on the error is optimal, up to
constant factors. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on real world data and
compare our learning augmented approach with the current best online algorithm
for the problem.]]></summary>

closed form expressions for the explanations output by these two methods and
show that they both converge to the same explanation in expectation, i.e., when
the number of perturbed samples used by these methods is large. We then
leverage this connection to establish other desirable properties, such as

their pace to use machine learning longitudinal motion planning (mMP) for
autonomous vehicles (AVs). This paper reviews the current state of the art in
mMP, with an exclusive focus on its impact on traffic congestion. We identify
the availability of congestion scenarios in current datasets, and summarize the
required features for training mMP. For learning methods, we survey the major
methods in both imitation learning and non-imitation learning. We also
highlight the emerging technologies adopted by some leading AV companies, e.g.
Tesla, Waymo, and Comma.ai. We find that: i) the AV industry has been mostly
focusing on the long tail problem related to safety and overlooked the impact
on traffic congestion, ii) the current public self-driving datasets have not
included enough congestion scenarios, and mostly lack the necessary input
features/output labels to train mMP, and iii) albeit reinforcement learning
(RL) approach can integrate congestion mitigation into the learning goal, the
major mMP method adopted by industry is still behavior cloning (BC), whose
capability to learn a congestion-mitigating mMP remains to be seen. Based on
the review, the study identifies the research gaps in current mMP development.
Some suggestions towards congestion mitigation for future mMP studies are
proposed: i) enrich data collection to facilitate the congestion learning, ii)
incorporate non-imitation learning methods to combine traffic efficiency into a
safety-oriented technical route, and iii) integrate domain knowledge from the
traditional car following (CF) theory to improve the string stability of mMP.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here, we introduce a fully local index named "sensitivity" for each neuron to
control chaoticity or gradient globally in a neural network (NN). We also
propose a learning method to adjust it named "sensitivity adjustment learning
(SAL)". The index is the gradient magnitude of its output with respect to its
inputs. By adjusting its time average to 1.0 in each neuron, information
transmission in the neuron changes to be moderate without shrinking or
expanding for both forward and backward computations. That results in moderate
information transmission through a layer of neurons when the weights and inputs
are random. Therefore, SAL can control the chaoticity of the network dynamics
in a recurrent NN (RNN). It can also solve the vanishing gradient problem in
error backpropagation (BP) learning in a deep feedforward NN or an RNN. We
demonstrate that when applying SAL to an RNN with small and random initial
weights, log-sensitivity, which is the logarithm of RMS (root mean square)
sensitivity over all the neurons, is equivalent to the maximum Lyapunov
exponent until it reaches 0.0. We also show that SAL works with BP or BPTT (BP
through time) to avoid the vanishing gradient problem in a 300-layer NN or an
RNN that learns a problem with a lag of 300 steps between the first input and
the output. Compared with manually fine-tuning the spectral radius of the
weight matrix before learning, SAL's continuous nonlinear learning nature
prevents loss of sensitivities during learning, resulting in a significant
improvement in learning performance.]]></summary>

approach to robot manipulation of novel objects ab initio, without prior object
models or pre-training on a large object data set. The key element of Prompt is
a particle-based object representation, in which each particle represents a
point in the object, the local geometric, physical, and other features of the
point, and also its relation with other particles. Like the model-based
analytic approaches to manipulation, the particle representation enables the
robot to reason about the object's geometry and dynamics in order to choose
suitable manipulation actions. Like the data-driven approaches, the particle
representation is learned online in real-time from visual sensor input,
specifically, multi-view RGB images. The particle representation thus connects
visual perception with robot control. Prompt combines the benefits of both
model-based reasoning and data-driven learning. We show empirically that Prompt
successfully handles a variety of everyday objects, some of which are
transparent. It handles various manipulation tasks, including grasping,
pushing, etc,. Our experiments also show that Prompt outperforms a
state-of-the-art data-driven grasping method on the daily objects, even though
it does not use any offline training data.]]></summary>

classification and bounding-box regression. Generally, they select the
bounding-box with maximum classification confidence as the final prediction.
This strategy may miss the right result due to the accuracy misalignment
between classification and regression. In this paper, we propose a novel
siamese tracking algorithm called SiamRCR, addressing this problem with a
simple, light and effective solution. It builds reciprocal links between
classification and regression branches, which can dynamically re-weight their
losses for each positive sample. In addition, we add a localization branch to
predict the localization accuracy, so that it can work as the replacement of
the regression assistance link during inference. This branch makes the training
and inference more consistent. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of SiamRCR and its superiority over the state-of-the-art
competitors on GOT-10k, LaSOT, TrackingNet, OTB-2015, VOT-2018 and VOT-2019.

being non-invasive, unobtrusive, not requiring cooperation and being less
likely to be obscured compared to other biometrics. Existing methods for gait
recognition require cooperative gait scenarios, in which a single person is
walking multiple times in a straight line in front of a camera. We aim to
address the hard challenges of real-world scenarios in which camera feeds
capture multiple people, who in most cases pass in front of the camera only
once. We address privacy concerns by using only the motion information of
walking individuals, with no identifiable appearance-based information. As
such, we propose a novel weakly supervised learning framework, WildGait, which
consists of training a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network on a large
number of automatically annotated skeleton sequences obtained from raw,
real-world, surveillance streams to learn useful gait signatures. Our results
show that, with fine-tuning, we surpass in terms of recognition accuracy the
current state-of-the-art pose-based gait recognition solutions. Our proposed
method is reliable in training gait recognition methods in unconstrained
environments, especially in settings with scarce amounts of annotated data.]]></summary>

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as the responsibility to process an
adequate, relevant, and limited amount of personal data in relation to a
processing purpose. However, unlike fairness or transparency, the principle has
not seen wide adoption for machine learning systems due to a lack of
computational interpretation. In this paper, we build on literature in machine
learning and law to propose the first learning framework for limiting data
collection based on an interpretation that ties the data collection purpose to
system performance. We formalize a data minimization criterion based on
performance curve derivatives and provide an effective and interpretable
piecewise power law technique that models distinct stages of an algorithm's
performance throughout data collection. Results from our empirical
investigation offer deeper insights into the relevant considerations when
designing a data minimization framework, including the choice of feature
acquisition algorithm, initialization conditions, as well as impacts on

obtain nearly-optimal bounds for various problems such as rank computation,
finding a maximal linearly independent subset of columns, regression, low rank
approximation, maximum matching on general graphs and linear matroid union, one
would need to resolve the main open question of Nelson and Nguyen (FOCS, 2013)
regarding the logarithmic factors in the sketching dimension for existing
constant factor approximation oblivious subspace embeddings. We show how to
bypass this question using a refined sketching technique, and obtain optimal or
nearly optimal bounds for these problems. A key technique we use is an explicit
mapping of Indyk based on uncertainty principles and extractors, which after
first applying known oblivious subspace embeddings, allows us to quickly spread
out the mass of the vector so that sampling is now effective, and we avoid a
logarithmic factor that is standard in the sketching dimension resulting from
matrix Chernoff bounds. For the fundamental problems of rank computation and
finding a linearly independent subset of columns, our algorithms improve
Cheung, Kwok, and Lau (JACM, 2013) and are optimal to within a constant factor
and a $\log\log(n)$-factor, respectively. Further, for constant factor
regression and low rank approximation we give the first optimal algorithms, for

ability when trained on large pixel-wise annotated image datasets. It remains a
major challenge however to aggregate such datasets, as the time and monetary
cost associated with collecting extensive annotations is extremely high. This
is particularly the case for generating precise pixel-wise annotations in video
and volumetric image data. To this end, this work presents a novel framework to
produce pixel-wise segmentations using minimal supervision. Our method relies
on 2D point supervision, whereby a single 2D location within an object of
interest is provided on each image of the data. Our method then estimates the
object appearance in a semi-supervised fashion by learning
object-image-specific features and by using these in a semi-supervised learning
framework. Our object model is then used in a graph-based optimization problem
that takes into account all provided locations and the image data in order to
infer the complete pixel-wise segmentation. In practice, we solve this
optimally as a tracking problem using a K-shortest path approach. Both the
object model and segmentation are then refined iteratively to further improve
the final segmentation. We show that by collecting 2D locations using a gaze
tracker, our approach can provide state-of-the-art segmentations on a range of
objects and image modalities (video and 3D volumes), and that these can then be
used to train supervised machine learning classifiers.]]></summary>

requirements (e.g., collecting outlier data and hyperparameter validation) and
produce side effects (classification accuracy drop and slow/inefficient
inferences). Recently, entropic out-of-distribution detection has been proposed
as a seamless approach (i.e., a solution that avoids all the previously
mentioned drawbacks). The entropic out-of-distribution detection solution
comprises the IsoMax loss for training and the entropic score for
out-of-distribution detection. The IsoMax loss works as a SoftMax loss drop-in
replacement because swapping the SoftMax loss with the IsoMax loss requires no
changes in the model's architecture or training procedures/hyperparameters. In
this paper, we propose to perform what we call an isometrization of the
distances used in the IsoMax loss. Additionally, we propose to replace the
entropic score with the minimum distance score. Our experiments showed that
these simple modifications increase out-of-distribution detection performance
while keeping the solution seamless. Code available at

robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. However, existing methods assume
that training and testing data are from the same domain, which suffers from
severe performance degradation when a domain gap exists, such as the simulator
and real robot. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised domain
adaptation framework which can simultaneously transfer multi-modality
knowledge, i.e., both kinematic and visual data, from simulator to real robot.
It remedies the domain gap with enhanced transferable features by using
temporal cues in videos, and inherent correlations in multi-modal towards
recognizing gesture. Specifically, we first propose an MDO-K to align
kinematics, which exploits temporal continuity to transfer motion directions
with smaller gap rather than position values, relieving the adaptation burden.
Moreover, we propose a KV-Relation-ATT to transfer the co-occurrence signals of
kinematics and vision. Such features attended by correlation similarity are
more informative for enhancing domain-invariance of the model. Two feature
alignment strategies benefit the model mutually during the end-to-end learning
process. We extensively evaluate our method for gesture recognition using DESK
dataset with peg transfer procedure. Results show that our approach recovers
the performance with great improvement gains, up to 12.91% in ACC and 20.16% in
F1score without using any annotations in real robot.]]></summary>

environment requires a superior potential controller such as hierarchical
reinforcement learning (HRL) rather than an atomic RL because it absorbs the
complexity of commands to achieve the purpose of the task in its hierarchical
structure. One of the HRL issues is how to train each level policy with the
optimal data collection from its experience. That is to say, how to synchronize
adjacent level policies optimally. Our research finds that a HRL model through
the off-policy correction technique of HRL, which trains a higher-level policy
with the goal of reflecting a lower-level policy which is newly trained using
the off-policy method, takes the critical role of synchronizing both level
policies at all times while they are being trained. We propose a novel HRL
model supporting the optimal level synchronization using the off-policy
correction technique with a deep generative model. This uses the advantage of
the inverse operation of a flow-based deep generative model (FDGM) to achieve
the goal corresponding to the current state of the lower-level policy. The
proposed model also considers the freedom of the goal dimension between HRL
policies which makes it the generalized inverse model of the model-free RL in
HRL with the optimal synchronization method. The comparative experiment results

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recurrence data arise from multi-disciplinary domains spanning reliability,
cyber security, healthcare, online retailing, etc. This paper investigates an
additive-tree-based approach, known as Boost-R (Boosting for Recurrence Data),
for recurrent event data with both static and dynamic features. Boost-R
constructs an ensemble of gradient boosted additive trees to estimate the
cumulative intensity function of the recurrent event process, where a new tree
is added to the ensemble by minimizing the regularized L2 distance between the
observed and predicted cumulative intensity. Unlike conventional regression
trees, a time-dependent function is constructed by Boost-R on each tree leaf.
The sum of these functions, from multiple trees, yields the ensemble estimator
of the cumulative intensity. The divide-and-conquer nature of tree-based
methods is appealing when hidden sub-populations exist within a heterogeneous
population. The non-parametric nature of regression trees helps to avoid
parametric assumptions on the complex interactions between event processes and
features. Critical insights and advantages of Boost-R are investigated through
comprehensive numerical examples. Datasets and computer code of Boost-R are
made available on GitHub. To our best knowledge, Boost-R is the first gradient
boosted additive-tree-based approach for modeling large-scale recurrent event
data with both static and dynamic feature information.]]></summary>

from medical images are important, especially in the diagnosis and treatment
management for patients suffering from myocardial infarction (MI). Late
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) provides an
important protocol to visualize MI. However, automated segmentation of LGE CMR
is still challenging, due to the indistinguishable boundaries, heterogeneous
intensity distribution and complex enhancement patterns of pathological
myocardium from LGE CMR. Furthermore, compared with the other sequences LGE CMR
images with gold standard labels are particularly limited, which represents
another obstacle for developing novel algorithms for automatic segmentation of
LGE CMR. This paper presents the selective results from the Multi-Sequence
Cardiac MR (MS-CMR) Segmentation challenge, in conjunction with MICCAI 2019.
The challenge offered a data set of paired MS-CMR images, including auxiliary
CMR sequences as well as LGE CMR, from 45 patients who underwent
cardiomyopathy. It was aimed to develop new algorithms, as well as benchmark
existing ones for LGE CMR segmentation and compare them objectively. In
addition, the paired MS-CMR images could enable algorithms to combine the
complementary information from the other sequences for the segmentation of LGE
CMR. Nine representative works were selected for evaluation and comparisons,
among which three methods are unsupervised methods and the other six are
supervised. The results showed that the average performance of the nine methods
was comparable to the inter-observer variations. The success of these methods
was mainly attributed to the inclusion of the auxiliary sequences from the
MS-CMR images, which provide important label information for the training of
deep neural networks.]]></summary>

centroids from microscopy images. Recently, convolutional neural network-based
approaches have achieved promising performance. However, these methods require
a certain amount of annotation for each imaging condition. This annotation is a
time-consuming and labor-intensive task. To overcome this problem, we propose a
semi-supervised cell-detection method that effectively uses a time-lapse
sequence with one labeled image and the other images unlabeled. First, we train
a cell-detection network with a one-labeled image and estimate the unlabeled
images with the trained network. We then select high-confidence positions from
the estimations by tracking the detected cells from the labeled frame to those
far from it. Next, we generate pseudo-labels from the tracking results and
train the network by using pseudo-labels. We evaluated our method for seven
conditions of public datasets, and we achieved the best results relative to
other semi-supervised methods. Our code is available at

estimate exact locations of human heads in the given crowded videos. To model
spatial-temporal dependencies of human mobility, we propose a multi-focus

correspondences while maintaining the spatial topological structure of the

human heads well using the equipped multi-focus mechanism. Based on the
multi-focus GNA, we develop a unified neural network called GNANet to
accurately locate head centers in video clips by fully aggregating
spatial-temporal information via a scene modeling module and a context
cross-attention module. Moreover, to facilitate future researches in this
field, we introduce a large-scale crowded video benchmark named SenseCrowd,
which consists of 60K+ frames captured in various surveillance scenarios and
2M+ head annotations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three

Aware Embedding Network (TAEN) for few-shot action recognition, that learns to
represent actions, in a metric space as a trajectory, conveying both short term
semantics and longer term connectivity between action parts. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of TAEN on two few shot tasks, video classification and temporal
action detection and evaluate our method on the Kinetics-400 and on ActivityNet

critical role in many practical applications, such as urban planning,
environmental protection, natural and anthropogenic landscape monitoring, etc.
However, the automation of semantic segmentation, i.e., automatic
categorization/labeling and segmentation is still a challenging task,
particularly for fine-resolution images with huge spatial and spectral
complexity. Addressing such a problem represents an exciting research field,
which paves the way for scene-level landscape pattern analysis and decision
making. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatic land segmentation
based on the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). As a classic architecture, FPN can
build a feature pyramid with high-level semantics throughout. However,
intrinsic defects in feature extraction and fusion hinder FPN from further
aggregating more discriminative features. Hence, we propose an Attention
Aggregation Module (AAM) to enhance multi-scale feature learning through
attention-guided feature aggregation. Based on FPN and AAM, a novel framework
named Attention Aggregation Feature Pyramid Network (A2-FPN) is developed for
semantic segmentation of fine-resolution remotely sensed images. Extensive
experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our A2
-FPN in segmentation accuracy. Code is available at

In this paper we designed, evaluated, and compared the performance of 20
convolutional neutral networks in classifying patients as COVID-19 positive,
healthy, or suffering from other pulmonary lung infections based on Chest CT
scans, serving as the first to consider the EfficientNet family for COVID-19
diagnosis and employ intermediate activation maps for visualizing model
performance. All models are trained and evaluated in Python using 4173 Chest CT
images from the dataset entitled "A COVID multiclass dataset of CT scans," with
2168, 758, and 1247 images of patients that are COVID-19 positive, healthy, or
suffering from other pulmonary infections, respectively. EfficientNet-B5 was
identified as the best model with an F1 score of 0.9769+/-0.0046, accuracy of
0.9759+/-0.0048, sensitivity of 0.9788+/-0.0055, specificity of

maps and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mappings offered
human-interpretable evidence of the model's perception of ground-class
opacities and consolidations, hinting towards a promising use-case of
artificial intelligence-assisted radiology tools. With a prediction speed of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The current standard for a variety of computer vision tasks using smaller
numbers of labelled training examples is to fine-tune from weights pre-trained
on a large image classification dataset such as ImageNet. The application of
transfer learning and transfer learning methods tends to be rigidly binary. A
model is either pre-trained or not pre-trained. Pre-training a model either
increases performance or decreases it, the latter being defined as negative
transfer. Application of L2-SP regularisation that decays the weights towards
their pre-trained values is either applied or all weights are decayed towards
0. This paper re-examines these assumptions. Our recommendations are based on
extensive empirical evaluation that demonstrate the application of a non-binary
approach to achieve optimal results. (1) Achieving best performance on each
individual dataset requires careful adjustment of various transfer learning
hyperparameters not usually considered, including number of layers to transfer,
different learning rates for different layers and different combinations of
L2SP and L2 regularization. (2) Best practice can be achieved using a number of
measures of how well the pre-trained weights fit the target dataset to guide
optimal hyperparameters. We present methods for non-binary transfer learning
including combining L2SP and L2 regularization and performing non-traditional
fine-tuning hyperparameter searches. Finally we suggest heuristics for
determining the optimal transfer learning hyperparameters. The benefits of
using a non-binary approach are supported by final results that come close to
or exceed state of the art performance on a variety of tasks that have
traditionally been more difficult for transfer learning.]]></summary>

techniques have been applied, achieving extremely high accuracies and preparing
highly robust FER systems still remains a challenge due to heterogeneous
details in human faces. In this paper, we will be deep diving into implementing
a system for recognition of facial expressions (FER) by leveraging neural
networks, and more specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We adopt
the fundamental concepts of deep learning and computer vision with various
architectures, fine-tune it's hyperparameters and experiment with various
optimization methods and demonstrate a state-of-the-art single-network-accuracy
of 70.10% on the FER2013 dataset without using any additional training data.]]></summary>

space which makes it very difficult to independently control a specific
attribute without affecting the others. Supervised attribute editing requires
annotated training data which is difficult to obtain and limits the editable
attributes to those with labels. Therefore, unsupervised attribute editing in
an disentangled latent space is key to performing neat and versatile semantic
face editing. In this paper, we present a new technique termed
Structure-Texture Independent Architecture with Weight Decomposition and
Orthogonal Regularization (STIA-WO) to disentangle the latent space for
unsupervised semantic face editing. By applying STIA-WO to GAN, we have
developed a StyleGAN termed STGAN-WO which performs weight decomposition
through utilizing the style vector to construct a fully controllable weight
matrix to regulate image synthesis, and employs orthogonal regularization to
ensure each entry of the style vector only controls one independent feature
matrix. To further disentangle the facial attributes, STGAN-WO introduces a
structure-texture independent architecture which utilizes two independently and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) latent vectors to control the synthesis of the
texture and structure components in a disentangled way. Unsupervised semantic
editing is achieved by moving the latent code in the coarse layers along its
orthogonal directions to change texture related attributes or changing the
latent code in the fine layers to manipulate structure related ones. We present
experimental results which show that our new STGAN-WO can achieve better
attribute editing than state of the art methods.]]></summary>

collects and implements a wide range of popular deep learning-based methods for
face recognition. First of all, face.evoLVe is composed of key components that
cover the full process of face analytics, including face alignment, data
processing, various backbones, losses, and alternatives with bags of tricks for
improving performance. Later, face.evoLVe supports multi-GPU training on top of
different deep learning platforms, such as PyTorch and PaddlePaddle, which
facilitates researchers to work on both large-scale datasets with millions of
images and low-shot counterparts with limited well-annotated data. More
importantly, along with face.evoLVe, images before & after alignment in the
common benchmark datasets are released with source codes and trained models
provided. All these efforts lower the technical burdens in reproducing the
existing methods for comparison, while users of our library could focus on
developing advanced approaches more efficiently. Last but not least,
face.evoLVe is well designed and vibrantly evolving, so that new face
recognition approaches can be easily plugged into our framework. Note that we
have used face.evoLVe to participate in a number of face recognition
competitions and secured the first place. The version that supports PyTorch is
publicly available at https://github.com/ZhaoJ9014/face.evoLVe.PyTorch and the
PaddlePaddle version is available at

matching generative adversarial network (PSIGAN) for unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) and multi-organ segmentation from magnetic resonance (MRI)
images. Our UDA approach models the co-dependency between images and their
segmentation as a joint probability distribution using a new structure
discriminator. The structure discriminator computes structure of interest
focused adversarial loss by combining the generated pseudo MRI with
probabilistic segmentations produced by a simultaneously trained segmentation
sub-network. The segmentation sub-network is trained using the pseudo MRI
produced by the generator sub-network. This leads to a cyclical optimization of
both the generator and segmentation sub-networks that are jointly trained as
part of an end-to-end network. Extensive experiments and comparisons against
multiple state-of-the-art methods were done on four different MRI sequences
totalling 257 scans for generating multi-organ and tumor segmentation. The
experiments included, (a) 20 T1-weighted (T1w) in-phase mdixon and (b) 20
T2-weighted (T2w) abdominal MRI for segmenting liver, spleen, left and right
kidneys, (c) 162 T2-weighted fat suppressed head and neck MRI (T2wFS) for
parotid gland segmentation, and (d) 75 T2w MRI for lung tumor segmentation. Our

concerned with the anticipation of the unobserved future from the current as
well as historical video observations. Action prediction is a major sub-area of
video predictive understanding and is the focus of this review. This sub-area
has two major subdivisions: early action recognition and future action
prediction. Early action recognition is concerned with recognizing an ongoing
action as soon as possible. Future action prediction is concerned with the
anticipation of actions that follow those previously observed. In either case,
the \textbf{\textit{causal}} relationship between the past, current, and
potential future information is the main focus. Various mathematical tools such
as Markov Chains, Gaussian Processes, Auto-Regressive modeling, and Bayesian
recursive filtering are widely adopted jointly with computer vision techniques
for these two tasks. However, these approaches face challenges such as the
curse of dimensionality, poor generalization, and constraints from
domain-specific knowledge. Recently, structures that rely on deep convolutional
neural networks and recurrent neural networks have been extensively proposed
for improving the performance of existing vision tasks, in general, and action
prediction tasks, in particular. However, they have their own shortcomings, \eg
reliance on massive training data and lack of strong theoretical underpinnings.
In this survey, we start by introducing the major sub-areas of the broad area
of video predictive understanding, which recently have received intensive
attention and proven to have practical value. Next, a thorough review of
various early action recognition and future action prediction algorithms are
provided with suitably organized divisions. Finally, we conclude our discussion
with future research directions.]]></summary>

Our hierarchical GNN uses a novel approach to merge connected components

Unlike fully unsupervised hierarchical clustering, the choice of grouping and
complexity criteria stems naturally from supervision in the training set. The
resulting method, Hi-LANDER, achieves an average of 54% improvement in F-score

GNN-based clustering algorithms. Additionally, state-of-the-art GNN-based
methods rely on separate models to predict linkage probabilities and node

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background and objective: In this paper, a modified U-Net based framework is
presented, which leverages techniques from Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block,
Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and residual learning for accurate and
robust liver CT segmentation, and the effectiveness of the proposed method was
tested on two public datasets LiTS17 and SLiver07.

Methods: A new network architecture called SAR-U-Net was designed. Firstly,
the SE block is introduced to adaptively extract image features after each
convolution in the U-Net encoder, while suppressing irrelevant regions, and
highlighting features of specific segmentation task; Secondly, ASPP was
employed to replace the transition layer and the output layer, and acquire
multi-scale image information via different receptive fields. Thirdly, to
alleviate the degradation problem, the traditional convolution block was
replaced with the residual block and thus prompt the network to gain accuracy
from considerably increased depth.

Results: In the LiTS17 experiment, the mean values of Dice, VOE, RVD, ASD and
MSD were 95.71, 9.52, -0.84, 1.54 and 29.14, respectively. Compared with other
closely related 2D-based models, the proposed method achieved the highest
accuracy. In the experiment of the SLiver07, the mean values of Dice, VOE, RVD,
ASD and MSD were 97.31, 5.37, -1.08, 1.85 and 27.45, respectively. Compared
with other closely related models, the proposed method achieved the highest
segmentation accuracy except for the RVD.

Conclusion: The proposed model enables a great improvement on the accuracy
compared to 2D-based models, and its robustness in circumvent challenging
problems, such as small liver regions, discontinuous liver regions, and fuzzy
liver boundaries, is also well demonstrated and validated.]]></summary>

properties of the data source that we can rely on to hypothesize about its
imbalance, such as distribution of land and water in the case of the Earth's
imagery. We present a new iterative method to balance unlabeled data. Our
method utilizes image embeddings as a proxy for image labels that can be used
to balance data, and ultimately when trained increases overall accuracy.]]></summary>

humans yet challenging for machines to reproduce. This is because most learning
algorithms strongly rely on the i.i.d.~assumption on source/target data, which
is often violated in practice due to domain shift. Domain generalization (DG)
aims to achieve OOD generalization by using only source data for model
learning. Since first introduced in 2011, research in DG has made great
progresses. In particular, intensive research in this topic has led to a broad
spectrum of methodologies, e.g., those based on domain alignment,
meta-learning, data augmentation, or ensemble learning, just to name a few; and
has covered various vision applications such as object recognition,
segmentation, action recognition, and person re-identification. In this paper,
for the first time a comprehensive literature review is provided to summarize
the developments in DG for computer vision over the past decade. Specifically,
we first cover the background by formally defining DG and relating it to other
research fields like domain adaptation and transfer learning. Second, we
conduct a thorough review into existing methods and present a categorization
based on their methodologies and motivations. Finally, we conclude this survey
with insights and discussions on future research directions.]]></summary>

and assess incurred damages, among other response tasks. As the volume and

computer vision and deep neural networks have enabled the development of models
for real-time image classification for a number of tasks, including detecting
crisis incidents, filtering irrelevant images, classifying images into specific
humanitarian categories, and assessing the severity of the damage. To develop
robust real-time models, it is necessary to understand the capability of the
publicly available pre-trained models for these tasks, which remains to be
under-explored in the crisis informatics literature. In this study, we address
such limitations by investigating ten different network architectures for four
different tasks using the largest publicly available datasets for these tasks.
We also explore various data augmentation strategies, semi-supervised

thus high-dimensional (e.g., design, text). Instead of treating unstructured
attributes as unobservables in economic models, quantifying them can be
important to answer interesting economic questions. To propose an analytical
framework for this type of products, this paper considers one of the simplest
design products -- fonts -- and investigates merger and product differentiation
using an original dataset from the world's largest online marketplace for
fonts. We quantify font shapes by constructing embeddings from a deep
convolutional neural network. Each embedding maps a font's shape onto a
low-dimensional vector. In the resulting product space, designers are assumed
to engage in Hotelling-type spatial competition. From the image embeddings, we
construct two alternative measures that capture the degree of design
differentiation. We then study the causal effects of a merger on the merging
firm's creative decisions using the constructed measures in a synthetic control
method. We find that the merger causes the merging firm to increase the visual
variety of font design. Notably, such effects are not captured when using
traditional measures for product offerings (e.g., specifications and the number

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we propose a similarity-aware fusion network (SAFNet) to
adaptively fuse 2D images and 3D point clouds for 3D semantic segmentation.
Existing fusion-based methods achieve remarkable performances by integrating
information from multiple modalities. However, they heavily rely on the
correspondence between 2D pixels and 3D points by projection and can only
perform the information fusion in a fixed manner, and thus their performances
cannot be easily migrated to a more realistic scenario where the collected data
often lack strict pair-wise features for prediction. To address this, we employ
a late fusion strategy where we first learn the geometric and contextual
similarities between the input and back-projected (from 2D pixels) point clouds
and utilize them to guide the fusion of two modalities to further exploit
complementary information. Specifically, we employ a geometric similarity
module (GSM) to directly compare the spatial coordinate distributions of
pair-wise 3D neighborhoods, and a contextual similarity module (CSM) to
aggregate and compare spatial contextual information of corresponding central
points. The two proposed modules can effectively measure how much image
features can help predictions, enabling the network to adaptively adjust the
contributions of two modalities to the final prediction of each point.
Experimental results on the ScanNetV2 benchmark demonstrate that SAFNet
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art fusion-based approaches
across various data integrity.]]></summary>

restrictions on data availability. To still obtain viable models, continual
learning aims to train in sequential order, as and when data is available. The
main challenge that continual learning methods face is to prevent catastrophic
forgetting, i.e., a decrease in performance on the data encountered earlier.
This issue makes continuous training of segmentation models for medical
applications extremely difficult. Yet, often, data from at least two different
domains is available which we can exploit to train the model in a way that it
disregards domain-specific information. We propose an architecture that
leverages the simultaneous availability of two or more datasets to learn a
disentanglement between the content and domain in an adversarial fashion. The
domain-invariant content representation then lays the base for continual
semantic segmentation. Our approach takes inspiration from domain adaptation
and combines it with continual learning for hippocampal segmentation in brain
MRI. We showcase that our method reduces catastrophic forgetting and
outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods.]]></summary>

and then relaxed to allow the primitive's parameters to be learned. This
relaxation allows end-to-end differentiable programs and deep networks to be

to be composed in ways that can mimic the physical reality of drawing rather

cancer computer-aided diagnosis and surgical planning. However, both the
accuracy and robustness of existing liver segmentation methods cannot meet the
requirements of clinical applications. In particular, for the common clinical
cases where the liver tissue contains major pathology, current segmentation
methods show poor performance. In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank
tensor decomposition (LRTD) based multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) framework that
achieves accurate and robust pathological liver segmentation of CT images.
Firstly, we propose a multi-slice LRTD scheme to recover the underlying
low-rank structure embedded in 3D medical images. It performs the LRTD on small
image segments consisting of multiple consecutive image slices. Then, we
present an LRTD-based atlas construction method to generate tumor-free liver
atlases that mitigates the performance degradation of liver segmentation due to
the presence of tumors. Finally, we introduce an LRTD-based MAS algorithm to
derive patient-specific liver atlases for each test image, and to achieve
accurate pairwise image registration and label propagation. Extensive
experiments on three public databases of pathological liver cases validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Both qualitative and quantitative results
demonstrate that, in the presence of major pathology, the proposed method is
more accurate and robust than state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

re-generated using the peak positions in the predicted heatmap to have a clear

domain to the target domain in a semi-supervised manner. In the experiments
using 8 combinations of domains, the proposed method outperformed the existing

incorporate a weighted difference of anisotropic and isotropic total variation
(AITV) to regularize the partition boundaries in an image. In particular, we
replace the total variation regularization in the Chan-Vese segmentation model
and a fuzzy region competition model by the proposed AITV. To deal with the
nonconvex nature of AITV, we apply the difference-of-convex algorithm (DCA), in
which the subproblems can be minimized by the primal-dual hybrid gradient
method with linesearch. The convergence of the DCA scheme is analyzed. In
addition, a generalization to color image segmentation is discussed. In the
numerical experiments, we compare the proposed models with the classic convex

creates a bridge between the Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision
domains of computer science. The task of generating a semantically accurate
description of a video is quite complex. Considering the complexity, of the
problem, the results obtained in recent research works are praiseworthy.
However, there is plenty of scope for further investigation. This paper
addresses this scope and proposes a novel solution. Most video captioning
models comprise two sequential/recurrent layers - one as a video-to-context
encoder and the other as a context-to-caption decoder. This paper proposes a
novel architecture, namely Semantically Sensible Video Captioning (SSVC) which
modifies the context generation mechanism by using two novel approaches -
"stacked attention" and "spatial hard pull". As there are no exclusive metrics
for evaluating video captioning models, we emphasize both quantitative and
qualitative analysis of our model. Hence, we have used the BLEU scoring metric
for quantitative analysis and have proposed a human evaluation metric for
qualitative analysis, namely the Semantic Sensibility (SS) scoring metric. SS
Score overcomes the shortcomings of common automated scoring metrics. This
paper reports that the use of the aforementioned novelties improves the
performance of state-of-the-art architectures.]]></summary>

attention and progress. State-of-the-art approaches adopting Graph
Convolutional networks (GCNs) can effectively extract features on human
skeletons relying on the pre-defined human topology. Despite associated
progress, GCN-based methods have difficulties to generalize across domains,
especially with different human topological structures. In this context, we
introduce UNIK, a novel skeleton-based action recognition method that is not
only effective to learn spatio-temporal features on human skeleton sequences
but also able to generalize across datasets. This is achieved by learning an
optimal dependency matrix from the uniform distribution based on a multi-head
attention mechanism. Subsequently, to study the cross-domain generalizability
of skeleton-based action recognition in real-world videos, we re-evaluate
state-of-the-art approaches as well as the proposed UNIK in light of a novel
Posetics dataset. This dataset is created from Kinetics-400 videos by
estimating, refining and filtering poses. We provide an analysis on how much
performance improves on smaller benchmark datasets after pre-training on
Posetics for the action classification task. Experimental results show that the
proposed UNIK, with pre-training on Posetics, generalizes well and outperforms
state-of-the-art when transferred onto four target action classification
datasets: Toyota Smarthome, Penn Action, NTU-RGB+D 60 and NTU-RGB+D 120.]]></summary>

pixel-wise visual features into the elevation map grids. In this way, we fuse
the structural features and visual features in the consistent bird-eye view
frame, yielding a semantic representation, namely CORAL. And the whole network
is called CORAL-VLAD. Comparisons on the Oxford RobotCar show that CORAL-VLAD

computer-assisted diagnosis and therapy systems, yet still faces many
challenges. In the past few years, the popular encoder-decoder architectures
based on CNNs (e.g., U-Net) have been successfully applied in the task of
medical image segmentation. However, due to the locality of convolution
operations, they demonstrate limitations in learning global context and
long-range spatial relations. Recently, several researchers try to introduce
transformers to both the encoder and decoder components with promising results,
but the efficiency requires further improvement due to the high computational
complexity of transformers. In this paper, we propose LeViT-UNet, which
integrates a LeViT Transformer module into the U-Net architecture, for fast and
accurate medical image segmentation. Specifically, we use LeViT as the encoder
of the LeViT-UNet, which better trades off the accuracy and efficiency of the
Transformer block. Moreover, multi-scale feature maps from transformer blocks
and convolutional blocks of LeViT are passed into the decoder via
skip-connection, which can effectively reuse the spatial information of the
feature maps. Our experiments indicate that the proposed LeViT-UNet achieves
better performance comparing to various competing methods on several
challenging medical image segmentation benchmarks including Synapse and ACDC.

auto-encoder, contrastive learning) allow deep learning models to learn
effective image representations from large-scale unlabeled data. In medical
image analysis, even unannotated data can be difficult to obtain for individual
labs. Fortunately, national-level efforts have been made to provide efficient
access to obtain biomedical image data from previous scientific publications.
For instance, NIH has launched the Open-i search engine that provides a
large-scale image database with free access. However, the images in scientific
publications consist of a considerable amount of compound figures with
subplots. To extract and curate individual subplots, many different compound
figure separation approaches have been developed, especially with the recent
advances in deep learning. However, previous approaches typically required
resource extensive bounding box annotation to train detection models. In this
paper, we propose a simple compound figure separation (SimCFS) framework that
uses weak classification annotations from individual images. Our technical
contribution is three-fold: (1) we introduce a new side loss that is designed
for compound figure separation; (2) we introduce an intra-class image
augmentation method to simulate hard cases; (3) the proposed framework enables
an efficient deployment to new classes of images, without requiring resource
extensive bounding box annotations. From the results, the SimCFS achieved a new
state-of-the-art performance on the ImageCLEF 2016 Compound Figure Separation
Database. The source code of SimCFS is made publicly available at

promising compression performance. Our work presents the first attempt to
leverage VAE-based compression in a flow-based framework. ANFIC advances
further compression efficiency by stacking and extending hierarchically
multiple VAE's. The invertibility of ANF, together with our training
strategies, enables ANFIC to support a wide range of quality levels without
changing the encoding and decoding networks. Extensive experimental results
show that in terms of PSNR-RGB, ANFIC performs comparably to or better than the
state-of-the-art learned image compression. Moreover, it performs close to VVC
intra coding, from low-rate compression up to nearly-lossless compression. In

-- a successful use of humor requires a mixture of both engaging content
build-up and an appropriate vocal delivery (e.g., pause). Prior studies on
computational humor emphasize the textual and audio features immediately next
to the punchline, yet overlooking longer-term context setup. Moreover, the
theories are usually too abstract for understanding each concrete humor
snippet. To fill in the gap, we develop DeHumor, a visual analytical system for
analyzing humorous behaviors in public speaking. To intuitively reveal the
building blocks of each concrete example, DeHumor decomposes each humorous
video into multimodal features and provides inline annotations of them on the
video script. In particular, to better capture the build-ups, we introduce
content repetition as a complement to features introduced in theories of
computational humor and visualize them in a context linking graph. To help
users locate the punchlines that have the desired features to learn, we
summarize the content (with keywords) and humor feature statistics on an
augmented time matrix. With case studies on stand-up comedy shows and TED
talks, we show that DeHumor is able to highlight various building blocks of

decoding algorithms to recover a sufficiently sparse vector or code from a
lower dimensional linear measurement vector. Typically it is assumed that the
decoder has access to the encoder matrix, which in the combinatorial case is
sparse and binary. In this paper we consider the problem of designing a decoder
to recover a set of sparse codes from their linear measurements alone, that is
without access to encoder matrix. To this end we study the matrix factorisation
task of recovering both the encoder and sparse coding matrices from the
associated linear measurement matrix. The contribution of this paper is a
computationally efficient decoding algorithm, Decoder-Expander Based
Factorisation, with strong performance guarantees. In particular, under mild
assumptions on the sparse coding matrix and by deploying a novel random encoder
matrix, we prove that Decoder-Expander Based Factorisation recovers both the
encoder and sparse coding matrix at the optimal measurement rate with high
probability and from a near optimal number of measurement vectors. In addition,
our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and computational efficiency of our

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study the problem of post-hoc calibration for multiclass classification,
with an emphasis on histogram binning. Multiple works have focused on
calibration with respect to the confidence of just the predicted class (or
'top-label'). We find that the popular notion of confidence calibration [Guo et
al., 2017] is not sufficiently strong -- there exist predictors that are not
calibrated in any meaningful way but are perfectly confidence calibrated. We
propose a closely related (but subtly different) notion, top-label calibration,
that accurately captures the intuition and simplicity of confidence
calibration, but addresses its drawbacks. We formalize a histogram binning (HB)
algorithm that reduces top-label multiclass calibration to the binary case,
prove that it has clean theoretical guarantees without distributional
assumptions, and perform a methodical study of its practical performance. Some
prediction tasks require stricter notions of multiclass calibration such as
class-wise or canonical calibration. We formalize appropriate HB algorithms
corresponding to each of these goals. In experiments with deep neural nets, we
find that our principled versions of HB are often better than temperature
scaling, for both top-label and class-wise calibration. Code for this work will
be made publicly available at https://github.com/aigen/df-posthoc-calibration.]]></summary>

economics, science and engineering. However, their numerical treatment poses
formidable challenges since traditional grid-based methods tend to be

trains provide an appealing approximation framework for parabolic PDEs: the
combination of reformulations in terms of backward stochastic differential
equations and regression-type methods in the tensor format holds the promise of
leveraging latent low-rank structures enabling both compression and efficient
computation. Following this paradigm, we develop novel iterative schemes,

cancer computer-aided diagnosis and surgical planning. However, both the
accuracy and robustness of existing liver segmentation methods cannot meet the
requirements of clinical applications. In particular, for the common clinical
cases where the liver tissue contains major pathology, current segmentation
methods show poor performance. In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank
tensor decomposition (LRTD) based multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) framework that
achieves accurate and robust pathological liver segmentation of CT images.
Firstly, we propose a multi-slice LRTD scheme to recover the underlying
low-rank structure embedded in 3D medical images. It performs the LRTD on small
image segments consisting of multiple consecutive image slices. Then, we
present an LRTD-based atlas construction method to generate tumor-free liver
atlases that mitigates the performance degradation of liver segmentation due to
the presence of tumors. Finally, we introduce an LRTD-based MAS algorithm to
derive patient-specific liver atlases for each test image, and to achieve
accurate pairwise image registration and label propagation. Extensive
experiments on three public databases of pathological liver cases validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Both qualitative and quantitative results
demonstrate that, in the presence of major pathology, the proposed method is
more accurate and robust than state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

everyday behaviors of individual organisms. Yet, most algorithms for
time-series modeling fail to learn dynamics of random event timings directly
from visual or audio inputs, requiring timing annotations during training that
are usually unavailable for real-world applications. For instance, neuroscience
perspectives on postdiction imply that there exist variable temporal ranges
within which the incoming sensory inputs can affect the earlier perception, but
such temporal ranges are mostly unannotated for real applications such as
automatic speech recognition (ASR). In this paper, we present a probabilistic
ordinary differential equation (ODE), called STochastic boundaRy ODE (STRODE),
that learns both the timings and the dynamics of time series data without
requiring any timing annotations during training. STRODE allows the usage of
differential equations to sample from the posterior point processes,
efficiently and analytically. We further provide theoretical guarantees on the
learning of STRODE. Our empirical results show that our approach successfully
infers event timings of time series data. Our method achieves competitive or
superior performances compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for both

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to recognize people's attitudes from
multiple communication channels such as verbal content (i.e., text), voice, and
facial expressions. It has become a vibrant and important research topic in
natural language processing. Much research focuses on modeling the complex
intra- and inter-modal interactions between different communication channels.
However, current multimodal models with strong performance are often
deep-learning-based techniques and work like black boxes. It is not clear how
models utilize multimodal information for sentiment predictions. Despite recent
advances in techniques for enhancing the explainability of machine learning
models, they often target unimodal scenarios (e.g., images, sentences), and
little research has been done on explaining multimodal models. In this paper,
we present an interactive visual analytics system, M2Lens, to visualize and
explain multimodal models for sentiment analysis. M2Lens provides explanations
on intra- and inter-modal interactions at the global, subset, and local levels.
Specifically, it summarizes the influence of three typical interaction types
(i.e., dominance, complement, and conflict) on the model predictions. Moreover,
M2Lens identifies frequent and influential multimodal features and supports the
multi-faceted exploration of model behaviors from language, acoustic, and
visual modalities. Through two case studies and expert interviews, we
demonstrate our system can help users gain deep insights into the multimodal
models for sentiment analysis.]]></summary>

machine learning model which is fair against every protected attribute (e.g.
both sex and race) at the same time. To solve this problem, we propose
FairBalance in this paper to balance the distribution of training data across
every protected attribute before training the machine learning models. Our
results show that, under the assumption of unbiased ground truth labels,
FairBalance can significantly reduce bias metrics (AOD, EOD, and SPD) on every

Mainstream FL approaches require each participant to share a common network

heterogeneous network architectures; and the data distribution is almost
certainly non-uniform across participants. To address these issues we introduce
FedH2L, which is agnostic to both the model architecture and robust to
different data distributions across participants. In contrast to approaches
sharing parameters or gradients, FedH2L relies on mutual distillation,
exchanging only posteriors on a shared seed set between participants in a
decentralized manner. This makes it extremely bandwidth efficient, model

past knowledge while being trained on new tasks. Common techniques to handle CF
include regularization of the weights (using, e.g., their importance on past
tasks), and rehearsal strategies, where the network is constantly re-trained on
past data. Generative models have also been applied for the latter, in order to
have endless sources of data. In this paper, we propose a novel method that
combines the strengths of regularization and generative-based rehearsal
approaches. Our generative model consists of a normalizing flow (NF), a
probabilistic and invertible neural network, trained on the internal embeddings
of the network. By keeping a single NF conditioned on the task, we show that
our memory overhead remains constant. In addition, exploiting the invertibility
of the NF, we propose a simple approach to regularize the network's embeddings
with respect to past tasks. We show that our method performs favorably with

research heavily relies on the labelled training data, which are time-costly
and labor-intensive to collect. To alleviate the critical dependency on the
training data in real-world applications, this study aims to improve
classification accuracy via data augmentation strategies. The effectiveness of
five data augmentation strategies under different training data inadequacy are
investigated in two scenarios: the noise-free scenario where different
availabilities of unlabelled data were considered, and the noisy scenario where
different levels of Gaussian noises and translational shifts were added to
represent sensor drifts. The five augmentation strategies, namely noise-adding
data augmentation, semi-supervised learning, classifier-based online learning,
Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) online learning and our novel ensemble ICP
online learning proposed in this study, are experimented and compared against
supervised learning baseline, with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and
Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the classifiers. Our novel strategy, ensemble
ICP online learning, outperforms the others by showing non-decreasing
classification accuracy on all tasks and a significant improvement on most
simulated tasks (25out of 36 tasks,p<=0.05). Furthermore, this study provides a
systematic analysis of different augmentation strategies. It shows at least one
strategy significantly improved the classification accuracy with LDA (p<=0.05)

particular, our proposed strategy demonstrated both effectiveness and
robustness in boosting the classification model generalizability, which can be

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Optimal transport (OT) distances are increasingly used as loss functions for
statistical inference, notably in the learning of generative models or
supervised learning. Yet, the behavior of minimum Wasserstein estimators is
poorly understood, notably in high-dimensional regimes or under model
misspecification. In this work we adopt the viewpoint of projection robust (PR)
OT, which seeks to maximize the OT cost between two measures by choosing a
$k$-dimensional subspace onto which they can be projected. Our first
contribution is to establish several fundamental statistical properties of PR
Wasserstein distances, complementing and improving previous literature that has
been restricted to one-dimensional and well-specified cases. Next, we propose
the integral PR Wasserstein (IPRW) distance as an alternative to the PRW
distance, by averaging rather than optimizing on subspaces. Our complexity
bounds can help explain why both PRW and IPRW distances outperform Wasserstein
distances empirically in high-dimensional inference tasks. Finally, we consider
parametric inference using the PRW distance. We provide an asymptotic guarantee
of two types of minimum PRW estimators and formulate a central limit theorem
for max-sliced Wasserstein estimator under model misspecification. To enable
our analysis on PRW with projection dimension larger than one, we devise a
novel combination of variational analysis and statistical theory.]]></summary>

(image recognition, decision-making, NLP, image synthesis), self-driving
technology has not yet followed the same trend. In this paper, we study the

stack. We argue that the slow progress is caused by approaches that require too
much hand-engineering, an over-reliance on road testing, and high fleet
deployment costs. We observe that the classical stack has several bottlenecks
that preclude the necessary scale needed to capture the long tail of rare
events. To resolve these problems, we outline the principles of Autonomy 2.0,
an ML-first approach to self-driving, as a viable alternative to the currently
adopted state-of-the-art. This approach is based on (i) a fully differentiable
AV stack trainable from human demonstrations, (ii) closed-loop data-driven
reactive simulation, and (iii) large-scale, low-cost data collections as
critical solutions towards scalability issues. We outline the general

modeling, machine learning and artificial intelligence. They allow us to
integrate in a natural way expert knowledge, physical modeling, heterogeneous
and correlated data and quantities of interest. For exactly this reason,
multiple sources of model uncertainty are inherent within the modular structure
of the graphical model. In this paper we develop information-theoretic, robust
uncertainty quantification methods and non-parametric stress tests for directed
graphical models to assess the effect and the propagation through the graph of
multi-sourced model uncertainties to quantities of interest. These methods
allow us to rank the different sources of uncertainty and correct the graphical
model by targeting its most impactful components with respect to the quantities
of interest. Thus, from a machine learning perspective, we provide a
mathematically rigorous approach to correctability that guarantees a systematic
selection for improvement of components of a graphical model while controlling
potential new errors created in the process in other parts of the model. We
demonstrate our methods in two physico-chemical examples, namely quantum
scale-informed chemical kinetics and materials screening to improve the
efficiency of fuel cells.]]></summary>

generating mind-blowing photorealistic images that mimic the content of
datasets they were trained to replicate. One recurrent theme in medical imaging
is whether GANs can also be effective at generating workable medical data as
they are for generating realistic RGB images. In this paper, we perform a
multi-GAN and multi-application study to gauge the benefits of GANs in medical
imaging. We tested various GAN architectures from basic DCGAN to more
sophisticated style-based GANs on three medical imaging modalities and organs
namely : cardiac cine-MRI, liver CT and RGB retina images. GANs were trained on
well-known and widely utilized datasets from which their FID score were
computed to measure the visual acuity of their generated images. We further
tested their usefulness by measuring the segmentation accuracy of a U-Net
trained on these generated images.

Results reveal that GANs are far from being equal as some are ill-suited for
medical imaging applications while others are much better off. The
top-performing GANs are capable of generating realistic-looking medical images
by FID standards that can fool trained experts in a visual Turing test and
comply to some metrics. However, segmentation results suggests that no GAN is
capable of reproducing the full richness of a medical datasets.]]></summary>

learning projects. Similar to lean startups and lean manufacturing, we argue
that lean machine learning (LeanML) can drastically slash avoidable wastes in
commercial machine learning projects, reduce the business risk in investing in
machine learning capabilities and, in so doing, further democratize access to
machine learning. The lean design pattern we propose in this paper is based on
two realizations. First, it is possible to estimate the best performance one
may achieve when predicting an outcome $y \in \mathcal{Y}$ using a given set of
explanatory variables $x \in \mathcal{X}$, for a wide range of performance
metrics, and without training any predictive model. Second, doing so is
considerably easier, faster, and cheaper than learning the best predictive
model. We derive formulae expressing the best $R^2$, MSE, classification
accuracy, and log-likelihood per observation achievable when using $x$ to
predict $y$ as a function of the mutual information $I\left(y; x\right)$, and
possibly a measure of the variability of $y$ (e.g. its Shannon entropy in the
case of classification accuracy, and its variance in the case regression MSE).
We illustrate the efficacy of the LeanML design pattern on a wide range of
regression and classification problems, synthetic and real-life.]]></summary>

(LTH) (Frankle & Carbin, 2018) pointed out that there could exist a winning
ticket (i.e., a properly pruned sub-network together with original weight
initialization) that can achieve competitive performance than the original
dense network. However, it is not easy to observe such winning property in many
scenarios, where for example, a relatively large learning rate is used even if
it benefits training the original dense model. In this work, we investigate the
underlying condition and rationale behind the winning property, and find that
the underlying reason is largely attributed to the correlation between
initialized weights and final-trained weights when the learning rate is not
sufficiently large. Thus, the existence of winning property is correlated with
an insufficient DNN pretraining, and is unlikely to occur for a well-trained
DNN. To overcome this limitation, we propose the "pruning & fine-tuning" method
that consistently outperforms lottery ticket sparse training under the same
pruning algorithm and the same total training epochs. Extensive experiments
over multiple deep models (VGG, ResNet, MobileNet-v2) on different datasets
have been conducted to justify our proposals.]]></summary>

their pace to use machine learning longitudinal motion planning (mMP) for
autonomous vehicles (AVs). This paper reviews the current state of the art in
mMP, with an exclusive focus on its impact on traffic congestion. We identify
the availability of congestion scenarios in current datasets, and summarize the
required features for training mMP. For learning methods, we survey the major
methods in both imitation learning and non-imitation learning. We also
highlight the emerging technologies adopted by some leading AV companies, e.g.
Tesla, Waymo, and Comma.ai. We find that: i) the AV industry has been mostly
focusing on the long tail problem related to safety and overlooked the impact
on traffic congestion, ii) the current public self-driving datasets have not
included enough congestion scenarios, and mostly lack the necessary input
features/output labels to train mMP, and iii) albeit reinforcement learning
(RL) approach can integrate congestion mitigation into the learning goal, the
major mMP method adopted by industry is still behavior cloning (BC), whose
capability to learn a congestion-mitigating mMP remains to be seen. Based on
the review, the study identifies the research gaps in current mMP development.
Some suggestions towards congestion mitigation for future mMP studies are
proposed: i) enrich data collection to facilitate the congestion learning, ii)
incorporate non-imitation learning methods to combine traffic efficiency into a
safety-oriented technical route, and iii) integrate domain knowledge from the
traditional car following (CF) theory to improve the string stability of mMP.]]></summary>

unanswered: what is the impact of these approaches on subsequent related tasks?
In this paper, the focus is put on facial expression recognition (FER), where
facial landmarks are used for face registration, which is a common usage. Since
the most used datasets for facial landmark localization do not allow for a
proper measurement of performance according to the different difficulties
(e.g., pose, expression, illumination, occlusion, motion blur), we also
quantify the performance of recent approaches in the presence of head pose
variations and facial expressions. Finally, a study of the impact of these
approaches on FER is conducted. We show that the landmark accuracy achieved so
far optimizing the conventional Euclidean distance does not necessarily
guarantee a gain in performance for FER. To deal with this issue, we propose a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using offline training schemes, researchers have tackled the event
segmentation problem by providing full or weak-supervision through manually
annotated labels or self-supervised epoch-based training. Most works consider
videos that are at most 10's of minutes long. We present a self-supervised
perceptual prediction framework capable of temporal event segmentation by
building stable representations of objects over time and demonstrate it on long
videos, spanning several days. The approach is deceptively simple but quite
effective. We rely on predictions of high-level features computed by a standard
deep learning backbone. For prediction, we use an LSTM, augmented with an
attention mechanism, trained in a self-supervised manner using the prediction
error. The self-learned attention maps effectively localize and track the
event-related objects in each frame. The proposed approach does not require
labels. It requires only a single pass through the video, with no separate
training set. Given the lack of datasets of very long videos, we demonstrate
our method on video from 10 days (254 hours) of continuous wildlife monitoring
data that we had collected with required permissions. We find that the approach
is robust to various environmental conditions such as day/night conditions,
rain, sharp shadows, and windy conditions. For the task of temporally locating
events, we had an 80% recall rate at 20% false-positive rate for frame-level
segmentation. At the activity level, we had an 80% activity recall rate for one
false activity detection every 50 minutes. We will make the dataset, which is
the first of its kind, and the code available to the research community.]]></summary>

the state-of-the-art model accuracy for various applications. However, the
enhanced accuracy comes at the cost of substantial memory bandwidth and storage
requirements and demanding computational resources. Although in the past the
quantization methods have effectively reduced the deployment cost for edge
devices, it suffers from significant information loss when processing the
biased activations of contemporary CNNs. In this paper, we hence introduce an
adaptive high-performance quantization method to resolve the issue of biased
activation by dynamically adjusting the scaling and shifting factors based on
the task loss. Our proposed method has been extensively evaluated on image
classification models (ResNet-18/34/50, MobileNet-V2, EfficientNet-B0) with
ImageNet dataset, object detection model (YOLO-V4) with COCO dataset, and
language models with PTB dataset. The results show that our 4-bit integer
(INT4) quantization models achieve better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
4-bit models, and in some cases, even surpass the golden full-precision models.
The final designs have been successfully deployed onto extremely
resource-constrained edge devices for many practical applications.]]></summary>

recent advanced deep learning-based models encourage the predicted results to
approximate the ground-truth masks with as large predictable areas as possible,
thus achieving the state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods do not
pay enough attention to small areas prone to misprediction. In this way, it is
still tough to accurately locate salient objects due to the existence of
regions with indistinguishable foreground and background and regions with
complex or fine structures. To address these problems, we propose a novel
convolutional neural network with purificatory mechanism and structural
similarity loss. Specifically, in order to better locate preliminary salient
objects, we first introduce the promotion attention, which is based on spatial
and channel attention mechanisms to promote attention to salient regions.
Subsequently, for the purpose of restoring the indistinguishable regions that
can be regarded as error-prone regions of one model, we propose the
rectification attention, which is learned from the areas of wrong prediction
and guide the network to focus on error-prone regions thus rectifying errors.
Through these two attentions, we use the Purificatory Mechanism to impose
strict weights with different regions of the whole salient objects and purify
results from hard-to-distinguish regions, thus accurately predicting the
locations and details of salient objects. In addition to paying different
attention to these hard-to-distinguish regions, we also consider the structural
constraints on complex regions and propose the Structural Similarity Loss. In
experiments, the proposed approach outperforms 19 state-of-the-art methods on
six datasets with a notable margin at over 27FPS on a single NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU.]]></summary>

challenging task in semantic image segmentation. Compact segmentation networks
are more widely used in the case of limited resources, while their performances
are constrained. In this paper, motivated by the residual learning and global
aggregation, we propose a simple yet general and effective knowledge
distillation framework called double similarity distillation (DSD) to improve
the classification accuracy of all existing compact networks by capturing the
similarity knowledge in pixel and category dimensions, respectively.
Specifically, we propose a pixel-wise similarity distillation (PSD) module that
utilizes residual attention maps to capture more detailed spatial dependencies
across multiple layers. Compared with exiting methods, the PSD module greatly
reduces the amount of calculation and is easy to expand. Furthermore,
considering the differences in characteristics between semantic segmentation
task and other computer vision tasks, we propose a category-wise similarity
distillation (CSD) module, which can help the compact segmentation network
strengthen the global category correlation by constructing the correlation
matrix. Combining these two modules, DSD framework has no extra parameters and
only a minimal increase in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on four challenging
datasets, including Cityscapes, CamVid, ADE20K, and Pascal VOC 2012, show that
DSD outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, proving its effectiveness and
generality. The code and models will be publicly available.]]></summary>

past knowledge while being trained on new tasks. Common techniques to handle CF
include regularization of the weights (using, e.g., their importance on past
tasks), and rehearsal strategies, where the network is constantly re-trained on
past data. Generative models have also been applied for the latter, in order to
have endless sources of data. In this paper, we propose a novel method that
combines the strengths of regularization and generative-based rehearsal
approaches. Our generative model consists of a normalizing flow (NF), a
probabilistic and invertible neural network, trained on the internal embeddings
of the network. By keeping a single NF conditioned on the task, we show that
our memory overhead remains constant. In addition, exploiting the invertibility
of the NF, we propose a simple approach to regularize the network's embeddings

damages, and uprooting communities, ecosystems and economies. Accurate and
robust flood detection including delineating open water flood areas and
identifying flood levels can aid in disaster response and mitigation. However,
estimating flood levels remotely is of essence as physical access to flooded
areas is limited and the ability to deploy instruments in potential flood zones
can be dangerous. Aligning flood extent mapping with local topography can
provide a plan-of-action that the disaster response team can consider. Thus,
remote flood level estimation via satellites like Sentinel-1 can prove to be
remedial. The Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence (ETCI)
competition on Flood Detection tasked participants with predicting flooded
pixels after training with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images in a
supervised setting. We use a cyclical approach involving two stages (1)
training an ensemble model of multiple UNet architectures with available high
and low confidence labeled data and, (2) generating pseudo labels or low
confidence labels on the unlabeled test dataset, and then, combining the
generated labels with the previously available high confidence labeled dataset.
This assimilated dataset is used for the next round of training ensemble
models. This cyclical process is repeated until the performance improvement
plateaus. Additionally, we post process our results with Conditional Random
Fields. Our approach sets a high score on the public leaderboard for the ETCI

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Designing off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms is typically a very
challenging task, because a desirable iteration update often involves an
expectation over an on-policy distribution. Prior off-policy actor-critic (AC)
algorithms have introduced a new critic that uses the density ratio for
adjusting the distribution mismatch in order to stabilize the convergence, but
at the cost of potentially introducing high biases due to the estimation errors
of both the density ratio and value function. In this paper, we develop a
doubly robust off-policy AC (DR-Off-PAC) for discounted MDP, which can take
advantage of learned nuisance functions to reduce estimation errors. Moreover,
DR-Off-PAC adopts a single timescale structure, in which both actor and critics
are updated simultaneously with constant stepsize, and is thus more sample
efficient than prior algorithms that adopt either two timescale or nested-loop
structure. We study the finite-time convergence rate and characterize the
sample complexity for DR-Off-PAC to attain an $\epsilon$-accurate optimal
policy. We also show that the overall convergence of DR-Off-PAC is doubly
robust to the approximation errors that depend only on the expressive power of
approximation functions. To the best of our knowledge, our study establishes
the first overall sample complexity analysis for a single time-scale off-policy
AC algorithm.]]></summary>

vision. Due to immense variability in scanners' parameters and imaging
protocols, even images obtained from the same person and the same scanner could
differ significantly. We address variability in computed tomography (CT) images
caused by different convolution kernels used in the reconstruction process, the
critical domain shift factor in CT. The choice of a convolution kernel affects
pixels' granularity, image smoothness, and noise level. We analyze a dataset of
paired CT images, where smooth and sharp images were reconstructed from the
same sinograms with different kernels, thus providing identical anatomy but
different style. Though identical predictions are desired, we show that the
consistency, measured as the average Dice between predictions on pairs, is just
0.54. We propose Filtered Back-Projection Augmentation (FBPAug), a simple and
surprisingly efficient approach to augment CT images in sinogram space
emulating reconstruction with different kernels. We apply the proposed method
in a zero-shot domain adaptation setup and show that the consistency boosts
from 0.54 to 0.92 outperforming other augmentation approaches. Neither specific

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An Axial Shifted MLP architecture (AS-MLP) is proposed in this paper.
Different from MLP-Mixer, where the global spatial feature is encoded for the
information flow through matrix transposition and one token-mixing MLP, we pay
more attention to the local features communication. By axially shifting
channels of the feature map, AS-MLP is able to obtain the information flow from
different axial directions, which captures the local dependencies. Such an
operation enables us to utilize a pure MLP architecture to achieve the same
local receptive field as CNN-like architecture. We can also design the
receptive field size and dilation of blocks of AS-MLP, etc, just like designing
those of convolution kernels. With the proposed AS-MLP architecture, our model
obtains 83.3% Top-1 accuracy with 88M parameters and 15.2 GFLOPs on the
ImageNet-1K dataset. Such a simple yet effective architecture outperforms all
MLP-based architectures and achieves competitive performance compared to the
transformer-based architectures (e.g., Swin Transformer) even with slightly
lower FLOPs. In addition, AS-MLP is also the first MLP-based architecture to be
applied to the downstream tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic
segmentation). The experimental results are also impressive. Our proposed
AS-MLP obtains 51.5 mAP on the COCO validation set and 49.5 MS mIoU on the
ADE20K dataset, which is competitive compared to the transformer-based
architectures. Code is available at https://github.com/svip-lab/AS-MLP.]]></summary>

functions have super-linearly growing and discontinuous stochastic gradients.
In such a setting, we provide a non-asymptotic analysis for the tamed

key paradigm in machine learning. Numerical experiments are presented for the
aforementioned example which supports our theoretical findings. Hence, in this
setting, we demonstrate both theoretically and numerically that the TUSLA
algorithm can solve the optimization problem involving neural networks with
ReLU activation function. Besides, we provide simulation results for synthetic
examples where popular algorithms, e.g. ADAM, AMSGrad, RMSProp, and (vanilla)

super-linear growth and the discontinuity of the corresponding stochastic

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sleep staging assumes an important role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
In general, experts classify sleep stages manually based on polysomnography
(PSG), which is quite time-consuming. Meanwhile, the acquisition of multiple
signals is complex, which can affect the subject's sleep. Therefore, the use of
single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) for automatic sleep staging has
become mainstream. In the literature, a large number of sleep staging methods
based on single-channel EEG have been proposed with good results and realize
the preliminary automation of sleep staging. However, the performance for most
of these methods in the N1 stage is generally not high. In this paper, we
propose a deep learning model SDAN based on raw EEG. The method utilises a
one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically extract
features from raw EEG. It serially combines the channel attention and spatial
attention mechanisms to filter and highlight key information and then uses soft
threshold to eliminate redundant information. Additionally, we introduce a
residual network to avoid degradation problems caused by network deepening.
Experiments were conducted using two datasets with 5-fold cross-validation and
hold-out validation method. The final average accuracy, overall accuracy, macro
F1 score and Cohen's Kappa coefficient of the model reach 96.74%, 91.86%,
82.64% and 0.8742 on the Sleep-EDF dataset, and 95.98%, 89.96%, 79.08% and
0.8216 on the Sleep-EDFx dataset. Significantly, our model performed superiorly
in the N1 stage, with F1 scores of 54.08% and 52.49% on the two datasets
respectively. The results show the superiority of our network over the best
existing methods, reaching a new state-of-the-art. In particular, the present
method achieves excellent results in the N1 sleep stage compared to other
methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most recent graph clustering methods have resorted to Graph Auto-Encoders
(GAEs) to perform joint clustering and embedding learning. However, two
critical issues have been overlooked. First, the accumulative error, inflicted
by learning with noisy clustering assignments, degrades the effectiveness and
robustness of the clustering model. This problem is called Feature Randomness.
Second, reconstructing the adjacency matrix sets the model to learn irrelevant
similarities for the clustering task. This problem is called Feature Drift.
Interestingly, the theoretical relation between the aforementioned problems has
not yet been investigated. We study these issues from two aspects: (1) the
existence of a trade-off between Feature Randomness and Feature Drift when
clustering and reconstruction are performed at the same level, and (2) the
problem of Feature Drift is more pronounced for GAE models, compared with
vanilla auto-encoder models, due to the graph convolutional operation and the
graph decoding design. Motivated by these findings, we reformulate the
GAE-based clustering methodology. Our solution is two-fold. First, we propose a
sampling operator $\Xi$ that triggers a protection mechanism against the noisy
clustering assignments. Second, we propose an operator $\Upsilon$ that triggers
a correction mechanism against Feature Drift by gradually transforming the
reconstructed graph into a clustering-oriented one. As principal advantages,
our solution grants a considerable improvement in clustering effectiveness and
robustness and can be easily tailored to existing GAE models.]]></summary>

(e.g., Uber or Lyft) have attracted much attention from both the academia and
the industry. In this paper, we consider an important dynamic car-hailing
problem, namely \textit{maximum revenue vehicle dispatching} (MRVD), in which
rider requests dynamically arrive and drivers need to serve as many riders as
possible such that the entire revenue of the platform is maximized. We prove
that the MRVD problem is NP-hard and intractable. In addition, the dynamic
car-hailing platforms have no information of the future riders, which makes the
problem even harder. To handle the MRVD problem, we propose a queueing-based
vehicle dispatching framework, which first uses existing machine learning
algorithms to predict the future vehicle demand of each region, then estimates
the idle time periods of drivers through a queueing model for each region. With
the information of the predicted vehicle demands and estimated idle time
periods of drivers, we propose two batch-based vehicle dispatching algorithms
to efficiently assign suitable drivers to riders such that the expected overall
revenue of the platform is maximized during each batch processing. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our

on-the-fly, power-efficient data processing, occurring as a wave propagates
through an artificially engineered medium. Yet, due to the fundamentally weak
non-linearities of traditional wave materials, such analog processors have been
so far largely confined to simple linear projections such as image edge

which inherently require strong non-linearities, have so far remained
out-of-reach of wave-based solutions, with a few attempts that implemented
non-linearities on the digital front, or used weak and inflexible non-linear
sensors, restraining the learning performance. Here, we tackle this issue by
demonstrating the relevance of Time-Floquet physics to induce a strong
non-linear entanglement between signal inputs at different frequencies,
enabling a power-efficient and versatile wave platform for analog extreme deep
learning involving a single, uniformly modulated dielectric layer and a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problem of labeled graph generation is gaining attention in the Deep
Learning community. The task is challenging due to the sparse and discrete
nature of graph spaces. Several approaches have been proposed in the
literature, most of which require to transform the graphs into sequences that
encode their structure and labels and to learn the distribution of such
sequences through an auto-regressive generative model. Among this family of
approaches, we focus on the GraphGen model. The preprocessing phase of GraphGen
transforms graphs into unique edge sequences called Depth-First Search (DFS)
codes, such that two isomorphic graphs are assigned the same DFS code. Each
element of a DFS code is associated with a graph edge: specifically, it is a
quintuple comprising one node identifier for each of the two endpoints, their
node labels, and the edge label. GraphGen learns to generate such sequences
auto-regressively and models the probability of each component of the quintuple
independently. While effective, the independence assumption made by the model
is too loose to capture the complex label dependencies of real-world graphs
precisely. By introducing a novel graph preprocessing approach, we are able to
process the labeling information of both nodes and edges jointly. The
corresponding model, which we term GraphGen-Redux, improves upon the generative
performances of GraphGen in a wide range of datasets of chemical and social
graphs. In addition, it uses approximately 78% fewer parameters than the
vanilla variant and requires 50% fewer epochs of training on average.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We extend the theory of PAC learning in a way which allows to model a rich
variety of learning tasks where the data satisfy special properties that ease
the learning process. For example, tasks where the distance of the data from
the decision boundary is bounded away from zero. The basic and simple idea is
to consider partial concepts: these are functions that can be undefined on
certain parts of the space. When learning a partial concept, we assume that the
source distribution is supported only on points where the partial concept is
defined.

This way, one can naturally express assumptions on the data such as lying on
a lower dimensional surface or margin conditions. In contrast, it is not at all
clear that such assumptions can be expressed by the traditional PAC theory. In
fact we exhibit easy-to-learn partial concept classes which provably cannot be
captured by the traditional PAC theory. This also resolves a question posed by
Attias, Kontorovich, and Mansour 2019.

We characterize PAC learnability of partial concept classes and reveal an
algorithmic landscape which is fundamentally different than the classical one.
For example, in the classical PAC model, learning boils down to Empirical Risk
Minimization (ERM). In stark contrast, we show that the ERM principle fails in
explaining learnability of partial concept classes. In fact, we demonstrate
classes that are incredibly easy to learn, but such that any algorithm that
learns them must use an hypothesis space with unbounded VC dimension. We also
find that the sample compression conjecture fails in this setting.

Thus, this theory features problems that cannot be represented nor solved in
the traditional way. We view this as evidence that it might provide insights on
the nature of learnability in realistic scenarios which the classical theory

propose a new sampling algorithm that converges to a global optimal solution
and suffers minimally from the curse of dimensionality. The algorithm consists
of two stages. First, we take samples following a sparse grid experimental
design and approximate the response surface via kernel ridge regression with a
Brownian field kernel. Second, we follow the expected improvement strategy --
with critical modifications that boost the algorithm's sample efficiency -- to
iteratively sample from the next level of the sparse grid. Under mild
conditions on the smoothness of the response surface and the simulation noise,
we establish upper bounds on the convergence rate for both noise-free and noisy
simulation samples. These upper rates deteriorate only slightly in the
dimension of the feasible set, and they can be improved if the objective
function is known be of a higher-order smoothness. Extensive numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm dramatically outperforms
typical alternatives in practice.]]></summary>

and can be an important backbone in reinforcement learning and planning.
However, existing approaches suffer in partially-observable environments due to
the lack of belief states. In this paper, we propose Structured World Belief, a
model for learning and inference of object-centric belief states. Inferred by
Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), our belief states provide multiple object-centric
scene hypotheses. To synergize the benefits of SMC particles with object
representations, we also propose a new object-centric dynamics model that
considers the inductive bias of object permanence. This enables tracking of
object states even when they are invisible for a long time. To further
facilitate object tracking in this regime, we allow our model to attend
flexibly to any spatial location in the image which was restricted in previous
models. In experiments, we show that object-centric belief provides a more

show the efficacy of structured world belief in improving the performance of

in machine learning. In this paper, we investigate the excess risk performance

for supervised learning, current theoretical understandings of ERM and SGD are
either have stronger assumptions in convex learning, e.g., strong convexity
condition, or show slow rates and less studied in nonconvex learning. Motivated
by these problems, we aim to provide improved rates under milder assumptions in
convex learning and derive faster rates in nonconvex learning. It is notable
that our analysis span two popular theoretical viewpoints: stability and
uniform convergence. To be specific, in stability regime, we present high
probability rates of order $\mathcal{O} (1/n)$ w.r.t. the sample size $n$ for
ERM and SGD with milder assumptions in convex learning and similar high
probability rates of order $\mathcal{O} (1/n)$ in nonconvex learning, rather
than in expectation. Furthermore, this type of learning rate is improved to
faster order $\mathcal{O} (1/n^2)$ in uniform convergence regime. To the best

model that can be trained end-to-end. Translatotron 2 consists of a speech

suggest that Translatotron 2 outperforms the original Translatotron by a large

drastically improves the robustness of the predicted speech by mitigating
over-generation, such as babbling or long pause. We also propose a new method
for retaining the source speaker's voice in the translated speech. The trained
model is restricted to retain the source speaker's voice, and unlike the
original Translatotron, it is not able to generate speech in a different
speaker's voice, making the model more robust for production deployment, by
mitigating potential misuse for creating spoofing audio artifacts. When the new

inference by introducing a series of topologies defined on general spaces of
structural causal models (SCMs). As an illustration of the framework we prove a
topological causal hierarchy theorem, showing that substantive assumption-free
causal inference is possible only in a meager set of SCMs. Thanks to a known
correspondence between open sets in the weak topology and statistically
verifiable hypotheses, our results show that inductive assumptions sufficient
to license valid causal inferences are statistically unverifiable in principle.
Similar to no-free-lunch theorems for statistical inference, the present
results clarify the inevitability of substantial assumptions for causal
inference. An additional benefit of our topological approach is that it easily
accommodates SCMs with infinitely many variables. We finally suggest that the
framework may be helpful for the positive project of exploring and assessing
alternative causal-inductive assumptions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data quality is a common problem in machine learning, especially in
high-stakes settings such as healthcare. Missing data affects accuracy,
calibration, and feature attribution in complex patterns. Developers often
train models on carefully curated datasets to minimize missing data bias;
however, this reduces the usability of such models in production environments,
such as real-time healthcare records. Making machine learning models robust to
missing data is therefore crucial for practical application. While some
classifiers naturally handle missing data, others, such as deep neural
networks, are not designed for unknown values. We propose a novel neural
network modification to mitigate the impacts of missing data. The approach is
inspired by neuromodulation that is performed by biological neural networks.
Our proposal replaces the fixed weights of a fully-connected layer with a
function of an additional input (reliability score) at each input, mimicking
the ability of cortex to up- and down-weight inputs based on the presence of
other data. The modulation function is jointly learned with the main task using
a multi-layer perceptron. We tested our modulating fully connected layer on
multiple classification, regression, and imputation problems, and it either
improved performance or generated comparable performance to conventional neural
network architectures concatenating reliability to the inputs. Models with
modulating layers were more robust against degradation of data quality by
introducing additional missingness at evaluation time. These results suggest
that explicitly accounting for reduced information quality with a modulating
fully connected layer can enable the deployment of artificial intelligence
systems in real-time settings.]]></summary>

learning. Second, based on the theoretical model, we introduce D-MUX: a
deceptive multiplexer-based logic-locking scheme that is resilient against

uncover a major fallacy in existing multiplexer-based locking schemes in the

for generating synthesized data similar to real data by jointly training a
generator and a discriminator. In many applications, data and computational
resources are distributed over many devices, so centralized computation with
all data in one location is infeasible due to privacy and/or communication
constraints. This paper proposes a new framework for training GANs in a
distributed fashion: Each device computes a local discriminator using local
data; a single server aggregates their results and computes a global GAN.
Specifically, in each iteration, the server sends the global GAN to the
devices, which then update their local discriminators; the devices send their
results to the server, which then computes their average as the global
discriminator and updates the global generator accordingly. Two different
update schedules are designed with different levels of parallelism between the
devices and the server. Numerical results obtained using three popular datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework can outperform a state-of-the-art
framework in terms of convergence speed.]]></summary>

costs of cloud-data services. At the same time, it is incredibly hard for users
to allocate resources per query in serverless processing systems, and they
frequently misallocate by orders of magnitude. Unfortunately, prior work
focused on predicting peak allocation while ignoring aggressive trade-offs
between resource allocation and run-time. Additionally, these methods fail to
predict allocation for queries that have not been observed in the past. In this
paper, we tackle both these problems. We introduce a system for optimal
resource allocation that can predict performance with aggressive trade-offs,
for both new and past observed queries. We introduce the notion of a
performance characteristic curve (PCC) as a parameterized representation that
can compactly capture the relationship between resources and performance. To
tackle training data sparsity, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique
to efficiently synthesize the entire PCC using a single run of the query.
Lastly, we demonstrate the advantages of a constrained loss function coupled
with GNNs, over traditional ML methods, for capturing the domain specific
behavior through an extensive experimental evaluation over SCOPE big data

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[High-quality labels are expensive to obtain for many machine learning tasks,
such as medical image classification tasks. Therefore, probabilistic (weak)
labels produced by weak supervision tools are used to seed a process in which
influential samples with weak labels are identified and cleaned by several
human annotators to improve the model performance. To lower the overall cost
and computational overhead of this process, we propose a solution called
Chef(CHEap and Fast label cleaning), which consists of the following three
components. First, to reduce the cost of human annotators, we use Infl, which
prioritizes the most influential training samples for cleaning and provides
cleaned labels to save the cost of one human annotator. Second, to accelerate
the sample selector phase and the model constructor phase, we use Increm-Infl
to incrementally produce influential samples, and DeltaGrad-L to incrementally
update the model. Third, we redesign the typical label cleaning pipeline so
that human annotators iteratively clean smaller batch of samples rather than
one big batch of samples. This yields better over all model performance and
enables possible early termination when the expected model performance has been
achieved. Extensive experiments show that our approach gives good model
prediction performance while achieving significant speed-ups.]]></summary>

tool in designing and controlling the nonlinear system. There exist different
entropy measures in the literature to analyze the predictability and complexity
of time series. However, these measures have some drawbacks especially in short
time series. To overcome the difficulties, this paper proposes a new method for
estimating the entropy of a time series using the LogNNet 784:25:10 neural
network model. The LogNNet reservoir matrix consists of 19625 elements which is
filled with the time series elements. After that, the network is trained on
MNIST-10 dataset and the classification accuracy is calculated. The accuracy is
considered as the entropy measure and denoted by NNetEn. A more complex
transformation of the input information by the time series in the reservoir
leads to higher NNetEn values. Many practical time series data have less than
19625 elements. Some duplicating or stretching methods are investigated to
overcome this difficulty and the most successful method is identified for
practical applications. The epochs number in the training process of LogNNet is
considered as the input parameter. A new time series characteristic called time
series learning inertia is introduced to investigate the effect of epochs
number in the efficiency of neural network. To show the robustness and
efficiency of the proposed method, it is applied on some chaotic, periodic,
random, binary and constant time series. The NNetEn is compared with some
existing entropy measures. The results show that the proposed method is more
robust and accurate than existing methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adaptive gradient methods, especially Adam-type methods (such as Adam,
AMSGrad, and AdaBound), have been proposed to speed up the training process
with an element-wise scaling term on learning rates. However, they often
generalize poorly compared with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its
accelerated schemes such as SGD with momentum (SGDM). In this paper, we propose
a new adaptive method called DecGD, which simultaneously achieves good
generalization like SGDM and obtain rapid convergence like Adam-type methods.
In particular, DecGD decomposes the current gradient into the product of two
terms including a surrogate gradient and a loss based vector. Our method
adjusts the learning rates adaptively according to the current loss based
vector instead of the squared gradients used in Adam-type methods. The
intuition for adaptive learning rates of DecGD is that a good optimizer, in
general cases, needs to decrease the learning rates as the loss decreases,
which is similar to the learning rates decay scheduling technique. Therefore,
DecGD gets a rapid convergence in the early phases of training and controls the
effective learning rates according to the loss based vectors which help lead to
a better generalization. Convergence analysis is discussed in both convex and
non-convex situations. Finally, empirical results on widely-used tasks and
models demonstrate that DecGD shows better generalization performance than SGDM
and rapid convergence like Adam-type methods.]]></summary>

outside the research field for several reasons that make them difficult to
integrate into a typical design process. In the early design phase, in

which requires quick iteration. This research introduces a novel method for
performance-driven geometry generation that can afford interaction directly in
the 3d modeling environment, eliminating the need for explicit parametrization,
and is multiple orders faster than the equivalent form optimization. The method
uses Machine Learning techniques to train a generative model offline. The
generative model learns a distribution of optimal performing geometries and
their simulation contexts based on a dataset that addresses the performance(s)
of interest. By navigating the generative model's latent space, geometries with
the desired characteristics can be quickly generated. A case study is
presented, demonstrating the generation of a synthetic dataset and the use of a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a generative model for geometries with optimal
solar gain. The results show that the VAE-generated geometries perform on

the state-of-the-art model accuracy for various applications. However, the
enhanced accuracy comes at the cost of substantial memory bandwidth and storage
requirements and demanding computational resources. Although in the past the
quantization methods have effectively reduced the deployment cost for edge
devices, it suffers from significant information loss when processing the
biased activations of contemporary CNNs. In this paper, we hence introduce an
adaptive high-performance quantization method to resolve the issue of biased
activation by dynamically adjusting the scaling and shifting factors based on
the task loss. Our proposed method has been extensively evaluated on image
classification models (ResNet-18/34/50, MobileNet-V2, EfficientNet-B0) with
ImageNet dataset, object detection model (YOLO-V4) with COCO dataset, and
language models with PTB dataset. The results show that our 4-bit integer
(INT4) quantization models achieve better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
4-bit models, and in some cases, even surpass the golden full-precision models.
The final designs have been successfully deployed onto extremely

future states of a running business process. However, the internal mechanisms
of many existing predictive algorithms are opaque and a human decision-maker is
unable to understand \emph{why} a certain activity was predicted. Recently,
counterfactuals have been proposed in the literature to derive
human-understandable explanations from predictive models. Current
counterfactual approaches consist of finding the minimum feature change that
can make a certain prediction flip its outcome. Although many algorithms have
been proposed, their application to the sequence and multi-dimensional data
like event logs has not been explored in the literature.

In this paper, we explore the use of a recent, popular model-agnostic
counterfactual algorithm, DiCE, in the context of predictive process analytics.
The analysis reveals that the algorithm is limited when being applied to derive
explanations of process predictions, due to (1) process domain knowledge not
being taken into account, (2) long traces that often tend to be less
understandable, and (3) difficulties in optimising the counterfactual search
with categorical variables. We design an extension of DiCE that can generate
counterfactuals for process predictions, and propose an approach that supports
deriving milestone-aware counterfactuals at different stages of a trace to
promote interpretability. We apply our approach to BPIC2012 event log and the
analysis results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing board games is considered a major challenge for both humans and AI
researchers. Because some complicated board games are quite hard to learn,
humans usually begin with playing on smaller boards and incrementally advance
to master larger board strategies. Most neural network frameworks that are
currently tasked with playing board games neither perform such incremental
learning nor possess capabilities to automatically scale up. In this work, we
look at the board as a graph and combine a graph neural network architecture
inside the AlphaZero framework, along with some other innovative improvements.
Our ScalableAlphaZero is capable of learning to play incrementally on small
boards, and advancing to play on large ones. Our model can be trained quickly
to play different challenging board games on multiple board sizes, without
using any domain knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
ScalableAlphaZero and show, for example, that by training it for only three
days on small Othello boards, it can defeat the AlphaZero model on a large
board, which was trained to play the large board for $30$ days.]]></summary>

for ranking and revenue improvement. Industrial ensemble models are typically
deep neural networks, following the supervised learning paradigm to infer
conversion rate given inputs from sub-models. However, this process has the
following two problems. Firstly, the point-wise scoring approach disregards the
relationships between items and leads to homogeneous displayed results, while
diversified display benefits user experience and revenue. Secondly, the
learning paradigm focuses on the ranking metrics and does not directly optimize
the revenue. In our work, we propose a new Learning-To-Ensemble (LTE) framework
RAEGO, which replaces the ensemble model with a contextual Rank Aggregator (RA)
and explores the best weights of sub-models by the Evaluator-Generator
Optimization (EGO). To achieve the best online performance, we propose a new
rank aggregation algorithm TournamentGreedy as a refinement of classic rank
aggregators, which also produces the best average weighted Kendall Tau Distance
(KTD) amongst all the considered algorithms with quadratic time complexity.
Under the assumption that the best output list should be Pareto Optimal on the
KTD metric for sub-models, we show that our RA algorithm has higher efficiency
and coverage in exploring the optimal weights. Combined with the idea of
Bayesian Optimization and gradient descent, we solve the online contextual
Black-Box Optimization task that finds the optimal weights for sub-models given
a chosen RA model. RA-EGO has been deployed in our online system and has
improved the revenue significantly.]]></summary>

systems such as online advertising, for which contextual bandit algorithms have
been proposed. Bayesian approaches provide guided exploration with principled
uncertainty estimation, but the applicability is often limited due to
over-simplified assumptions. Non-Bayesian bootstrap methods, on the other hand,
can apply to complex problems by using deep reward models, but lacks clear
guidance to the exploration behavior. It still remains largely unsolved to
develop a practical method for complex deep contextual bandits.

In this paper, we introduce Guided Bootstrap (GuideBoot for short), combining
the best of both worlds. GuideBoot provides explicit guidance to the
exploration behavior by training multiple models over both real samples and
noisy samples with fake labels, where the noise is added according to the
predictive uncertainty. The proposed method is efficient as it can make
decisions on-the-fly by utilizing only one randomly chosen model, but is also
effective as we show that it can be viewed as a non-Bayesian approximation of
Thompson sampling. Moreover, we extend it to an online version that can learn
solely from streaming data, which is favored in real applications. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic task and large-scale advertising environments
show that GuideBoot achieves significant improvements against previous
state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

problems over a given time horizon to construct a tight enclosure (Tube) of the
set of all process executions starting from a ball of initial states. We call
our algorithm GoTube. Through its construction, GoTube ensures that the
bounding tube is conservative up to a desired probability. GoTube is
implemented in JAX and optimized to scale to complex continuous-depth models.
Compared to advanced reachability analysis tools for time-continuous neural
networks, GoTube provably does not accumulate over-approximation errors between
time steps and avoids the infamous wrapping effect inherent in symbolic
techniques. We show that GoTube substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
verification tools in terms of the size of the initial ball, speed,

architectural design team during the early design phase. However, architects
and engineers do not typically work together during the conceptual phase; in
fact, structural engineers are often called late into the process. As a result,
updates in the design are more difficult and time-consuming to complete. At the
same time, there is a lost opportunity for better design exploration guided by
structural feedback. In general, the earlier in the design process the
iteration happens, the greater the benefits in cost efficiency and informed
de-sign exploration, which can lead to higher-quality creative results. In
order to facilitate an informed exploration in the early design stage, we
suggest the automation of fundamental structural engineering tasks and
introduce ApproxiFramer, a Machine Learning-based system for the automatic
generation of structural layouts from building plan sketches in real-time. The
system aims to assist architects by presenting them with feasible structural
solutions during the conceptual phase so that they proceed with their design
with adequate knowledge of its structural implications. In this paper, we
describe the system and evaluate the performance of a proof-of-concept
implementation in the domain of orthogonal, metal, rigid structures. We trained
a Convolutional Neural Net to iteratively generate structural design solutions
for sketch-level building plans using a synthetic dataset and achieved an

important gap by leveraging recent development in Bayesian deep learning and
privacy accounting to offer a more precise analysis of the trade-off between
privacy and accuracy in BNN. We propose three DP-BNNs that characterize the
weight uncertainty for the same network architecture in distinct ways, namely
DP-SGLD (via the noisy gradient method), DP-BBP (via changing the parameters of
interest) and DP-MC Dropout (via the model architecture). Interestingly, we
show a new equivalence between DP-SGD and DP-SGLD, implying that some
non-Bayesian DP training naturally allows for uncertainty quantification.
However, the hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size, can have
different or even opposite effects in DP-SGD and DP-SGLD.

Extensive experiments are conducted to compare DP-BNNs, in terms of privacy
guarantee, prediction accuracy, uncertainty quantification, calibration,
computation speed, and generalizability to network architecture. As a result,
we observe a new tradeoff between the privacy and the reliability. When
compared to non-DP and non-Bayesian approaches, DP-SGLD is remarkably accurate

Bayesian machine learning applications. Often, this requires to meaningfully
attribute predictive uncertainties to source features in an image, text or
categorical array. However, popular attribution methods are particularly
designed for classification and regression scores. In order to explain
uncertainties, state of the art alternatives commonly procure counterfactual
feature vectors, and proceed by making direct comparisons. In this paper, we
leverage path integrals to attribute uncertainties in Bayesian differentiable
models. We present a novel algorithm that relies on in-distribution curves
connecting a feature vector to some counterfactual counterpart, and we retain
desirable properties of interpretability methods. We validate our approach on
benchmark image data sets with varying resolution, and show that it
significantly simplifies interpretability over the existing alternatives.]]></summary>

the instance-level local discrimination of the given unlabeled images by
exploring various negative data. However, the existed sample outliers which
exhibit large intra-class divergences or small inter-class variations severely
limit their learning performance. We justify that the performance limitation is
caused by the gradient vanishing on these sample outliers. Moreover, the
shortage of positive data and disregard for global discrimination consideration
also pose critical issues for unsupervised learning but are always ignored by
existing methods. To handle these issues, we propose a novel solution to
explicitly model and directly explore the uncertainty of the given unlabeled
learning samples. Instead of learning a deterministic feature point for each
sample in the embedding space, we propose to represent a sample by a stochastic
Gaussian with the mean vector depicting its space localization and covariance
vector representing the sample uncertainty. We leverage such uncertainty
modeling as momentum to the learning which is helpful to tackle the outliers.
Furthermore, abundant positive candidates can be readily drawn from the learned
instance-specific distributions which are further adopted to mitigate the
aforementioned issues. Thorough rationale analyses and extensive experiments
are presented to verify our superiority.]]></summary>

restrictions on data availability. To still obtain viable models, continual
learning aims to train in sequential order, as and when data is available. The
main challenge that continual learning methods face is to prevent catastrophic
forgetting, i.e., a decrease in performance on the data encountered earlier.
This issue makes continuous training of segmentation models for medical
applications extremely difficult. Yet, often, data from at least two different
domains is available which we can exploit to train the model in a way that it
disregards domain-specific information. We propose an architecture that
leverages the simultaneous availability of two or more datasets to learn a
disentanglement between the content and domain in an adversarial fashion. The
domain-invariant content representation then lays the base for continual
semantic segmentation. Our approach takes inspiration from domain adaptation
and combines it with continual learning for hippocampal segmentation in brain
MRI. We showcase that our method reduces catastrophic forgetting and
outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods.]]></summary>

its malignancy, it is graded by a pathologist into three grades according to
WHO standards. This grade plays a decisive role in treatment, and yet may be
subject to inter-rater discordance. In this work, we present and compare three
approaches towards fully automatic meningioma grading from histology whole
slide images. All approaches are following a two-stage paradigm, where we first
identify a region of interest based on the detection of mitotic figures in the
slide using a state-of-the-art object detection deep learning network. This
region of highest mitotic rate is considered characteristic for biological
tumor behavior. In the second stage, we calculate a score corresponding to
tumor malignancy based on information contained in this region using three
different settings. In a first approach, image patches are sampled from this
region and regression is based on morphological features encoded by a
ResNet-based network. We compare this to learning a logistic regression from
the determined mitotic count, an approach which is easily traceable and
explainable. Lastly, we combine both approaches in a single network. We trained
the pipeline on 951 slides from 341 patients and evaluated them on a separate
set of 141 slides from 43 patients. All approaches yield a high correlation to
the WHO grade. The logistic regression and the combined approach had the best
results in our experiments, yielding correct predictions in 32 and 33 of all
cases, respectively, with the image-based approach only predicting 25 cases
correctly. Spearman's correlation was 0.716, 0.792 and 0.790 respectively. It
may seem counterintuitive at first that morphological features provided by
image patches do not improve model performance. Yet, this mirrors the criteria
of the grading scheme, where mitotic count is the only unequivocal parameter.]]></summary>

aerial images captured in different environments. Estimating the precise
transformation parameters is hindered by various environments such as time,

composed of a straight line owing to building and road. Therefore, the straight
lines are distorted when estimating homography parameters directly between two
images. In this paper, we propose a deep homography alignment network to
precisely match two aerial images by progressively estimating the various
transformation parameters. The proposed network is possible to train the
matching network with a higher degree of freedom by progressively analyzing the
transformation parameters. The precision matching performances have been
increased by applying homography transformation. In addition, we introduce a
method that can effectively learn the difficult-to-learn homography estimation
network. Since there is no published learning data for aerial image
registration, in this paper, a pair of images to which random homography
transformation is applied within a certain range is used for learning. Hence,
we could confirm that the deep homography alignment network shows high
precision matching performance compared with conventional works.]]></summary>

pixel-wise similarity learning to set-wise one to improve the robustness

resorting to attentional features of views, we establish corresponding sets,
thus filtering out noisy backgrounds that may cause incorrect correspondences.
Meanwhile, these attentional features can keep the coherence of the same image
across different views to alleviate semantic inconsistency. We further search
the cross-view nearest neighbours of sets and employ the structured
neighbourhood information to enhance the robustness. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that SetSim is superior to state-of-the-art methods on object

consume point clouds of fixed size directly. By analysis of PointNet, a pioneer
in introducing deep learning into point sets, we reveal that current
point-based methods are essentially spatial relationship processing networks.
In this paper, we take a different approach. Our architecture, named PE-Net,
learns the representation of point clouds in high-dimensional space, and
encodes the unordered input points to feature vectors, which standard 2D CNNs
can be applied to. The recommended network can adapt to changes in the number
of input points which is the limit of current methods. Experiments show that in
the tasks of classification and part segmentation, PE-Net achieves the

state-of-the-art results across a large scale range of models: For YOLO-Nano
with only 0.91M parameters and 1.08G FLOPs, we get 25.3% AP on COCO, surpassing
NanoDet by 1.8% AP; for YOLOv3, one of the most widely used detectors in
industry, we boost it to 47.3% AP on COCO, outperforming the current best

YOLOv4-CSP, YOLOv5-L, we achieve 50.0% AP on COCO at a speed of 68.9 FPS on
Tesla V100, exceeding YOLOv5-L by 1.8% AP. Further, we won the 1st Place on

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We propose an approach to instance segmentation from 3D point clouds based on
dynamic convolution. This enables it to adapt, at inference, to varying feature
and object scales. Doing so avoids some pitfalls of bottom up approaches,
including a dependence on hyper-parameter tuning and heuristic post-processing
pipelines to compensate for the inevitable variability in object sizes, even
within a single scene. The representation capability of the network is greatly
improved by gathering homogeneous points that have identical semantic
categories and close votes for the geometric centroids. Instances are then
decoded via several simple convolution layers, where the parameters are
generated conditioned on the input. The proposed approach is proposal-free, and
instead exploits a convolution process that adapts to the spatial and semantic
characteristics of each instance. A light-weight transformer, built on the
bottleneck layer, allows the model to capture long-range dependencies, with
limited computational overhead. The result is a simple, efficient, and robust
approach that yields strong performance on various datasets: ScanNetV2, S3DIS,
and PartNet. The consistent improvements on both voxel- and point-based
architectures imply the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As one of the prevalent components, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is widely
used in the current object detection models to improve the performance of
multi-scale detection. However, its interaction is still in a local and lossy
manner, thus limiting the representation power. In this paper, to simulate a
global view of human vision in object detection and address the inherent
defects of interaction mode in FPN, we construct a novel architecture termed
Content-Augmented Feature Pyramid Network (CA-FPN). Unlike the vanilla FPN,
which fuses features within a local receptive field, CA-FPN can adaptively
aggregate similar features from a global view. It is equipped with a global
content extraction module and light linear spatial transformers. The former
allows to extract multi-scale context information and the latter can deeply
combine the global content extraction module with the vanilla FPN using the
linearized attention function, which is designed to reduce model complexity.
Furthermore, CA-FPN can be readily plugged into existing FPN-based models.
Extensive experiments on the challenging COCO and PASCAL VOC object detection
datasets demonstrated that our CA-FPN significantly outperforms competitive
FPN-based detectors without bells and whistles. When plugging CA-FPN into
Cascade R-CNN framework built upon a standard ResNet-50 backbone, our method
can achieve 44.8 AP on COCO mini-val. Its performance surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art by 1.5 AP, demonstrating the potentiality of application.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guided depth super-resolution is a practical task where a low-resolution and
noisy input depth map is restored to a high-resolution version, with the help
of a high-resolution RGB guide image. Existing methods usually view this task
as a generalized guided filtering problem that relies on designing explicit
filters and objective functions, or a dense regression problem that directly
predicts the target image via deep neural networks. These methods suffer from
either model capability or interpretability. Inspired by the recent progress in
implicit neural representation, we propose to formulate the guided
super-resolution as a neural implicit image interpolation problem, where we
take the form of a general image interpolation but use a novel Joint Implicit
Image Function (JIIF) representation to learn both the interpolation weights
and values. JIIF represents the target image domain with spatially distributed
local latent codes extracted from the input image and the guide image, and uses
a graph attention mechanism to learn the interpolation weights at the same time
in one unified deep implicit function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
JIIF representation on guided depth super-resolution task, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art methods on three public benchmarks. Code can be

on unseen target domains with different statistics, is a challenging problem.
While many approaches have been proposed to solve this problem, they only
utilize source data during training but do not take advantage of the fact that
a single target example is available at the time of inference. Motivated by
this, we propose a method that effectively uses the target sample during
inference beyond mere classification. Our method has three components - (i) A
label-preserving feature or metric transformation on source data such that the
source samples are clustered in accordance with their class irrespective of
their domain (ii) A generative model trained on the these features (iii) A
label-preserving projection of the target point on the source-feature manifold
during inference via solving an optimization problem on the input space of the
generative model using the learned metric. Finally, the projected target is
used in the classifier. Since the projected target feature comes from the
source manifold and has the same label as the real target by design, the
classifier is expected to perform better on it than the true target. We
demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art Domain
Generalization methods on multiple datasets and tasks.]]></summary>

ideally from several sources. However, these datasets cannot be combined easily
because of patient privacy concerns or regulatory hurdles, especially if
medical data is involved. Federated learning (FL) is a way to train machine
learning models without the need for centralized datasets. Each FL client
trains on their local data while only sharing model parameters with a global
server that aggregates the parameters from all clients. At the same time, each
client's data can exhibit differences and inconsistencies due to the local
variation in the patient population, imaging equipment, and acquisition
protocols. Hence, the federated learned models should be able to adapt to the
local particularities of a client's data. In this work, we combine FL with an
AutoML technique based on local neural architecture search by training a
"supernet". Furthermore, we propose an adaptation scheme to allow for
personalized model architectures at each FL client's site. The proposed method
is evaluated on four different datasets from 3D prostate MRI and shown to
improve the local models' performance after adaptation through selecting an
optimal path through the AutoML supernet.]]></summary>

summary of disease-related information about patients. Such coding is usually
done manually in hospitals but could potentially be automated to improve the
efficiency and accuracy of medical coding. Recent studies on deep learning for
automated medical coding achieved promising performances. However, the
explainability of these models is usually poor, preventing them to be used
confidently in supporting clinical practice. Another limitation is that these
models mostly assume independence among labels, ignoring the complex
correlation among medical codes which can potentially be exploited to improve
the performance. We propose a Hierarchical Label-wise Attention Network (HLAN),
which aimed to interpret the model by quantifying importance (as attention
weights) of words and sentences related to each of the labels. Secondly, we
propose to enhance the major deep learning models with a label embedding (LE)
initialisation approach, which learns a dense, continuous vector representation
and then injects the representation into the final layers and the label-wise
attention layers in the models. We evaluated the methods using three settings
on the MIMIC-III discharge summaries: full codes, top-50 codes, and the UK NHS
COVID-19 shielding codes. Experiments were conducted to compare HLAN and LE
initialisation to the state-of-the-art neural network based methods. HLAN
achieved the best Micro-level AUC and $F_1$ on the top-50 code prediction and
comparable results on the NHS COVID-19 shielding code prediction to other
models. By highlighting the most salient words and sentences for each label,
HLAN showed more meaningful and comprehensive model interpretation compared to
its downgraded baselines and the CNN-based models. LE initialisation
consistently boosted most deep learning models for automated medical coding.]]></summary>

timepoint scans acquired upon disease presentation or admission. We present a
deep learning-based approach to predict lung infiltrate progression from serial
chest radiographs (CXRs) of COVID-19 patients. Our method first utilizes
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from patches within
the concerned lung zone, and also from neighboring and remote boundary regions.
The framework further incorporates a multi-scale Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
with a correlation module for effective predictions. The GRU accepts CNN
feature vectors from three different areas as input and generates a fused
representation. The correlation module attempts to minimize the correlation
loss between hidden representations of concerned and neighboring area feature
vectors, while maximizing the loss between the same from concerned and remote
regions. Further, we employ an attention module over the output hidden states
of each encoder timepoint to generate a context vector. This vector is used as
an input to a decoder module to predict patch severity grades at a future
timepoint. Finally, we ensemble the patch classification scores to calculate
patient-wise grades. Specifically, our framework predicts zone-wise disease
severity for a patient on a given day by learning representations from the
previous temporal CXRs. Our novel multi-institutional dataset comprises
sequential CXR scans from N=93 patients. Our approach outperforms transfer

data and obtain products with multiple data advantages. To solves the problem
of reduced resolution of PolSAR images due to system limitations, we propose a
fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images and
single-polarization synthetic aperture radar SAR (SinSAR) images fusion network
to generate high-resolution PolSAR (HR-PolSAR) images. To take advantage of the
polarimetric information of the low-resolution PolSAR (LR-PolSAR) image and the
spatial information of the high-resolution single-polarization SAR (HR-SinSAR)
image, we propose a fusion framework for joint LR-PolSAR image and HR-SinSAR
image and design a cross-attention mechanism to extract features from the joint
input data. Besides, based on the physical imaging mechanism, we designed the
PolSAR polarimetric loss function for constrained network training. The
experimental results confirm the superiority of fusion network over traditional
algorithms. The average PSNR is increased by more than 3.6db, and the average
MAE is reduced to less than 0.07. Experiments on polarimetric decomposition and
polarimetric signature show that it maintains polarimetric information well.]]></summary>

aims at localizing temporal intervals containing human actions in untrimmed

definition that a human, known as an agent, interacts with the environment and
performs an action that affects the environment, we propose a contextual
Agent-Environment Network. Our proposed contextual AEN involves (i) agent
pathway, operating at a local level to tell about which humans/agents are
acting and (ii) environment pathway operating at a global level to tell about
how the agents interact with the environment. Comprehensive evaluations on
20-action THUMOS-14 and 200-action ActivityNet-1.3 datasets with different

and machine learning. This is in part due to the increasing number of important
tasks such as meta-learning, clustering, and anomaly detection that are defined
on set inputs. These networks must take an arbitrary number of input samples
and produce the output invariant to the input set permutation. Several
algorithms have been recently developed to address this urgent need. Our paper
analyzes these algorithms using both synthetic and real-world datasets, and
shows that they are not effective in dealing with common data variations such
as image translation or viewpoint change. To address this limitation, we
propose a permutation-invariant cascaded attentional set operator (PICASO). The
gist of PICASO is a cascade of multihead attention blocks with dynamic
templates. The proposed operator is a stand-alone module that can be adapted
and extended to serve different machine learning tasks. We demonstrate the
utilities of PICASO in four diverse scenarios: (i) clustering, (ii) image
classification under novel viewpoints, (iii) image anomaly detection, and (iv)
state prediction. PICASO increases the SmallNORB image classification accuracy
with novel viewpoints by about 10% points. For set anomaly detection on CelebA
dataset, our model improves the areas under ROC and PR curves dataset by about
22% and 10%, respectively. For the state prediction on CLEVR dataset, it
improves the AP by about 40%.]]></summary>

techniques targeted for fisheye camera perception. Due to strong radial
distortion standard models don't generalize well to fisheye images and hence
the deformations in the visual appearance of objects and entities needs to be
encoded implicitly or as explicit knowledge. This challenge served as a medium
to investigate the challenges and new methodologies to handle the complexities
with perception on fisheye images. The challenge was hosted on CodaLab and used
the recently released WoodScape dataset comprising of 10k samples. In this
paper, we provide a summary of the competition which attracted the
participation of 71 global teams and a total of 395 submissions. The top teams
recorded significantly improved mean IoU and accuracy scores over the baseline

correctly infer the generative factors of variation in simple datasets
(dSprites, Shapes3D, MPI3D). In contrast to prior robustness work that
introduces novel factors of variation during test time, such as blur or other

existing factors of variation from the training data set (e.g., small and

that learn the correct mechanism should be able to generalize to this
benchmark. In total, we train and test 2000+ models and observe that all of
them struggle to learn the underlying mechanism regardless of supervision
signal and architectural bias. Moreover, the generalization capabilities of all
tested models drop significantly as we move from artificial datasets towards
more realistic real-world datasets. Despite their inability to identify the
correct mechanism, the models are quite modular as their ability to infer other

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) is to retrieve images of the same vehicle
across different cameras. Two key challenges lie in the subtle inter-instance
discrepancy caused by near-duplicate identities and the large intra-instance
variance caused by different views. Since the holistic appearance suffers from
viewpoint variation and distortion, part-level feature learning has been
introduced to enhance vehicle description. However, existing approaches to
localize and amplify significant parts often fail to handle spatial
misalignment as well as occlusion and require expensive annotations. In this
paper, we propose a weakly supervised Part-Mentored Attention Network (PMANet)
composed of a Part Attention Network (PANet) for vehicle part localization with
self-attention and a Part-Mentored Network (PMNet) for mentoring the global and
local feature aggregation. Firstly, PANet is introduced to predict a foreground
mask and pinpoint $K$ prominent vehicle parts only with weak identity
supervision. Secondly, we propose a PMNet to learn global and part-level
features with multi-scale attention and aggregate them in $K$ main-partial
tasks via part transfer. Like humans who first differentiate objects with
general information and then observe salient parts for more detailed clues,
PANet and PMNet construct a two-stage attention structure to perform a
coarse-to-fine search among identities. Finally, we address this Re-ID issue as
a multi-task problem, including global feature learning, identity
classification, and part transfer. We adopt Homoscedastic Uncertainty to learn
the optimal weighing of different losses. Comprehensive experiments are
conducted on two benchmark datasets. Our approach outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods by averagely 2.63% in CMC@1 on VehicleID and 2.2% in
mAP on VeRi776. Results on occluded test sets also demonstrate the
generalization ability of PMANet.]]></summary>

of region attention is an important factor, which has been explored a lot by
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based approaches. The recently developed
vision transformer (ViT) has achieved promising results on computer vision
tasks. Compared with CNNs, Image sequentialization is a brand new manner.
However, ViT is limited in its receptive field size and thus lacks local
attention like CNNs due to the fixed size of its patches, and is unable to
generate multi-scale features to learn discriminative region attention. To
facilitate the learning of discriminative region attention without box/part
annotations, we use the strength of the attention weights to measure the
importance of the patch tokens corresponding to the raw images. We propose the
recurrent attention multi-scale transformer (RAMS-Trans), which uses the
transformer's self-attention to recursively learn discriminative region
attention in a multi-scale manner. Specifically, at the core of our approach
lies the dynamic patch proposal module (DPPM) guided region amplification to
complete the integration of multi-scale image patches. The DPPM starts with the
full-size image patches and iteratively scales up the region attention to
generate new patches from global to local by the intensity of the attention
weights generated at each scale as an indicator. Our approach requires only the
attention weights that come with ViT itself and can be easily trained
end-to-end. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAMS-Trans performs better
than concurrent works, in addition to efficient CNN models, achieving
state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets.]]></summary>

networks have direct parallels in finite state machines, allowing clear
discussion and thought around architecture variants or trained models,
Transformers have no such familiar parallel. In this paper we aim to change
that, proposing a computational model for the transformer-encoder in the form
of a programming language. We map the basic components of a transformer-encoder
-- attention and feed-forward computation -- into simple primitives, around
which we form a programming language: the Restricted Access Sequence Processing
Language (RASP). We show how RASP can be used to program solutions to tasks
that could conceivably be learned by a Transformer, and how a Transformer can
be trained to mimic a RASP solution. In particular, we provide RASP programs
for histograms, sorting, and Dyck-languages. We further use our model to relate
their difficulty in terms of the number of required layers and attention heads:
analyzing a RASP program implies a maximum number of heads and layers necessary
to encode a task in a transformer. Finally, we see how insights gained from our
abstraction might be used to explain phenomena seen in recent works.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[End-to-end spoken language understanding (SLU) has recently attracted
increasing interest. Compared to the conventional tandem-based approach that
combines speech recognition and language understanding as separate modules, the
new approach extracts users' intentions directly from the speech signals,
resulting in joint optimization and low latency. Such an approach, however, is
typically designed to process one intention at a time, which leads users to
take multiple rounds to fulfill their requirements while interacting with a
dialogue system. In this paper, we propose a streaming end-to-end framework
that can process multiple intentions in an online and incremental way. The
backbone of our framework is a unidirectional RNN trained with the
connectionist temporal classification (CTC) criterion. By this design, an
intention can be identified when sufficient evidence has been accumulated, and
multiple intentions can be identified sequentially. We evaluate our solution on
the Fluent Speech Commands (FSC) dataset and the intent detection accuracy is
about 97 % on all multi-intent settings. This result is comparable to the
performance of the state-of-the-art non-streaming models, but is achieved in an
online and incremental way. We also employ our model to a keyword spotting task
using the Google Speech Commands dataset and the results are also highly
promising.]]></summary>

emerges from a requirement that the CNNs generate informative data. We propose
a technique to wug-test CNNs trained on speech and, based on four generative

its latent space. By manipulating only two categorical variables in the latent
space, we can actively turn an unreduplicated form into a reduplicated form
with no other substantial changes to the output in the majority of cases. We
also argue that the network extends the identity-based pattern to unobserved

emerge in CNNs and how the latent space variables outside of the training range
correlate with identity-based patterns in the output has general implications
for neural network interpretability.]]></summary>

recently. A fundamental question we'd like to address is: where did the
generated text come from? This work is our initial effort toward answering the
question by using prior art search. The purpose of the prior art search is to
find the most similar prior text in the training data of GPT-2. We take a
reranking approach and apply it to the patent domain. Specifically, we
pre-train GPT-2 models from scratch by using the patent data from the USPTO.
The input for the prior art search is the patent text generated by the GPT-2
model. We also pre-trained BERT models from scratch for converting patent text
to embeddings. The steps of reranking are: (1) search the most similar text in
the training data of GPT-2 by taking a bag-of-word ranking approach (BM25), (2)
convert the search results in text format to BERT embeddings, and (3) provide
the final result by ranking the BERT embeddings based on their similarities
with the patent text generated by GPT-2. The experiments in this work show that
such reranking is better than ranking with embeddings alone. However, our mixed
results also indicate that calculating the semantic similarities among long
text spans is still challenging. To our knowledge, this work is the first to
implement a reranking system to identify retrospectively the most similar
inputs to a GPT model based on its output.]]></summary>

level. The first challenge is solved with a splicing data method which
concatenates the speech segments extracted from the source domain data. To get
the time stamp, a phone prediction branch is added to the RNN-T model by
sharing the encoder for the purpose of force alignment. Finally, we obtain
word-level confidence scores by utilizing several types of features calculated
during decoding and from confusion network. Evaluated with Microsoft production
data, the splicing data adaptation method improves the baseline and adaptation
with the text to speech method by 58.03% and 15.25% relative word error rate

two independent physicians using a standardized approach. The multilayer
perceptron neural network outperforms other discriminative and generative

classification performance with 89 % accuracy, 88 % recall, and 89 % precision.
Furthermore, a generative autoencoder learning algorithm was proposed to

subtitles in multilingual events is more relevant than ever. In an attempt to
automatise the process, we aim at exploring the feasibility of simultaneous
speech translation (SimulST) for live subtitling. However, the word-for-word
rate of generation of SimulST systems is not optimal for displaying the
subtitles in a comprehensible and readable way. In this work, we adapt SimulST
systems to predict subtitle breaks along with the translation. We then propose
a display mode that exploits the predicted break structure by presenting the
subtitles in scrolling lines. We compare our proposed mode with a display 1)
word-for-word and 2) in blocks, in terms of reading speed and delay.
Experiments on three language pairs (en$\rightarrow$it, de, fr) show that
scrolling lines is the only mode achieving an acceptable reading speed while
keeping delay close to a 4-second threshold. We argue that simultaneous
translation for readable live subtitles still faces challenges, the main one
being poor translation quality, and propose directions for steering future
research.]]></summary>

multiple communication channels such as verbal content (i.e., text), voice, and
facial expressions. It has become a vibrant and important research topic in
natural language processing. Much research focuses on modeling the complex
intra- and inter-modal interactions between different communication channels.
However, current multimodal models with strong performance are often
deep-learning-based techniques and work like black boxes. It is not clear how
models utilize multimodal information for sentiment predictions. Despite recent
advances in techniques for enhancing the explainability of machine learning
models, they often target unimodal scenarios (e.g., images, sentences), and
little research has been done on explaining multimodal models. In this paper,
we present an interactive visual analytics system, M2Lens, to visualize and
explain multimodal models for sentiment analysis. M2Lens provides explanations
on intra- and inter-modal interactions at the global, subset, and local levels.
Specifically, it summarizes the influence of three typical interaction types
(i.e., dominance, complement, and conflict) on the model predictions. Moreover,
M2Lens identifies frequent and influential multimodal features and supports the
multi-faceted exploration of model behaviors from language, acoustic, and
visual modalities. Through two case studies and expert interviews, we
demonstrate our system can help users gain deep insights into the multimodal
models for sentiment analysis.]]></summary>

quantitative imaging method that involves a two-step process: (i)
reconstructing a series of time frames from highly-undersampled non-Cartesian
spiral k-space data and (ii) pattern matching using the time frames to infer
tissue properties (e.g., T1 and T2 relaxation times). In this paper, we
introduce a novel end-to-end deep learning framework to seamlessly map the
tissue properties directly from spiral k-space MRF data, thereby avoiding
time-consuming processing such as the nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT)
and the dictionary-based Fingerprint matching. Our method directly consumes the
non-Cartesian k- space data, performs adaptive density compensation, and
predicts multiple tissue property maps in one forward pass. Experiments on both
2D and 3D MRF data demonstrate that quantification accuracy comparable to
state-of-the-art methods can be accomplished within 0.5 second, which is 1100
to 7700 times faster than the original MRF framework. The proposed method is
thus promising for facilitating the adoption of MRF in clinical settings.]]></summary>

bidding system is becoming paramount for the success of e-commerce companies.
The critical challenges faced by a modern industrial-level bidding system
include: 1. the catalog is enormous, and the relevant bidding features are of
high sparsity; 2. the large volume of bidding requests induces significant
computation burden to both the offline and online serving. Leveraging
extraneous user-item information proves essential to mitigate the sparsity
issue, for which we exploit the natural language signals from the users' query
and the contextual knowledge from the products. In particular, we extract the
vector representations of ads via the Transformer model and leverage their
geometric relation to building collaborative bidding predictions via
clustering. The two-step procedure also significantly reduces the computation
stress of bid evaluation and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the
end-to-end structure of the bidding system for search engine marketing for
Walmart e-commerce, which successfully handles tens of millions of bids each
day. We analyze the online and offline performances of our approach and discuss
how we find it as a production-efficient solution.]]></summary>

image pair in an extreme setting, where the images have little or no overlap.
We observe that, even when images do not overlap, there may be rich hidden cues
as to their geometric relationship, such as light source directions, vanishing
points, and symmetries present in the scene. We propose a network design that
can automatically learn such implicit cues by comparing all pairs of points
between the two input images. Our method therefore constructs dense feature
correlation volumes and processes these to predict relative 3D rotations. Our
predictions are formed over a fine-grained discretization of rotations,
bypassing difficulties associated with regressing 3D rotations. We demonstrate
our approach on a large variety of extreme RGB image pairs, including indoor
and outdoor images captured under different lighting conditions and geographic
locations. Our evaluation shows that our model can successfully estimate
relative rotations among non-overlapping images without compromising
performance over overlapping image pairs.]]></summary>

train-loss hacking, which is a source of overfitting caused by a typical

novel self-supervised method to estimate this prior efficiently by combining a
Bayesian estimation framework and new stopping criteria. Our method iteratively
estimates appropriate class priors and yields high segmentation quality for a

culture, and day-to-day conversations by millions of ordinary people at a scale
that is scarcely conventionalized and recorded. Vitally, and absent from many
standard corpora such as books and news archives, sharing and commenting
mechanisms are native to social media platforms, enabling us to quantify social
amplification (i.e., popularity) of trending storylines and contemporary
cultural phenomena. Here, we describe Storywrangler, a natural language
processing instrument designed to carry out an ongoing, day-scale curation of
over 100 billion tweets containing roughly 1 trillion 1-grams from 2008 to
2021. For each day, we break tweets into unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams
spanning over 100 languages. We track n-gram usage frequencies, and generate
Zipf distributions, for words, hashtags, handles, numerals, symbols, and
emojis. We make the data set available through an interactive time series
viewer, and as downloadable time series and daily distributions. Although
Storywrangler leverages Twitter data, our method of extracting and tracking
dynamic changes of n-grams can be extended to any similar social media
platform. We showcase a few examples of the many possible avenues of study we
aim to enable including how social amplification can be visualized through
'contagiograms'. We also present some example case studies that bridge n-gram
time series with disparate data sources to explore sociotechnical dynamics of
famous individuals, box office success, and social unrest.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epistemic Planning (EP) refers to an automated planning setting where the
agent reasons in the space of knowledge states and tries to find a plan to
reach a desirable state from the current state. Its general form, the
Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) problem involves multiple agents who need
to reason about both the state of the world and the information flow between
agents. In a MEP problem, multiple approaches have been developed recently with
varying restrictions, such as considering only the concept of knowledge while
not allowing the idea of belief, or not allowing for ``complex" modal operators
such as those needed to handle dynamic common knowledge. While the diversity of
approaches has led to a deeper understanding of the problem space, the lack of
a standardized way to specify MEP problems independently of solution approaches
has created difficulties in comparing performance of planners, identifying
promising techniques, exploring new strategies like ensemble methods, and
making it easy for new researchers to contribute to this research area. To
address the situation, we propose a unified way of specifying EP problems - the
Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language, E-PDDL. We show that E-PPDL can
be supported by leading MEP planners and provide corresponding parser code that
translates EP problems specified in E-PDDL into (M)EP problems that can be
handled by several planners. This work is also useful in building more general
epistemic planning environments where we envision a meta-cognitive module that
takes a planning problem in E-PDDL, identifies and assesses some of its
features, and autonomously decides which planner is the best one to solve it.]]></summary>

Also, compiling a handcrafted and curated domain-specific knowledge base for

to automatically mine and leverage domain-specific knowledge for classifying
objects and attribute coreferences. The approach extracts domain-specific
knowledge from unlabeled review data and trains a knowledgeaware neural

well-studied task in natural language understanding (NLU). However, many of
these relationships are evident only at the level of the document, as a role

while accelerating learning progress on subsequent tasks. Specifically, TPEM
(i) leverages network pruning to keep the knowledge for old tasks, (ii) adopts
network expanding to create free weights for new tasks, and (iii) introduces
task-specific network masking to alleviate the negative impact of fixed weights
of old tasks on new tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on seven different

significantly improved results over the strong competitors. For

high-quality MRC models still requires large-scale labeled training data, even
using strong pre-trained language models (PLMs). The pre-training tasks for
PLMs are not question-answering or MRC-based tasks, making existing PLMs unable
to be directly used for unsupervised MRC. Specifically, MRC aims to spot an
accurate answer span from the given document, but PLMs focus on token filling
in sentences. In this paper, we propose a new framework for unsupervised MRC.
Firstly, we propose to learn to spot answer spans in documents via
self-supervised learning, by designing a self-supervision pretext task for MRC
- Spotting-MLM. Solving this task requires capturing deep interactions between
sentences in documents. Secondly, we apply a simple sentence rewriting strategy
in the inference stage to alleviate the expression mismatch between questions

-- a successful use of humor requires a mixture of both engaging content
build-up and an appropriate vocal delivery (e.g., pause). Prior studies on
computational humor emphasize the textual and audio features immediately next
to the punchline, yet overlooking longer-term context setup. Moreover, the
theories are usually too abstract for understanding each concrete humor
snippet. To fill in the gap, we develop DeHumor, a visual analytical system for
analyzing humorous behaviors in public speaking. To intuitively reveal the
building blocks of each concrete example, DeHumor decomposes each humorous
video into multimodal features and provides inline annotations of them on the
video script. In particular, to better capture the build-ups, we introduce
content repetition as a complement to features introduced in theories of
computational humor and visualize them in a context linking graph. To help
users locate the punchlines that have the desired features to learn, we
summarize the content (with keywords) and humor feature statistics on an
augmented time matrix. With case studies on stand-up comedy shows and TED
talks, we show that DeHumor is able to highlight various building blocks of
humor examples. In addition, expert interviews with communication coaches and
humor researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of DeHumor for multimodal humor
analysis of speech content and vocal delivery.]]></summary>

the reality we live. Each of these styles has its own set of subjective
properties, such as rhyme and rhythm, which are easily caught by a human
reader's eye and ear. With the recent advances in artificial intelligence, the
gap between humans and machines may have decreased, and today we observe
algorithms mastering tasks that were once exclusively performed by humans. In
this paper, we propose an automated method to distinguish between poetry and
prose based solely on aural and rhythmic properties. In other to compare prose
and poetry rhythms, we represent the rhymes and phones as temporal sequences
and thus we propose a procedure for extracting rhythmic features from these
sequences. The classification of the considered texts using the set of features
extracted resulted in a best accuracy of 0.78, obtained with a neural network.
Interestingly, by using an approach based on complex networks to visualize the
similarities between the different texts considered, we found that the patterns
of poetry vary much more than prose. Consequently, a much richer and complex
set of rhythmic possibilities tends to be found in that modality.]]></summary>

However, its resource-intensive nature makes it challenging to implement on
constrained embedded devices, particularly where available hardware resources
can vary at run-time. We propose a dynamic machine translation model that
scales the Transformer architecture based on the available resources at any
particular time. The proposed approach, 'Dynamic-HAT', uses a HAT
SuperTransformer as the backbone to search for SubTransformers with different
accuracy-latency trade-offs at design time. The optimal SubTransformers are
sampled from the SuperTransformer at run-time, depending on latency
constraints. The Dynamic-HAT is tested on the Jetson Nano and the approach uses
inherited SubTransformers sampled directly from the SuperTransformer with a
switching time of <1s. Using inherited SubTransformers results in a BLEU score
loss of <1.5% because the SubTransformer configuration is not retrained from
scratch after sampling. However, to recover this loss in performance, the
dimensions of the design space can be reduced to tailor it to a family of
target hardware. The new reduced design space results in a BLEU score increase
of approximately 1% for sub-optimal models from the original design space, with
a wide range for performance scaling between 0.356s - 1.526s for the GPU and

to generate noise-robust utterances, and similar solutions have been developed

(NMT) models with the pre-trained language models (LM) can speed up the model
training and boost the model performance. In this work, we identify a critical
side-effect of pre-training for NMT, which is due to the discrepancy between
the training objectives of LM-based pre-training and NMT. Since the LM
objective learns to reconstruct a few source tokens and copy most of them, the
pre-training initialization would affect the copying behaviors of NMT models.
We provide a quantitative analysis of copying behaviors by introducing a metric
called copying ratio, which empirically shows that pre-training based NMT
models have a larger copying ratio than the standard one. In response to this
problem, we propose a simple and effective method named copying penalty to
control the copying behaviors in decoding. Extensive experiments on both
in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks show that the copying penalty method
consistently improves translation performance by controlling copying behaviors
for pre-training based NMT models. Source code is freely available at

raw audio using a contrastive self-supervised signal. Whereas prior work has
relied on conditioning models on bottlenecks, we introduce a set of inductive
biases that exploit the natural structure of prosody to minimize timbral
information and decouple prosody from speaker representations. Despite
aggressive downsampling of the input and having no access to linguistic
information, our model performs comparably to state-of-the-art speech
representations on DAMMP, a new benchmark we introduce for spoken language
understanding. We use minimum description length probing to show that our
representations have selectively learned the subcomponents of non-timbral
prosody, and that the product quantizer naturally disentangles them without
using bottlenecks. We derive an information-theoretic definition of speech
de-identifiability and use it to demonstrate that our prosody representations
are less identifiable than other speech representations.]]></summary>

research takes cues from social science theories to develop a four dimensional
category for racism and xenophobia detection, namely stigmatization,
offensiveness, blame, and exclusion. With the aid of deep learning techniques,
this categorical detection enables insights into the nuances of emergent topics
reflected in racist and xenophobic expression on Twitter. Moreover, a stage
wise analysis is applied to capture the dynamic changes of the topics across
the stages of early development of Covid-19 from a domestic epidemic to an
international public health emergency, and later to a global pandemic. The main
contributions of this research include, first the methodological advancement.
By bridging the state-of-the-art computational methods with social science
perspective, this research provides a meaningful approach for future research
to gain insight into the underlying subtlety of racist and xenophobic
discussion on digital platforms. Second, by enabling a more accurate
comprehension and even prediction of public opinions and actions, this research
paves the way for the enactment of effective intervention policies to combat
racist crimes and social exclusion under Covid-19.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[High frame-corruption is widely observed in Long Range Wide Area Networks
(LoRaWAN) due to the coexistence with other networks in ISM bands and an
Aloha-like MAC layer. LoRa's Forward Error Correction (FEC) mechanism is often
insufficient to retrieve corrupted data. In fact, real-life measurements show
that at least one-fourth of received transmissions are corrupted. When more
frames are dropped, LoRa nodes usually switch over to higher spreading factors
(SF), thus increasing transmission times and increasing the required energy.
This paper introduces ReDCoS, a novel coding technique at the application layer
that improves recovery of corrupted LoRa frames, thus reducing the overall
transmission time and energy invested by LoRa nodes by several-fold. ReDCoS
utilizes lightweight coding techniques to pre-encode the transmitted data.
Therefore, the inbuilt Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) that follows is computed
based on an already encoded data. At the receiver, we use both the CRC and the
coded data to recover data from a corrupted frame beyond the built-in Error
Correcting Code (ECC). We compare the performance of ReDCoS to (I) the standard
FEC of vanilla-LoRaWAN, and to (ii) RS coding applied as ECC to the data of
LoRaWAN. The results indicated a 54x and 13.5x improvement of decoding ratio,
respectively, when 20 data symbols were sent. Furthermore, we evaluated ReDCoS
on-field using LoRa SX1261 transceivers showing that it outperformed RS-coding
by factor of at least 2x (and up to 6x) in terms of the decoding ratio while
consuming 38.5% less energy per correctly received transmission.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The exploration/exploitation (E&E) dilemma lies at the core of interactive
systems such as online advertising, for which contextual bandit algorithms have
been proposed. Bayesian approaches provide guided exploration with principled
uncertainty estimation, but the applicability is often limited due to
over-simplified assumptions. Non-Bayesian bootstrap methods, on the other hand,
can apply to complex problems by using deep reward models, but lacks clear
guidance to the exploration behavior. It still remains largely unsolved to
develop a practical method for complex deep contextual bandits.

In this paper, we introduce Guided Bootstrap (GuideBoot for short), combining
the best of both worlds. GuideBoot provides explicit guidance to the
exploration behavior by training multiple models over both real samples and
noisy samples with fake labels, where the noise is added according to the
predictive uncertainty. The proposed method is efficient as it can make
decisions on-the-fly by utilizing only one randomly chosen model, but is also
effective as we show that it can be viewed as a non-Bayesian approximation of
Thompson sampling. Moreover, we extend it to an online version that can learn
solely from streaming data, which is favored in real applications. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic task and large-scale advertising environments
show that GuideBoot achieves significant improvements against previous
state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

(DNNs), many existing DNN watermarking techniques either embed watermarks
directly into the DNN parameters or insert backdoor watermarks by fine-tuning
the DNN parameters, which, however, cannot resist against various attack
methods that remove watermarks by altering DNN parameters. In this paper, we
bypass such attacks by introducing a structural watermarking scheme that
utilizes channel pruning to embed the watermark into the host DNN architecture
instead of crafting the DNN parameters. To be specific, during watermark
embedding, we prune the internal channels of the host DNN with the channel
pruning rates controlled by the watermark. During watermark extraction, the
watermark is retrieved by identifying the channel pruning rates from the
architecture of the target DNN model. Due to the superiority of pruning
mechanism, the performance of the DNN model on its original task is reserved
during watermark embedding. Experimental results have shown that, the proposed
work enables the embedded watermark to be reliably recovered and provides a
high watermark capacity, without sacrificing the usability of the DNN model. It
is also demonstrated that the work is robust against common transforms and
attacks designed for conventional watermarking approaches.]]></summary>

not seen wide adoption for machine learning systems due to a lack of
computational interpretation. In this paper, we build on literature in machine
learning and law to propose the first learning framework for limiting data
collection based on an interpretation that ties the data collection purpose to
system performance. We formalize a data minimization criterion based on
performance curve derivatives and provide an effective and interpretable
piecewise power law technique that models distinct stages of an algorithm's
performance throughout data collection. Results from our empirical
investigation offer deeper insights into the relevant considerations when
designing a data minimization framework, including the choice of feature

Users visit these platforms and enter search queries to retrieve their desired
products. Therefore, showing the relevant products at the top is essential for
the success of e-commerce platforms. We approach this problem by learning low
dimension representations for queries and product descriptions by leveraging
user click-stream data as our main source of signal for product relevance.
Starting from GRU-based architectures as our baseline model, we move towards a
more advanced transformer-based architecture. This helps the model to learn
contextual representations of queries and products to serve better search
results and understand the user intent in an efficient manner. We perform
experiments related to pre-training of the Transformer based RoBERTa model
using a fashion corpus and fine-tuning it over the triplet loss. Our
experiments on the product ranking task show that the RoBERTa model is able to
give an improvement of 7.8% in Mean Reciprocal Rank(MRR), 15.8% in Mean Average
Precision(MAP) and 8.8% in Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain(NDCG), thus
outperforming our GRU based baselines. For the product retrieval task, RoBERTa
model is able to outperform other two models with an improvement of 164.7% in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Similar question retrieval is a core task in community-based question
answering (CQA) services. To balance the effectiveness and efficiency, the
question retrieval system is typically implemented as multi-stage rankers: The
first-stage ranker aims to recall potentially relevant questions from a large
repository, and the latter stages attempt to re-rank the retrieved results.
Most existing works on question retrieval mainly focused on the re-ranking
stages, leaving the first-stage ranker to some traditional term-based methods.
However, term-based methods often suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem,
especially on short texts, which may block the re-rankers from relevant
questions at the very beginning. An alternative is to employ embedding-based
methods for the first-stage ranker, which compress texts into dense vectors to
enhance the semantic matching. However, these methods often lose the
discriminative power as term-based methods, thus introduce noise during
retrieval and hurt the recall performance. In this work, we aim to tackle the
dilemma of the first-stage ranker, and propose a discriminative semantic
ranker, namely DenseTrans, for high-recall retrieval. Specifically, DenseTrans
is a densely connected Transformer, which learns semantic embeddings for texts
based on Transformer layers. Meanwhile, DenseTrans promotes low-level features
through dense connections to keep the discriminative power of the learned
representations. DenseTrans is inspired by DenseNet in computer vision (CV),
but poses a new way to use the dense connectivity which is totally different
from its original design purpose. Experimental results over two question
retrieval benchmark datasets show that our model can obtain significant gain on
recall against strong term-based methods as well as state-of-the-art
embedding-based methods.]]></summary>

collects and implements a wide range of popular deep learning-based methods for
face recognition. First of all, face.evoLVe is composed of key components that
cover the full process of face analytics, including face alignment, data
processing, various backbones, losses, and alternatives with bags of tricks for
improving performance. Later, face.evoLVe supports multi-GPU training on top of
different deep learning platforms, such as PyTorch and PaddlePaddle, which
facilitates researchers to work on both large-scale datasets with millions of
images and low-shot counterparts with limited well-annotated data. More
importantly, along with face.evoLVe, images before & after alignment in the
common benchmark datasets are released with source codes and trained models
provided. All these efforts lower the technical burdens in reproducing the
existing methods for comparison, while users of our library could focus on
developing advanced approaches more efficiently. Last but not least,
face.evoLVe is well designed and vibrantly evolving, so that new face
recognition approaches can be easily plugged into our framework. Note that we
have used face.evoLVe to participate in a number of face recognition
competitions and secured the first place. The version that supports PyTorch is
publicly available at https://github.com/ZhaoJ9014/face.evoLVe.PyTorch and the
PaddlePaddle version is available at
https://github.com/ZhaoJ9014/face.evoLVe.PyTorch/tree/master/paddle.
Face.evoLVe has been widely used for face analytics, receiving 2.4K stars and

multiple communication channels such as verbal content (i.e., text), voice, and
facial expressions. It has become a vibrant and important research topic in
natural language processing. Much research focuses on modeling the complex
intra- and inter-modal interactions between different communication channels.
However, current multimodal models with strong performance are often
deep-learning-based techniques and work like black boxes. It is not clear how
models utilize multimodal information for sentiment predictions. Despite recent
advances in techniques for enhancing the explainability of machine learning
models, they often target unimodal scenarios (e.g., images, sentences), and
little research has been done on explaining multimodal models. In this paper,
we present an interactive visual analytics system, M2Lens, to visualize and
explain multimodal models for sentiment analysis. M2Lens provides explanations
on intra- and inter-modal interactions at the global, subset, and local levels.
Specifically, it summarizes the influence of three typical interaction types
(i.e., dominance, complement, and conflict) on the model predictions. Moreover,
M2Lens identifies frequent and influential multimodal features and supports the
multi-faceted exploration of model behaviors from language, acoustic, and
visual modalities. Through two case studies and expert interviews, we
demonstrate our system can help users gain deep insights into the multimodal
models for sentiment analysis.]]></summary>

-- a successful use of humor requires a mixture of both engaging content
build-up and an appropriate vocal delivery (e.g., pause). Prior studies on
computational humor emphasize the textual and audio features immediately next
to the punchline, yet overlooking longer-term context setup. Moreover, the
theories are usually too abstract for understanding each concrete humor
snippet. To fill in the gap, we develop DeHumor, a visual analytical system for
analyzing humorous behaviors in public speaking. To intuitively reveal the
building blocks of each concrete example, DeHumor decomposes each humorous
video into multimodal features and provides inline annotations of them on the
video script. In particular, to better capture the build-ups, we introduce
content repetition as a complement to features introduced in theories of
computational humor and visualize them in a context linking graph. To help
users locate the punchlines that have the desired features to learn, we
summarize the content (with keywords) and humor feature statistics on an
augmented time matrix. With case studies on stand-up comedy shows and TED
talks, we show that DeHumor is able to highlight various building blocks of
humor examples. In addition, expert interviews with communication coaches and
humor researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of DeHumor for multimodal humor

learning is one of the most important research directions in Reinforcement
Learning (RL). This paper advances our understanding of this fundamental
question by introducing a new complexity measure -- Bellman Eluder (BE)
dimension. We show that the family of RL problems of low BE dimension is
remarkably rich, which subsumes a vast majority of existing tractable RL
problems including but not limited to tabular MDPs, linear MDPs, reactive
POMDPs, low Bellman rank problems as well as low Eluder dimension problems.
This paper further designs a new optimization-based algorithm -- GOLF, and
reanalyzes a hypothesis elimination-based algorithm -- OLIVE (proposed in Jiang
et al., 2017). We prove that both algorithms learn the near-optimal policies of
low BE dimension problems in a number of samples that is polynomial in all
relevant parameters, but independent of the size of state-action space. Our
regret and sample complexity results match or improve the best existing results
for several well-known subclasses of low BE dimension problems.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph convolutional networks have significantly improved 3D human pose
estimation by representing the human skeleton as an undirected graph. However,
this representation fails to reflect the articulated characteristic of human
skeletons as the hierarchical orders among the joints are not explicitly
presented. In this paper, we propose to represent the human skeleton as a
directed graph with the joints as nodes and bones as edges that are directed
from parent joints to child joints. By so doing, the directions of edges can
explicitly reflect the hierarchical relationships among the nodes. Based on
this representation, we adopt the spatial-temporal directed graph convolution
(ST-DGConv) to extract features from 2D poses represented in a temporal
sequence of directed graphs. We further propose a spatial-temporal conditional
directed graph convolution (ST-CondDGConv) to leverage varying non-local
dependence for different poses by conditioning the graph topology on input
poses. Altogether, we form a U-shaped network with ST-DGConv and ST-CondDGConv
layers, named U-shaped Conditional Directed Graph Convolutional Network
(U-CondDGCN), for 3D human pose estimation from monocular videos. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our U-CondDGCN, we conducted extensive experiments on two
challenging large-scale benchmarks: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Both
quantitative and qualitative results show that our method achieves top
performance. Also, ablation studies show that directed graphs can better
exploit the hierarchy of articulated human skeletons than undirected graphs,
and the conditional connections can yield adaptive graph topologies for

material structure using compressive sensing based multiple-input and
multiple-output (MIMO) wireless radar. Here, the strong clutter due to the
reflection of the layered structure's surface often makes the detection of the
defects challenging. Thus, sophisticated signal separation methods are required
for improved defect detection. In many scenarios, the number of defects that we
are interested in is limited and the signaling response of the layered
structure can be modeled as a low-rank structure. Therefore, we propose joint
rank and sparsity minimization for defect detection. In particular, we propose
a non-convex approach based on the iteratively reweighted nuclear and
$\ell_1-$norm (a double-reweighted approach) to obtain a higher accuracy
compared to the conventional nuclear norm and $\ell_1-$norm minimization. To
this end, an iterative algorithm is designed to estimate the low-rank and
sparse contributions. Further, we propose deep learning to learn the parameters
of the algorithm (i.e., algorithm unfolding) to improve the accuracy and the
speed of convergence of the algorithm. Our numerical results show that the
proposed approach outperforms the conventional approaches in terms of mean
square errors of the recovered low-rank and sparse components and the speed of
convergence.]]></summary>

with our novel image sequence encoding network which relies on temporal
self-attention to extract rich and adaptive multi-scale spatio-temporal

for supervised learning. Traditionally, this question has been tackled using
the Information Bottleneck, which compresses the inputs while retaining
information about the targets, in a decoder-agnostic fashion. In machine
learning, however, our goal is not compression but rather generalization, which
is intimately linked to the predictive family or decoder of interest (e.g.
linear classifier). We propose the Decodable Information Bottleneck (DIB) that
considers information retention and compression from the perspective of the
desired predictive family. As a result, DIB gives rise to representations that
are optimal in terms of expected test performance and can be estimated with
guarantees. Empirically, we show that the framework can be used to enforce a
small generalization gap on downstream classifiers and to predict the
generalization ability of neural networks.]]></summary>

inter-cluster reliability of multidimensional projection (MDP), specifically
how well the inter-cluster structures are preserved between the original
high-dimensional space and the low-dimensional projection space. Measuring
inter-cluster reliability is crucial as it directly affects how well
inter-cluster tasks (e.g., identifying cluster relationships in the original
space from a projected view) can be conducted; however, despite the importance
of inter-cluster tasks, we found that previous metrics, such as Trustworthiness
and Continuity, fail to measure inter-cluster reliability. Our metrics consider
two aspects of the inter-cluster reliability: Steadiness measures the extent to
which clusters in the projected space form clusters in the original space, and
Cohesiveness measures the opposite. They extract random clusters with arbitrary
shapes and positions in one space and evaluate how much the clusters are
stretched or dispersed in the other space. Furthermore, our metrics can
quantify pointwise distortions, allowing for the visualization of inter-cluster
reliability in a projection, which we call a reliability map. Through
quantitative experiments, we verify that our metrics precisely capture the
distortions that harm inter-cluster reliability while previous metrics have
difficulty capturing the distortions. A case study also demonstrates that our
metrics and the reliability map 1) support users in selecting the proper
projection techniques or hyperparameters and 2) prevent misinterpretation while
performing inter-cluster tasks, thus allow an adequate identification of
inter-cluster structure.]]></summary>

forgets the previously learned tasks when being retrained on new tasks.
Overcoming the forgetting problem is a major problem in machine learning.
Numerous continual learning algorithms are very successful in incremental
learning of classification tasks, where new samples with their labels appear
frequently. However, there is currently no research that addresses the
catastrophic forgetting problem in regression tasks as far as we know. This
problem has emerged as one of the primary constraints in some applications,
such as renewable energy forecasts. This article clarifies problem-related
definitions and proposes a new methodological framework that can forecast
targets and update itself by means of continual learning. The framework
consists of forecasting neural networks and buffers, which store newly
collected data from a non-stationary data stream in an application. The changed
probability distribution of the data stream, which the framework has
identified, will be learned sequentially. The framework is called CLeaR
(Continual Learning for Regression Tasks), where components can be flexibly
customized for a specific application scenario. We design two sets of
experiments to evaluate the CLeaR framework concerning fitting error
(training), prediction error (test), and forgetting ratio. The first one is
based on an artificial time series to explore how hyperparameters affect the
CLeaR framework. The second one is designed with data collected from European
wind farms to evaluate the CLeaR framework's performance in a real-world
application. The experimental results demonstrate that the CLeaR framework can
continually acquire knowledge in the data stream and improve the prediction
accuracy. The article concludes with further research issues arising from
requirements to extend the framework.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quantization based model compression serves as high performing and fast
approach for inference that yields models which are highly compressed when
compared to their full-precision floating point counterparts. The most extreme
quantization is a 1-bit representation of parameters such that they have only
two possible values, typically -1(0) or +1, enabling efficient implementation
of the ubiquitous dot product using only additions. The main contribution of
this work is the introduction of a method to smooth the combinatorial problem
of determining a binary vector of weights to minimize the expected loss for a
given objective by means of empirical risk minimization with backpropagation.
This is achieved by approximating a multivariate binary state over the weights
utilizing a deterministic and differentiable transformation of real-valued,
continuous parameters. The proposed method adds little overhead in training,
can be readily applied without any substantial modifications to the original
architecture, does not introduce additional saturating nonlinearities or
auxiliary losses, and does not prohibit applying other methods for binarizing
the activations. Contrary to common assertions made in the literature, it is
demonstrated that binary weighted networks can train well with the same
standard optimization techniques and similar hyperparameter settings as their
full-precision counterparts, specifically momentum SGD with large learning
rates and $L_2$ regularization. To conclude experiments demonstrate the method
performs remarkably well across a number of inductive image classification
tasks with various architectures compared to their full-precision counterparts.

need to be made explainable in order to enhance real-world adoption. Our past
studies and ongoing interactions indicate that medical experts can use AI
systems with greater trust if there are ways to connect the model inferences
about patients to explanations that are tied back to the context of use.
Specifically, risk prediction is a complex problem of diagnostic and
interventional importance to clinicians wherein they consult different sources
to make decisions. To enable the adoption of the ever improving AI risk
prediction models in practice, we have begun to explore techniques to
contextualize such models along three dimensions of interest: the patients'
clinical state, AI predictions about their risk of complications, and
algorithmic explanations supporting the predictions. We validate the importance
of these dimensions by implementing a proof-of-concept (POC) in type-2 diabetes
(T2DM) use case where we assess the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) - a
common T2DM comorbidity. Within the POC, we include risk prediction models for
CKD, post-hoc explainers of the predictions, and other natural-language modules
which operationalize domain knowledge and CPGs to provide context. With primary
care physicians (PCP) as our end-users, we present our initial results and
clinician feedback in this paper. Our POC approach covers multiple knowledge

reduction and other tasks involving high-dimensional data sets with low

a vertex with each data point and a weighted edge with each pair. Existing
theory shows that the Laplacian matrix of the graph converges to the
Laplace-Beltrami operator of the data manifold, under the assumption that the
pairwise affinities are based on the Euclidean norm. In this paper, we
determine the limiting differential operator for graph Laplacians constructed
using $\textit{any}$ norm. Our proof involves an interplay between the second
fundamental form of the manifold and the convex geometry of the given norm's
unit ball. To demonstrate the potential benefits of non-Euclidean norms in
manifold learning, we consider the task of mapping the motion of large
molecules with continuous variability. In a numerical simulation we show that a
modified Laplacian eigenmaps algorithm, based on the Earthmover's distance,
outperforms the classic Euclidean Laplacian eigenmaps, both in terms of
computational cost and the sample size needed to recover the intrinsic

steps in theorem proving. We explore this in the connection tableau calculus

start by incorporating a state-of-the-art learning algorithm -- a graph neural
network (GNN) -- into the plCoP theorem prover. Then we use it to observe the
system's behaviour in a reinforcement learning setting, i.e., when learning
inference guidance from successful Monte-Carlo tree searches on many problems.
Despite its better pattern matching capability, the GNN initially performs
worse than a simpler previously used learning algorithm. We observe that the
simpler algorithm is less confident, i.e., its recommendations have higher
entropy. This leads us to explore how the entropy of the inference selection
implemented via the neural network influences the proof search. This is related
to research in human decision-making under uncertainty, and in particular the
probability matching theory. Our main result shows that a proper entropy
regularisation, i.e., training the GNN not to be overconfident, greatly

to traditional, hand-crafted frameworks for robotic manipulation. Surprisingly,
an extension of these methods to the multiview domain is relatively unexplored.
A successful multiview policy could be deployed on a mobile manipulation
platform, allowing the robot to complete a task regardless of its view of the
scene. In this work, we demonstrate that a multiview policy can be found
through imitation learning by collecting data from a variety of viewpoints. We
illustrate the general applicability of the method by learning to complete
several challenging multi-stage and contact-rich tasks, from numerous
viewpoints, both in a simulated environment and on a real mobile manipulation
platform. Furthermore, we analyze our policies to determine the benefits of
learning from multiview data compared to learning with data collected from a
fixed perspective. We show that learning from multiview data results in little,
if any, penalty to performance for a fixed-view task compared to learning with
an equivalent amount of fixed-view data. Finally, we examine the visual
features learned by the multiview and fixed-view policies. Our results indicate
that multiview policies implicitly learn to identify spatially correlated
features.]]></summary>

in stock prediction. While long-range dependencies and chaotic property are
still two major issues that lower the performance of state-of-the-art deep

novel framework to address both issues. Specifically, in terms of transforming

Then, structural information, referring to associations among temporal points
and the node weights, is extracted from the mapped graphs to resolve the
problems regarding long-range dependencies and the chaotic property. We take
graph embeddings to represent the associations among temporal points as the
prediction model inputs. Node weights are used as a priori knowledge to enhance
the learning of temporal attention. The effectiveness of our proposed framework
is validated using real-world stock data, and our approach obtains the best
performance among several state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, in the

control that allows heterogeneous multirotors in a swarm to safely fly in close
proximity. Such operation for drones is challenging due to complex aerodynamic
interaction forces, such as downwash generated by nearby drones and ground
effect. Conventional planning and control methods neglect capturing these
interaction forces, resulting in sparse swarm configuration during flight. Our
approach combines a physics-based nominal dynamics model with learned Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs) with strong Lipschitz properties. We make use of two
techniques to accurately predict the aerodynamic interactions between
heterogeneous multirotors: i) spectral normalization for stability and
generalization guarantees of unseen data and ii) heterogeneous deep sets for
supporting any number of heterogeneous neighbors in a permutation-invariant
manner without reducing expressiveness. The learned residual dynamics benefit
both the proposed interaction-aware multi-robot motion planning and the
nonlinear tracking control design because the learned interaction forces reduce
the modelling errors. Experimental results demonstrate that Neural-Swarm2 is
able to generalize to larger swarms beyond training cases and significantly
outperforms a baseline nonlinear tracking controller with up to three times
reduction in worst-case tracking errors.]]></summary>

accuracy of candidate architectures has drawn increasing attention due to its
simplicity and effectiveness. Previous works usually employ neural
network-based predictors which require more delicate design and are easy to
overfit. Considering that most architectures are represented as sequences of
discrete symbols which are more like tabular data and preferred by non-neural
predictors, in this paper, we study an alternative approach which uses
non-neural model for accuracy prediction. Specifically, as decision tree based
models can better handle tabular data, we leverage gradient boosting decision
tree (GBDT) as the predictor for NAS. We demonstrate that the GBDT predictor
can achieve comparable (if not better) prediction accuracy than neural network
based predictors. Moreover, considering that a compact search space can ease
the search process, we propose to prune the search space gradually according to
important features derived from GBDT. In this way, NAS can be performed by
first pruning the search space and then searching a neural architecture, which
is more efficient and effective. Experiments on NASBench-101 and ImageNet
demonstrate the effectiveness of using GBDT as predictor for NAS: (1) On
NASBench-101, it is 22x, 8x, and 6x more sample efficient than random search,
regularized evolution, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in finding the global
optimum; (2) It achieves 24.2% top-1 error rate on ImageNet, and further
achieves 23.4% top-1 error rate on ImageNet when enhanced with search space
pruning. Code is provided in the supplementary materials.]]></summary>

multidimensional time-series datasets. Missing values are commonplace in
decision support platforms that aggregate data over long time stretches from
disparate sources, and reliable data analytics calls for careful handling of
missing data. One strategy is imputing the missing values, and a wide variety
of algorithms exist spanning simple interpolation, matrix factorization methods
like SVD, statistical models like Kalman filters, and recent deep learning
methods. We show that often these provide worse results on aggregate analytics
compared to just excluding the missing data. DeepMVI uses a neural network to
combine fine-grained and coarse-grained patterns along a time series, and
trends from related series across categorical dimensions. After failing with
off-the-shelf neural architectures, we design our own network that includes a
temporal transformer with a novel convolutional window feature, and kernel
regression with learned embeddings. The parameters and their training are
designed carefully to generalize across different placements of missing blocks
and data characteristics. Experiments across nine real datasets, four different
missing scenarios, comparing seven existing methods show that DeepMVI is
significantly more accurate, reducing error by more than 50% in more than half

matrix factorization methods, we justify the increased time overheads by
showing that DeepMVI is the only option that provided overall more accurate

school admission, or loan approval. Typically, these systems rely on labeled
data for training a classification model. However, in many scenarios,
ground-truth labels are unavailable, and instead we have only access to
imperfect labels as the result of (potentially biased) human-made decisions.
Despite being imperfect, historical decisions often contain some useful
information on the unobserved true labels. In this paper, we focus on scenarios
where only imperfect labels are available and propose a new fair ranking-based
decision system based on monotonic relationships between legitimate features
and the outcome. Our approach is both intuitive and easy to implement, and thus
particularly suitable for adoption in real-world settings. More in detail, we
introduce a distance-based decision criterion, which incorporates useful
information from historical decisions and accounts for unwanted correlation
between protected and legitimate features. Through extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world data, we show that our method is fair in the sense
that a) it assigns the desirable outcome to the most qualified individuals, and
b) it removes the effect of stereotypes in decision-making, thereby
outperforming traditional classification algorithms. Additionally, we are able
to show theoretically that our method is consistent with a prominent concept of
individual fairness which states that "similar individuals should be treated
similarly."]]></summary>

digital display advertising. Commercial systems often require to update models
in an online learning manner to catch up with the evolving data distribution.
However, conversions usually do not happen immediately after a user click. This
may result in inaccurate labeling, which is called delayed feedback problem. In
previous studies, delayed feedback problem is handled either by waiting
positive label for a long period of time, or by consuming the negative sample
on its arrival and then insert a positive duplicate when a conversion happens
later. Indeed, there is a trade-off between waiting for more accurate labels
and utilizing fresh data, which is not considered in existing works. To strike
a balance in this trade-off, we propose Elapsed-Time Sampling Delayed Feedback
Model (ES-DFM), which models the relationship between the observed conversion
distribution and the true conversion distribution. Then we optimize the
expectation of true conversion distribution via importance sampling under the
elapsed-time sampling distribution. We further estimate the importance weight
for each instance, which is used as the weight of loss function in CVR
prediction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ES-DFM, we conduct extensive
experiments on a public data and a private industrial dataset. Experimental
results confirm that our method consistently outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A better understanding of dispersion in natural streams requires knowledge of
longitudinal dispersion coefficient(LDC). Various methods have been proposed
for predictions of LDC. Those studies can be grouped into three types:
analytical, statistical and ML-driven researches(Implicit and explicit).
However, a comprehensive evaluation of them is still lacking. In this paper, we
first present an in-depth analysis of those methods and find out their defects.
This is carried out on an extensive database composed of 660 samples of
hydraulic and channel properties worldwide. The reliability and
representativeness of utilized data are enhanced through the deployment of the
Subset Selection of Maximum Dissimilarity(SSMD) for testing set selection and
the Inter Quartile Range(IQR) for removal of the outlier. The evaluation
reveals the rank of those methods as: ML-driven method > the statistical method
> the analytical method. Whereas implicit ML-driven methods are black-boxes in
nature, explicit ML-driven methods have more potential in prediction of LDC.
Besides, overfitting is a universal problem in existing models. Those models
also suffer from a fixed parameter combination. To establish an interpretable
model for LDC prediction with higher performance, we then design a novel
symbolic regression method called evolutionary symbolic regression
network(ESRN). It is a combination of genetic algorithms and neural networks.
Strategies are introduced to avoid overfitting and explore more parameter
combinations. Results show that the ESRN model has superiorities over other
existing symbolic models in performance. The proposed model is suitable for
practical engineering problems due to its advantage in low requirement of
parameters (only w and U* are required). It can provide convincing solutions
for situations where the field test cannot be carried out or limited field
information can be obtained.]]></summary>

and pose from noisy point cloud. Traditional approaches search for
correspondences and conduct model fitting iteratively where a good
initialization is critical. Relying on large amount of dataset with
ground-truth annotations, recent learning-based approaches predict
correspondences for every vertice on the point cloud; Chamfer distance is
usually used to minimize the distance between a deformed template model and the
input point cloud. However, Chamfer distance is quite sensitive to noise and
outliers, thus could be unreliable to assign correspondences. To address these
issues, we model the probability distribution of the input point cloud as
generated from a parametric human model under a Gaussian Mixture Model. Instead
of explicitly aligning correspondences, we treat the process of correspondence
search as an implicit probabilistic association by updating the posterior
probability of the template model given the input. A novel unsupervised loss is
further derived that penalizes the discrepancy between the deformed template
and the input point cloud conditioned on the posterior probability. Our
approach is very flexible, which works with both complete point cloud and
incomplete ones including even a single depth image as input. Our network is
trained from scratch with no need to warm-up the network with supervised data.
Compared to previous unsupervised methods, our method shows the capability to
deal with substantial noise and outliers. Extensive experiments conducted on
various public synthetic datasets as well as a very noisy real dataset (i.e.
CMU Panoptic) demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over the
state-of-the-art methods. Code can be found

improvements on various vision-language tasks. Most existing methods employ a
transformer-based multimodal encoder to jointly model visual tokens
(region-based image features) and word tokens. Because the visual tokens and
word tokens are unaligned, it is challenging for the multimodal encoder to
learn image-text interactions. In this paper, we introduce a contrastive loss
to ALign the image and text representations BEfore Fusing (ALBEF) them through
cross-modal attention, which enables more grounded vision and language
representation learning. Unlike most existing methods, our method does not
require bounding box annotations nor high-resolution images. In order to
improve learning from noisy web data, we propose momentum distillation, a
self-training method which learns from pseudo-targets produced by a momentum
model. We provide a theoretical analysis of ALBEF from a mutual information
maximization perspective, showing that different training tasks can be
interpreted as different ways to generate views for an image-text pair. ALBEF
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream vision-language
tasks. On image-text retrieval, ALBEF outperforms methods that are pre-trained
on orders of magnitude larger datasets. On VQA and NLVR$^2$, ALBEF achieves
absolute improvements of 2.37% and 3.84% compared to the state-of-the-art,
while enjoying faster inference speed. Code and pre-trained models are

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV) is a non-invasive experimental technique
widely used in medicine and engineering to measure the velocity field of a
fluid. These measurements are dense but have a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
The measurements can be de-noised by imposing physical constraints on the flow,
which are encapsulated in governing equations for mass and momentum. Previous
studies have required the shape of the boundary (for example, a blood vessel)
to be known a priori. This, however, requires a set of additional measurements,
which can be expensive to obtain. In this paper, we present a physics-informed
neural network that instead uses the noisy MRV data alone to simultaneously
infer the most likely boundary shape and de-noised velocity field. We achieve
this by training an auxiliary neural network that takes the value 1.0 within
the inferred domain of the governing PDE and 0.0 outside. This network is used
to weight the PDE residual term in the loss function accordingly and implicitly
learns the geometry of the system. We test our algorithm by assimilating both
synthetic and real MRV measurements for flows that can be well modeled by the
Poisson and Stokes equations. We find that we are able to reconstruct very
noisy (SNR = 2.5) MRV signals and recover the ground truth with low
reconstruction errors of 3.7 - 7.5%. The simplicity and flexibility of our
physics-informed neural network approach can readily scale to assimilating MRV
data with complex 3D geometries, time-varying 4D data, or unknown parameters in
the physical model.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to spurious correlations, machine learning systems often fail to
generalize to environments whose distributions differ from the ones used at
training time. Prior work addressing this, either explicitly or implicitly,
attempted to find a data representation that has an invariant relationship with
the target. This is done by leveraging a diverse set of training environments
to reduce the effect of spurious features and build an invariant predictor.
However, these methods have generalization guarantees only when both data
representation and classifiers come from a linear model class. We propose
invariant Causal Representation Learning (iCaRL), an approach that enables
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in the nonlinear setting (i.e.,
nonlinear representations and nonlinear classifiers). It builds upon a
practical and general assumption: the prior over the data representation (i.e.,
a set of latent variables encoding the data) given the target and the
environment belongs to general exponential family distributions. Based on this,
we show that it is possible to identify the data representation up to simple
transformations. We also prove that all direct causes of the target can be
fully discovered, which further enables us to obtain generalization guarantees
in the nonlinear setting. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms a variety of baseline
methods. Finally, in the discussion, we further explore the aforementioned
assumption and propose a more general hypothesis, called the Agnostic
Hypothesis: there exist a set of hidden causal factors affecting both inputs
and outcomes. The Agnostic Hypothesis can provide a unifying view of machine
learning. More importantly, it can inspire a new direction to explore a general
theory for identifying hidden causal factors, which is key to enabling the OOD
generalization guarantees.]]></summary>

histograms is a fundamental task in machine learning. One of the popular
solution methods for this task is to compute the barycenter of the probability
measures under the Wasserstein metric. However, approximating the Wasserstein
barycenter is numerically challenging because of the curse of dimensionality.
This paper proposes the projection robust Wasserstein barycenter (PRWB) that
has the potential to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. Since PRWB is
numerically very challenging to solve, we further propose a relaxed PRWB
(RPRWB) model, which is more tractable. The RPRWB projects the probability
measures onto a lower-dimensional subspace that maximizes the Wasserstein
barycenter objective. The resulting problem is a max-min problem over the
Stiefel manifold. By combining the iterative Bregman projection algorithm and
Riemannian optimization, we propose two new algorithms for computing the RPRWB.
The complexity of arithmetic operations of the proposed algorithms for
obtaining an $\epsilon$-stationary solution is analyzed. We incorporate the
RPRWB into a discrete distribution clustering algorithm, and the numerical
results on real text datasets confirm that our RPRWB model helps improve the
clustering performance significantly.]]></summary>

learning and deep learning. Despite its popularity, the Wasserstein distance is
hard to approximate because of the curse of dimensionality. A recently proposed
approach to alleviate the curse of dimensionality is to project the sampled
data from the high dimensional probability distribution onto a
lower-dimensional subspace, and then compute the Wasserstein distance between
the projected data. However, this approach requires to solve a max-min problem
over the Stiefel manifold, which is very challenging in practice. The only
existing work that solves this problem directly is the RGAS (Riemannian
Gradient Ascent with Sinkhorn Iteration) algorithm, which requires to solve an
entropy-regularized optimal transport problem in each iteration, and thus can
be costly for large-scale problems. In this paper, we propose a Riemannian
block coordinate descent (RBCD) method to solve this problem, which is based on
a novel reformulation of the regularized max-min problem over the Stiefel
manifold. We show that the complexity of arithmetic operations for RBCD to
obtain an $\epsilon$-stationary point is $O(\epsilon^{-3})$. This significantly
improves the corresponding complexity of RGAS, which is $O(\epsilon^{-12})$.
Moreover, our RBCD has very low per-iteration complexity, and hence is suitable
for large-scale problems. Numerical results on both synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that our method is more efficient than existing methods, especially
when the number of sampled data is very large.]]></summary>

large datasets and performing various learning tasks, by leveraging crowds of
human annotators. When additional information is available about the data,
semi-supervised crowdsourcing approaches that enhance the aggregation of labels
from human annotators are well motivated. This work deals with semi-supervised
crowdsourced classification, under two regimes of semi-supervision: a) label
constraints, that provide ground-truth labels for a subset of data; and b)
potentially easier to obtain instance-level constraints, that indicate
relationships between pairs of data. Bayesian algorithms based on variational
inference are developed for each regime, and their quantifiably improved
performance, compared to unsupervised crowdsourcing, is analytically and
empirically validated on several crowdsourcing datasets.]]></summary>

distribution -- can substantially degrade the accuracy of machine learning (ML)
systems deployed in the wild. Despite their ubiquity in the real-world
deployments, these distribution shifts are under-represented in the datasets
widely used in the ML community today. To address this gap, we present WILDS, a
curated benchmark of 10 datasets reflecting a diverse range of distribution
shifts that naturally arise in real-world applications, such as shifts across
hospitals for tumor identification; across camera traps for wildlife
monitoring; and across time and location in satellite imaging and poverty
mapping. On each dataset, we show that standard training yields substantially
lower out-of-distribution than in-distribution performance. This gap remains
even with models trained by existing methods for tackling distribution shifts,
underscoring the need for new methods for training models that are more robust
to the types of distribution shifts that arise in practice. To facilitate
method development, we provide an open-source package that automates dataset
loading, contains default model architectures and hyperparameters, and
standardizes evaluations. Code and leaderboards are available at

the efficacy of pseudo-labeling for semi-supervised models trained both with
Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and Sequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq)
losses. Iterative Pseudo-Labeling (IPL), which continuously trains a single
model using pseudo-labels iteratively re-generated as the model learns, has
been shown to further improve performance in ASR. We improve upon the IPL
algorithm: as the model learns, we propose to iteratively re-generate
transcriptions with hard labels (the most probable tokens), that is, without a
language model. We call this approach Language-Model-Free IPL (slimIPL) and
give a resultant training setup for low-resource settings with CTC-based
models. slimIPL features a dynamic cache for pseudo-labels which reduces
sensitivity to changes in relabeling hyperparameters and results in improves
training stability. slimIPL is also highly-efficient and requires 3.5-4x fewer
computational resources to converge than other state-of-the-art
semi/self-supervised approaches. With only 10 hours of labeled audio, slimIPL
is competitive with self-supervised approaches, and is state-of-the-art with
100 hours of labeled audio without the use of a language model both at test
time and during pseudo-label generation.]]></summary>

important factor for modeling users in the design of recommendation systems.
Recent studies are starting to focus on predicting user intention (what users
want) beyond user preference (what users like). In this work, a user intention
model is proposed based on deep sequential topic analysis. The model predicts a
user's intention in terms of the topic of interest. The Hybrid Topic Model
(HTM) comprising Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Word2Vec is proposed to
derive the topic of interest of users and the history of preferences. HTM finds
the true topics of papers estimating word-topic distribution which includes
syntactic and semantic correlations among words. Next, to model user intention,
a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based sequential deep learning model is
proposed. This model takes into account temporal context, namely the time
difference between clicks of two consecutive papers seen by a user. Extensive
experiments with the real-world research paper dataset indicate that the
proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
Further, the proposed approach introduces a new road map to model a user
activity suitable for the design of a research paper recommendation system.]]></summary>

ability to generalize across sizes, specifically from small to large graphs, is
still not well understood. In this paper, we identify an important type of data
where generalization from small to large graphs is challenging: graph
distributions for which the local structure depends on the graph size. This
effect occurs in multiple important graph learning domains, including social
and biological networks. We first prove that when there is a difference between
the local structures, GNNs are not guaranteed to generalize across sizes: there
are "bad" global minima that do well on small graphs but fail on large graphs.
We then study the size-generalization problem empirically and demonstrate that
when there is a discrepancy in local structure, GNNs tend to converge to
non-generalizing solutions. Finally, we suggest two approaches for improving
size generalization, motivated by our findings. Notably, we propose a novel
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) task aimed at learning meaningful
representations of local structures that appear in large graphs. Our SSL task
improves classification accuracy on several popular datasets.]]></summary>

priors significantly outperform vanilla neural networks in learning and
predicting the long term dynamics of complex physical systems from noisy data.
Despite this success, there has only been a limited study on how to optimally
combine physics priors to improve predictive performance. To tackle this
problem we unpack and generalize recent innovations into individual inductive
bias segments. As such, we are able to systematically investigate all possible
combinations of inductive biases of which existing methods are a natural
subset. Using this framework we introduce Variational Integrator Graph Networks
- a novel method that unifies the strengths of existing approaches by combining
an energy constraint, high-order symplectic variational integrators, and graph
neural networks. We demonstrate, across an extensive ablation, that the
proposed unifying framework outperforms existing methods, for data-efficient
learning and in predictive accuracy, across both single and many-body problems
studied in recent literature. We empirically show that the improvements arise
because high order variational integrators combined with a potential energy
constraint induce coupled learning of generalized position and momentum updates
which can be formalized via the Partitioned Runge-Kutta method.]]></summary>

only seek to verify that already-trained networks obey constraints, requiring
alternating training and verification. Instead, this work proposes a
constrained method to simultaneously train and verify a feedforward neural
network with rectified linear unit (ReLU) nonlinearities. Constraints are
enforced by computing the network's output-space reachable set and ensuring
that it does not intersect with unsafe sets; training is achieved by
formulating a novel collision-check loss function between the reachable set and
unsafe portions of the output space. The reachable and unsafe sets are
represented by constrained zonotopes, a convex polytope representation that
enables differentiable collision checking. The proposed method is demonstrated
successfully on a network with one nonlinearity layer and approximately 50

applications, which plays a vital role in real-world scenarios such as
autonomous driving systems and drones. In this study, we devise a novel
lightweight network using a multi-scale context fusion (MSCFNet) scheme, which
explores an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture to dispose this problem.
More specifically, the encoder adopts some developed efficient asymmetric
residual (EAR) modules, which are composed of factorization depth-wise
convolution and dilation convolution. Meanwhile, instead of complicated
computation, simple deconvolution is applied in the decoder to further reduce
the amount of parameters while still maintaining high segmentation accuracy.
Also, MSCFNet has branches with efficient attention modules from different
stages of the network to well capture multi-scale contextual information. Then
we combine them before the final classification to enhance the expression of
the features and improve the segmentation efficiency. Comprehensive experiments
on challenging datasets have demonstrated that the proposed MSCFNet, which

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite broad application during labor and delivery, there remains
considerable debate about the value of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM). EFM
includes the surveillance of the fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns in conjunction
with the maternal uterine contractions providing a wealth of data about fetal
behavior and the threat of diminished oxygenation and perfusion. Adverse
outcomes universally associate a fetal injury with the failure to timely
respond to FHR pattern information. Historically, the EFM data, stored
digitally, are available only as rasterized pdf images for contemporary or
historical discussion and examination. In reality, however, they are rarely
reviewed systematically. Using a unique archive of EFM collected over 50 years
of practice in conjunction with adverse outcomes, we present a deep learning
framework for training and detection of incipient or past fetal injury. We
report 94% accuracy in identifying early, preventable fetal injury intrapartum.
This framework is suited for automating an early warning and decision support
system for maintaining fetal well-being during the stresses of labor.
Ultimately, such a system could enable a physician to timely respond during
labor and prevent adverse outcomes. When adverse outcomes cannot be avoided,
they can provide guidance to the early neuroprotective treatment of the
newborn.]]></summary>

define a lossy abstraction of the transition model of a domain. We then propose
a bottom-up relational learning method for operator learning and show how the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keyword spotting (KWS) is an important technique for speech applications,
which enables users to activate devices by speaking a keyword phrase. Although
a phoneme classifier can be used for KWS, exploiting a large amount of
transcribed data for automatic speech recognition (ASR), there is a mismatch
between the training criterion (phoneme recognition) and the target task (KWS).
Recently, multi-task learning has been applied to KWS to exploit both ASR and
KWS training data. In this approach, an output of an acoustic model is split
into two branches for the two tasks, one for phoneme transcription trained with
the ASR data and one for keyword classification trained with the KWS data. In
this paper, we introduce a cross attention decoder in the multi-task learning
framework. Unlike the conventional multi-task learning approach with the simple
split of the output layer, the cross attention decoder summarizes information
from a phonetic encoder by performing cross attention between the encoder
outputs and a trainable query sequence to predict a confidence score for the
KWS task. Experimental results on KWS tasks show that the proposed approach
outperformed the conventional multi-task learning with split branches and a
bi-directional long short-team memory decoder by 12% on average.]]></summary>

fundamental query, which can be potentially examined using information theory

and compression. It is debatable if the compression phase is necessary to
generalize the input-output relations extracted from training data. In this

vanilla autoencoders demonstrated the compression phase, which was amplified
after imposing sparsity regularization for hidden activities. However, we found
that the compression phase is not universally observed in different species of
autoencoders, including variational autoencoders, that have special constraints
on network weights or manifold of hidden space. These types of autoencoders
exhibited perfect generalization ability for test data without requiring the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semantic segmentation for scene understanding is nowadays widely demanded,
raising significant challenges for the algorithm efficiency, especially its
applications on resource-limited platforms. Current segmentation models are
trained and evaluated on massive high-resolution scene images ("data level")
and suffer from the expensive computation arising from the required multi-scale
aggregation("network level"). In both folds, the computational and energy costs
in training and inference are notable due to the often desired large input
resolutions and heavy computational burden of segmentation models. To this end,
we propose DANCE, general automated DAta-Network Co-optimization for Efficient
segmentation model training and inference. Distinct from existing efficient
segmentation approaches that focus merely on light-weight network design, DANCE
distinguishes itself as an automated simultaneous data-network co-optimization
via both input data manipulation and network architecture slimming.
Specifically, DANCE integrates automated data slimming which adaptively
downsamples/drops input images and controls their corresponding contribution to
the training loss guided by the images' spatial complexity. Such a downsampling
operation, in addition to slimming down the cost associated with the input size
directly, also shrinks the dynamic range of input object and context scales,
therefore motivating us to also adaptively slim the network to match the
downsampled data. Extensive experiments and ablating studies (on four SOTA
segmentation models with three popular segmentation datasets under two training
settings) demonstrate that DANCE can achieve "all-win" towards efficient
segmentation(reduced training cost, less expensive inference, and better mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU)).]]></summary>

very likely that AAC methods learn only the information contained in the
utilized datasets. In this paper we present a first approach for continuously
adapting an AAC method to new information, using a continual learning method.
In our scenario, a pre-optimized AAC method is used for some unseen general
audio signals and can update its parameters in order to adapt to the new
information, given a new reference caption. We evaluate our method using a
freely available, pre-optimized AAC method and two freely available AAC
datasets. We compare our proposed method with three scenarios, two of training

Logic rules provide interpretable explanations when used for prediction as well
as being able to generalize to other tasks, and hence are critical to learn.
Existing methods either suffer from the problem of searching in a large search
space (e.g., neural logic programming) or ineffective optimization due to
sparse rewards (e.g., techniques based on reinforcement learning). To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a probabilistic model called RNNLogic.
RNNLogic treats logic rules as a latent variable, and simultaneously trains a
rule generator as well as a reasoning predictor with logic rules. We develop an
EM-based algorithm for optimization. In each iteration, the reasoning predictor
is first updated to explore some generated logic rules for reasoning. Then in
the E-step, we select a set of high-quality rules from all generated rules with
both the rule generator and reasoning predictor via posterior inference; and in
the M-step, the rule generator is updated with the rules selected in the
E-step. Experiments on four datasets prove the effectiveness of RNNLogic.]]></summary>

kernel Hilbert space (hyper-RKHS), illustrates its utility for kernel learning
and out-of-sample extensions, and proves asymptotic convergence results for the
introduced regression models in an approximation theory view. Algorithmically,
we consider two regularized regression models with bivariate forms in this
space, including kernel ridge regression (KRR) and support vector regression
(SVR) endowed with hyper-RKHS, and further combine divide-and-conquer with
Nystr\"{o}m approximation for scalability in large sample cases. This framework
is general: the underlying kernel is learned from a broad class, and can be
positive definite or not, which adapts to various requirements in kernel
learning. Theoretically, we study the convergence behavior of regularized
regression algorithms in hyper-RKHS and derive the learning rates, which goes
beyond the classical analysis on RKHS due to the non-trivial independence of
pairwise samples and the characterisation of hyper-RKHS. Experimentally,
results on several benchmarks suggest that the employed framework is able to
learn a general kernel function form an arbitrary similarity matrix, and thus
achieves a satisfactory performance on classification tasks.]]></summary>

the driving scenarios. Autonomous vehicles (AV) are similarly becoming involved
in the process. Nowadays, the development of AV in urban places underpins
essential safety concerns for vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians.
Therefore, to make the roads safer, it is critical to classify and predict
their future behavior. In this paper, we present a framework based on multiple
variations of the Transformer models to reason attentively about the dynamic
evolution of the pedestrians' past trajectory and predict its future actions of
crossing or not crossing the street. We proved that using only bounding boxes
as input to our model can outperform the previous state-of-the-art models and
reach a prediction accuracy of 91 % and an F1-score of 0.83 on the PIE dataset
up to two seconds ahead in the future. In addition, we introduced a large-size
simulated dataset (CP2A) using CARLA for action prediction. Our model has
similarly reached high accuracy (91 %) and F1-score (0.91) on this dataset.
Interestingly, we showed that pre-training our Transformer model on the
simulated dataset and then fine-tuning it on the real dataset can be very
effective for the action prediction task.]]></summary>

several concepts that were so far studied independently - graph kernels,
attention-based networks with structural priors and more recently, efficient
Transformers architectures applying small memory footprint implicit attention
methods via low rank decomposition techniques. The goal of the paper is
twofold. Proposed by us Graph Kernel Attention Transformers (or GKATs) are much
more expressive than SOTA GNNs as capable of modeling longer-range dependencies
within a single layer. Consequently, they can use more shallow architecture
design. Furthermore, GKAT attention layers scale linearly rather than
quadratically in the number of nodes of the input graphs, even when those
graphs are dense, requiring less compute than their regular graph attention
counterparts. They achieve it by applying new classes of graph kernels
admitting random feature map decomposition via random walks on graphs. As a
byproduct of the introduced techniques, we obtain a new class of learnable
graph sketches, called graphots, compactly encoding topological graph
properties as well as nodes' features. We conducted exhaustive empirical
comparison of our method with nine different GNN classes on tasks ranging from
motif detection through social network classification to bioinformatics
challenges, showing consistent gains coming from GKATs.]]></summary>

important role in sharing digital information. Despite the popularity and
usefulness of social media, there have been many instances where corrupted
users found ways to abuse it, as for instance, through raising or lowering
user's credibility. As a result, while social media facilitates an
unprecedented ease of access to information, it also introduces a new challenge
- that of ascertaining the credibility of shared information. Currently, there
is no automated way of determining which news or users are credible and which
are not. Hence, establishing a system that can measure the social media user's
credibility has become an issue of great importance. Assigning a credibility
score to a user has piqued the interest of not only the research community but
also most of the big players on both sides - such as Facebook, on the side of
industry, and political parties on the societal one. In this work, we created a
model which, we hope, will ultimately facilitate and support the increase of
trust in the social network communities. Our model collected data and analysed
the behaviour of~50,000 politicians on Twitter. Influence score, based on
several chosen features, was assigned to each evaluated user. Further, we
classified the political Twitter users as either trusted or untrusted using
random forest, multilayer perceptron, and support vector machine. An active
learning model was used to classify any unlabelled ambiguous records from our
dataset. Finally, to measure the performance of the proposed model, we used
precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy as the main evaluation metrics.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exploiting sparsity is a key technique in accelerating quantized
convolutional neural network (CNN) inference on mobile devices. Prior sparse
CNN accelerators largely exploit un-structured sparsity and achieve significant
speedups. Due to the unbounded, largely unpredictable sparsity patterns,
however, exploiting unstructured sparsity requires complicated hardware design
with significant energy and area overhead, which is particularly detrimental to
mobile/IoT inference scenarios where energy and area efficiency are crucial. We
propose to exploit structured sparsity, more specifically, Density Bound Block
(DBB) sparsity for both weights and activations. DBB block tensors bound the
maximum number of non-zeros per block. DBB thus exposes statically predictable
sparsity patterns that enable lean sparsity-exploiting hardware. We propose new
hardware primitives to implement DBB sparsity for (static) weights and
(dynamic) activations, respectively, with very low overheads. Building on top
of the primitives, we describe S2TA, a systolic array-based CNN accelerator
that exploits joint weight and activation DBB sparsity and new dimensions of
data reuse unavailable on the traditional systolic array. S2TA in 16nm achieves
more than 2x speedup and energy reduction compared to a strong baseline of a
systolic array with zero-value clock gating, over five popular CNN benchmarks.
Compared to two recent non-systolic sparse accelerators, Eyeriss v2 (65nm) and
SparTen (45nm), S2TA in 65nm uses about 2.2x and 3.1x less energy per
inference, respectively.]]></summary>

components strongly correlate with well known, but nontrivial, parameters that
characterize emergent behaviors in the Anderson impurity model. In particular,
one latent space component correlates with particle-hole asymmetry, while
another is in near one-to-one correspondence with the Kondo temperature, a
dynamically generated low-energy scale in the impurity model. With symbolic
regression, we model this component as a function of bare physical input
parameters and "rediscover" the non-perturbative formula for the Kondo
temperature. The machine learning pipeline we develop opens opportunities to
discover new domain knowledge in other physical systems.]]></summary>

between human vocal characteristics and facial features. However, existing
approaches generate faces simply from voice, without exploring the set of
features that contribute to these observed correlations. A computational
methodology to explore this can be devised by rephrasing the question to: "how
much would a target face have to change in order to be perceived as the
originator of a source voice?" With this in perspective, we propose a framework
to morph a target face in response to a given voice in a way that facial
features are implicitly guided by learned voice-face correlation in this paper.
Our framework includes a guided autoencoder that converts one face to another,
controlled by a unique model-conditioning component called a gating controller
which modifies the reconstructed face based on input voice recordings. We
evaluate the framework on VoxCelab and VGGFace datasets through human subjects
and face retrieval. Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed model.]]></summary>

promise in many applications in Bayesian statistics as an alternative or
complement to MCMC for sampling posteriors. Since no data set from the target
posterior distribution is available beforehand, the flow is typically trained
using the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence that only requires samples
from a base distribution. This strategy may perform poorly when the posterior
is complicated and hard to sample with an untrained normalizing flow. Here we
explore a distinct training strategy, using the direct KL divergence as loss,
in which samples from the posterior are generated by (i) assisting a local MCMC
algorithm on the posterior with a normalizing flow to accelerate its mixing
rate and (ii) using the data generated this way to train the flow. The method
only requires a limited amount of \textit{a~priori} input about the posterior,
and can be used to estimate the evidence required for model validation, as we
illustrate on examples.]]></summary>

chromospheric fibrils in Halpha images of solar observations. Our method
consists of a data pre-processing component that prepares training data from a
threshold-based tool, a deep learning model implemented as a Bayesian
convolutional neural network for probabilistic image segmentation with
uncertainty quantification to predict fibrils, and a post-processing component
containing a fibril-fitting algorithm to determine fibril orientations. The
FibrilNet tool is applied to high-resolution Halpha images from an active
region (AR 12665) collected by the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope (GST) equipped
with high-order adaptive optics at the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). We
quantitatively assess the FibrilNet tool, comparing its image segmentation
algorithm and fibril-fitting algorithm with those employed by the
threshold-based tool. Our experimental results and major findings are
summarized as follows. First, the image segmentation results (i.e., detected
fibrils) of the two tools are quite similar, demonstrating the good learning
capability of FibrilNet. Second, FibrilNet finds more accurate and smoother
fibril orientation angles than the threshold-based tool. Third, FibrilNet is
faster than the threshold-based tool and the uncertainty maps produced by
FibrilNet not only provide a quantitative way to measure the confidence on each
detected fibril, but also help identify fibril structures that are not detected
by the threshold-based tool but are inferred through machine learning. Finally,
we apply FibrilNet to full-disk Halpha images from other solar observatories
and additional high-resolution Halpha images collected by BBSO/GST,

inter-cluster reliability of multidimensional projection (MDP), specifically
how well the inter-cluster structures are preserved between the original
high-dimensional space and the low-dimensional projection space. Measuring
inter-cluster reliability is crucial as it directly affects how well
inter-cluster tasks (e.g., identifying cluster relationships in the original
space from a projected view) can be conducted; however, despite the importance
of inter-cluster tasks, we found that previous metrics, such as Trustworthiness
and Continuity, fail to measure inter-cluster reliability. Our metrics consider
two aspects of the inter-cluster reliability: Steadiness measures the extent to
which clusters in the projected space form clusters in the original space, and
Cohesiveness measures the opposite. They extract random clusters with arbitrary
shapes and positions in one space and evaluate how much the clusters are
stretched or dispersed in the other space. Furthermore, our metrics can
quantify pointwise distortions, allowing for the visualization of inter-cluster
reliability in a projection, which we call a reliability map. Through
quantitative experiments, we verify that our metrics precisely capture the
distortions that harm inter-cluster reliability while previous metrics have
difficulty capturing the distortions. A case study also demonstrates that our
metrics and the reliability map 1) support users in selecting the proper
projection techniques or hyperparameters and 2) prevent misinterpretation while
performing inter-cluster tasks, thus allow an adequate identification of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The deviation between chronological age and age predicted from neuroimaging
data has been identified as a sensitive risk-marker of cross-disorder brain
changes, growing into a cornerstone of biological age-research. However,
Machine Learning models underlying the field do not consider uncertainty,
thereby confounding results with training data density and variability. Also,
existing models are commonly based on homogeneous training sets, often not
independently validated, and cannot be shared due to data protection issues.
Here, we introduce an uncertainty-aware, shareable, and transparent Monte-Carlo
Dropout Composite-Quantile-Regression (MCCQR) Neural Network trained on
N=10,691 datasets from the German National Cohort. The MCCQR model provides
robust, distribution-free uncertainty quantification in high-dimensional
neuroimaging data, achieving lower error rates compared to existing models
across ten recruitment centers and in three independent validation samples
(N=4,004). In two examples, we demonstrate that it prevents spurious
associations and increases power to detect accelerated brain-aging. We make the
pre-trained model publicly available.]]></summary>

series. These are data collected over a network of sensors (typically a set of
spatial locations), recording, over time, observations of multiple
measurements. From such data, we propose to learn, in an online fashion, a
graph that captures two aspects of dependency: one describing the sparse
spatial relationship between sensors, and the other characterizing the
measurement relationship. To this purpose, we introduce a novel multivariate
autoregressive model to infer the graph topology encoded in the coefficient
matrix which captures the sparse Granger causality dependency structure present
in such matrix-valued time series. We decompose the graph by imposing a
Kronecker sum structure on the coefficient matrix. We develop two online
approaches to learn the graph in a recursive way. The first one uses Wald test
for the projected OLS estimation, where we derive the asymptotic distribution
for the estimator. For the second one, we formalize a Lasso-type optimization
problem. We rely on homotopy algorithms to derive updating rules for estimating
the coefficient matrix. Furthermore, we provide an adaptive tuning procedure
for the regularization parameter. Numerical experiments using both synthetic
and real data, are performed to support the effectiveness of the proposed
learning approaches.]]></summary>

of material properties is of immense importance for the success and reliability

this work we compare 3 different approaches to obtain such individual

investigated using the Quantile loss function, machine learning the prediction
intervals directly and using Gaussian Processes. We identify each approachs
advantages and disadvantages and end up slightly favoring the modeling of the
individual uncertainties directly, as it is the easiest to fit and, in most

models with well-chosen learning biases. Recent innovations embed the
Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalisms into neural networks and demonstrate a
significant improvement over other approaches in predicting trajectories of
physical systems. These methods generally tackle autonomous systems that depend
implicitly on time or systems for which a control signal is known apriori.
Despite this success, many real world dynamical systems are non-autonomous,
driven by time-dependent forces and experience energy dissipation. In this
study, we address the challenge of learning from such non-autonomous systems by
embedding the port-Hamiltonian formalism into neural networks, a versatile
framework that can capture energy dissipation and time-dependent control
forces. We show that the proposed \emph{port-Hamiltonian neural network} can
efficiently learn the dynamics of nonlinear physical systems of practical
interest and accurately recover the underlying stationary Hamiltonian,
time-dependent force, and dissipative coefficient. A promising outcome of our
network is its ability to learn and predict chaotic systems such as the Duffing
equation, for which the trajectories are typically hard to learn.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have offered a powerful
new paradigm for solving problems relating to differential equations. Compared
to classical numerical methods PINNs have several advantages, for example their
ability to provide mesh-free solutions of differential equations and their
ability to carry out forward and inverse modelling within the same optimisation
problem. Whilst promising, a key limitation to date is that PINNs have
struggled to accurately and efficiently solve problems with large domains
and/or multi-scale solutions, which is crucial for their real-world
application. Multiple significant and related factors contribute to this issue,
including the increasing complexity of the underlying PINN optimisation problem
as the problem size grows and the spectral bias of neural networks. In this
work we propose a new, scalable approach for solving large problems relating to
differential equations called Finite Basis PINNs (FBPINNs). FBPINNs are
inspired by classical finite element methods, where the solution of the
differential equation is expressed as the sum of a finite set of basis
functions with compact support. In FBPINNs neural networks are used to learn
these basis functions, which are defined over small, overlapping subdomains.
FBINNs are designed to address the spectral bias of neural networks by using
separate input normalisation over each subdomain, and reduce the complexity of
the underlying optimisation problem by using many smaller neural networks in a
parallel divide-and-conquer approach. Our numerical experiments show that
FBPINNs are effective in solving both small and larger, multi-scale problems,
outperforming standard PINNs in both accuracy and computational resources
required, potentially paving the way to the application of PINNs on large,
real-world problems.]]></summary>

standard sense. Specifically, motivated by a recent flurry of activity on
non-Lipschitz (NoLips) optimization, we consider problems that are continuous
or smooth relative to a reference Bregman function - as opposed to a global,
ambient norm (Euclidean or otherwise). These conditions encompass a wide range
of problems with singular objectives, such as Fisher markets, Poisson
tomography, D-design, and the like. In this setting, the application of
existing order-optimal adaptive methods - like UnixGrad or AcceleGrad - is not
possible, especially in the presence of randomness and uncertainty. The
proposed method - which we call adaptive mirror descent (AdaMir) - aims to
close this gap by concurrently achieving min-max optimal rates in problems that
are relatively continuous or smooth, including stochastic ones.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In applications such as natural language processing or computer vision, one
is given a large $n \times d$ matrix $A = (a_{i,j})$ and would like to compute
a matrix decomposition, e.g., a low rank approximation, of a function $f(A) =
(f(a_{i,j}))$ applied entrywise to $A$. A very important special case is the
likelihood function $f\left( A \right ) = \log{\left( \left| a_{ij}\right|
+1\right)}$. A natural way to do this would be to simply apply $f$ to each
entry of $A$, and then compute the matrix decomposition, but this requires
storing all of $A$ as well as multiple passes over its entries. Recent work of
Liang et al.\ shows how to find a rank-$k$ factorization to $f(A)$ for an $n
\times n$ matrix $A$ using only $n \cdot \operatorname{poly}(\epsilon^{-1}k\log
n)$ words of memory, with overall error $10\|f(A)-[f(A)]_k\|_F^2 +
\operatorname{poly}(\epsilon/k) \|f(A)\|_{1,2}^2$, where $[f(A)]_k$ is the best
rank-$k$ approximation to $f(A)$ and $\|f(A)\|_{1,2}^2$ is the square of the
sum of Euclidean lengths of rows of $f(A)$. Their algorithm uses three passes
over the entries of $A$. The authors pose the open question of obtaining an
algorithm with $n \cdot \operatorname{poly}(\epsilon^{-1}k\log n)$ words of
memory using only a single pass over the entries of $A$. In this paper we
resolve this open question, obtaining the first single-pass algorithm for this
problem and for the same class of functions $f$ studied by Liang et al.
Moreover, our error is $\|f(A)-[f(A)]_k\|_F^2 + \operatorname{poly}(\epsilon/k)
\|f(A)\|_F^2$, where $\|f(A)\|_F^2$ is the sum of squares of Euclidean lengths
of rows of $f(A)$. Thus our error is significantly smaller, as it removes the
factor of $10$ and also $\|f(A)\|_F^2 \leq \|f(A)\|_{1,2}^2$. We also give an
algorithm for regression, pointing out an error in previous work, and
empirically validate our results.]]></summary>

This requires robustly identifying devices so that appropriate network security
policies can be applied. We address this challenge by exploring how to
accurately identify IoT devices based on their network behavior, while
leveraging approaches previously proposed by other researchers.

We compare the accuracy of four different previously proposed machine
learning models (tree-based and neural network-based) for identifying IoT
devices. We use packet trace data collected over a period of six months from a
large IoT test-bed. We show that, while all models achieve high accuracy when
evaluated on the same dataset as they were trained on, their accuracy degrades
over time, when evaluated on data collected outside the training set. We show
that on average the models' accuracy degrades after a couple of weeks by up to
40 percentage points (on average between 12 and 21 percentage points). We argue
that, in order to keep the models' accuracy at a high level, these need to be
continuously updated.]]></summary>

environments. The design of locomotion control is, however, still challenging.
Currently, controllers must be either manually designed for specific robots and
tasks, or automatically designed via machine learning methods that require long
training times and yield large opaque controllers. Drawing inspiration from
animal locomotion, we propose a simple yet versatile modular neural control
structure with fast learning. The key advantages of our approach are that
behavior-specific control modules can be added incrementally to obtain
increasingly complex emergent locomotion behaviors, and that neural connections
interfacing with existing modules can be quickly and automatically learned. In
a series of experiments, we show how eight modules can be quickly learned and
added to a base control module to obtain emergent adaptive behaviors allowing a
hexapod robot to navigate in complex environments. We also show that modules
can be added and removed during operation without affecting the functionality
of the remaining controller. Finally, the control approach was successfully

tackle this challenge, contrastive learning approaches are becoming
increasingly popular, given the impressive results they have achieved in
self-supervised representation learning settings. However, while most existing
contrastive anomaly detection and segmentation approaches have been applied to
images, none of them can use the contrastive losses directly for both anomaly
detection and segmentation. In this paper, we close this gap by making use of
the Contrastive Predictive Coding model (arXiv:1807.03748). We show that its

defense applied to various graph classification models, EGC$^2$ utilizes a
centrality-based edge importance index to compress graphs, filtering out
trivial structures and even adversarial perturbations of the input graphs, thus
improves its robustness. Experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate

events ordered as per the time of occurrence. Owing to their flexible nature,
TPPs have been used to model different scenarios and have shown applicability
in various real-world applications. While TPPs focus on modeling the event
occurrence, Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) focuses on modeling the
category/class of the event as well (termed as the marker). Research in MTPP
has garnered substantial attention over the past few years, with an extensive
focus on supervised algorithms. Despite the research focus, limited attention
has been given to the challenging problem of developing solutions in
semi-supervised settings, where algorithms have access to a mix of labeled and
unlabeled data. This research proposes a novel algorithm for Semi-supervised
Learning for Marked Temporal Point Processes (SSL-MTPP) applicable in such
scenarios. The proposed SSL-MTPP algorithm utilizes a combination of labeled

algorithm utilizes an RNN-based Encoder-Decoder module for learning effective
representations of the time sequence. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm
has been demonstrated via multiple protocols on the Retweet dataset, where the

computational challenges due to their high-dimensionality and data-sparsity,
also known as `dropout' events. Recently, Regularized Auto-Encoder (RAE) based
deep neural network models have achieved remarkable success in learning robust
low-dimensional representations. The basic idea in RAEs is to learn a
non-linear mapping from the high-dimensional data space to a low-dimensional
latent space and vice-versa, simultaneously imposing a distributional prior on
the latent space, which brings in a regularization effect. This paper argues
that RAEs suffer from the infamous problem of bias-variance trade-off in their
naive formulation. While a simple AE without a latent regularization results in
data over-fitting, a very strong prior leads to under-representation and thus
bad clustering. To address the above issues, we propose a modified RAE
framework (called the scRAE) for effective clustering of the single-cell RNA
sequencing data. scRAE consists of deterministic AE with a flexibly learnable
prior generator network, which is jointly trained with the AE. This facilitates
scRAE to trade-off better between the bias and variance in the latent space. We
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through extensive
experimentation on several real-world single-cell Gene expression datasets.]]></summary>

underlying physical dynamics. We work with models which are object-centric,
i.e., explicitly work with object representations, and propagate a loss in the
latent space. Specifically, our research builds on recent work by Kipf et al.
\cite{kipf&al20}, which predicts the next state via contrastive learning of
object interactions in a latent space using a Graph Neural Network. We argue
that injecting explicit inductive bias in the model, in form of general
physical laws, can help not only make the model more interpretable, but also
improve the overall prediction of model. As a natural by-product, our model can
learn feature maps which closely resemble actual object positions in the image,
without having any explicit supervision about the object positions at the
training time. In comparison with earlier works \cite{jaques&al20}, which
assume a complete knowledge of the dynamics governing the motion in the form of
a physics engine, we rely only on the knowledge of general physical laws, such
as, world consists of objects, which have position and velocity. We propose an
additional decoder based loss in the pixel space, imposed in a curriculum
manner, to further refine the latent space predictions. Experiments in multiple
different settings demonstrate that while Kipf et al. model is effective at
capturing object interactions, our model can be significantly more effective at
localising objects, resulting in improved performance in 3 out of 4 domains
that we experiment with. Additionally, our model can learn highly intrepretable

compared to the optimal control in hindsight. Some models cannot be stabilized
even with perfect knowledge of their coefficients: the robustness is limited by
the minimal distance between the assumed dynamics and the set of unstabilizable
dynamics. Therefore it is necessary to assume a lower bound on this distance.
Under this assumption, and with full observation of the $d$ dimensional state,
we describe an efficient controller that attains $\Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}})$

stochastic systems with both additive and multiplicative noises, using

off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm, named optimistic

find near-optimal policies of the optimal stationary control problem directly
from input/state data without explicitly identifying any system matrices,
starting from an initial admissible control policy. The solutions given by the

predictors of mortality in critically ill patients. Identifying patients whose
serum lactate levels are more likely to increase can alert physicians to
intensify care and guide them in the frequency of tending the blood test. We
investigate whether machine learning models can predict subsequent serum
lactate changes.

Methods. We investigated serum lactate change prediction using the MIMIC-III
and eICU-CRD datasets in internal as well as external validation of the eICU
cohort on the MIMIC-III cohort. Three subgroups were defined based on the
initial lactate levels: i) normal group (<2 mmol/L), ii) mild group (2-4
mmol/L), and iii) severe group (>4 mmol/L). Outcomes were defined based on
increase or decrease of serum lactate levels between the groups. We also
performed sensitivity analysis by defining the outcome as lactate change of
>10% and furthermore investigated the influence of the time interval between
subsequent lactate measurements on predictive performance.

Results. The LSTM models were able to predict deterioration of serum lactate
values of MIMIC-III patients with an AUC of 0.77 (95% CI 0.762-0.771) for the
normal group, 0.77 (95% CI 0.768-0.772) for the mild group, and 0.85 (95% CI
0.840-0.851) for the severe group, with a slightly lower performance in the
external validation.

Conclusion. The LSTM demonstrated good discrimination of patients who had
deterioration in serum lactate levels. Clinical studies are needed to evaluate
whether utilization of a clinical decision support tool based on these results
could positively impact decision-making and patient outcomes.]]></summary>

Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization brings advantages to Reinforcement
Learning (RL) algorithms by canceling out errors under mild assumptions.
However, existing analyses focus on fixed regularization with a constant
weighting coefficient and have not considered the case where the coefficient is
allowed to change dynamically. In this paper, we study the dynamic coefficient
scheme and present the first asymptotic error bound. Based on the dynamic
coefficient error bound, we propose an effective scheme to tune the coefficient
according to the magnitude of error in favor of more robust learning. On top of
this development, we propose a novel algorithm: Geometric Value Iteration (GVI)
that features a dynamic error-aware KL coefficient design aiming to mitigate
the impact of errors on the performance. Our experiments demonstrate that GVI
can effectively exploit the trade-off between learning speed and robustness
over uniform averaging of constant KL coefficient. The combination of GVI and
deep networks shows stable learning behavior even in the absence of a target
network where algorithms with a constant KL coefficient would greatly oscillate

(ML) for predictive modelling. Such systems may suffer from the cold-start
problem: supervised models work well but, initially, there are no labels, which
are costly or slow to obtain. This problem is even worse in imbalanced data
scenarios. Online financial fraud detection is an example where labeling is: i)
expensive, or ii) it suffers from long delays, if relying on victims filing
complaints. The latter may not be viable if a model has to be in place
immediately, so an option is to ask analysts to label events while minimizing
the number of annotations to control costs. We propose an Active Learning (AL)
annotation system for datasets with orders of magnitude of class imbalance, in
a cold start streaming scenario. We present a computationally efficient
Outlier-based Discriminative AL approach (ODAL) and design a novel 3-stage
sequence of AL labeling policies where it is used as warm-up. Then, we perform
empirical studies in four real world datasets, with various magnitudes of class
imbalance. The results show that our method can more quickly reach a high
performance model than standard AL policies. Its observed gains over random
sampling can reach 80% and be competitive with policies with an unlimited
annotation budget or additional historical data (with 1/10 to 1/50 of the
labels).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an essential element for the diagnosis and rehabilitation of psychiatric
disorders, the electroencephalogram (EEG) based emotion recognition has
achieved significant progress due to its high precision and reliability.
However, one obstacle to practicality lies in the variability between subjects
and sessions. Although several studies have adopted domain adaptation (DA)
approaches to tackle this problem, most of them treat multiple EEG data from
different subjects and sessions together as a single source domain for
transfer, which either fails to satisfy the assumption of domain adaptation
that the source has a certain marginal distribution, or increases the
difficulty of adaptation. We therefore propose the multi-source marginal
distribution adaptation (MS-MDA) for EEG emotion recognition, which takes both
domain-invariant and domain-specific features into consideration. First, we
assume that different EEG data share the same low-level features, then we
construct independent branches for multiple EEG data source domains to adopt
one-to-one domain adaptation and extract domain-specific features. Finally, the
inference is made by multiple branches. We evaluate our method on SEED and
SEED-IV for recognizing three and four emotions, respectively. Experimental
results show that the MS-MDA outperforms the comparison methods and
state-of-the-art models in cross-session and cross-subject transfer scenarios
in our settings. Codes at https://github.com/VoiceBeer/MS-MDA.]]></summary>

protocols treat each training point uniformly. Each example is propagated
forward and backward through the network the same amount of times, independent
of how much the example contributes to the learning protocol. Recent work has
proposed ways to accelerate training by deviating from this uniform treatment.
Popular methods entail up-weighting examples that contribute more to the loss
with the intuition that examples with low loss have already been learned by the
model, so their marginal value to the training procedure should be lower. This
view assumes that updating the model with high loss examples will be beneficial
to the model. However, this may not hold for noisy, real world data. In this
paper, we theorize and then empirically demonstrate that loss-based
acceleration methods degrade in scenarios with noisy and corrupted data. Our

power systems with high-penetration renewables. Based on big historical data, a
novel federated deep generative learning framework, called Fed-LSGAN, is
proposed by integrating federated learning and least square generative
adversarial networks (LSGANs) for renewable scenario generation. Specifically,
federated learning learns a shared global model in a central server from
renewable sites at network edges, which enables the Fed-LSGAN to generate
scenarios in a privacy-preserving manner without sacrificing the generation
quality by transferring model parameters, rather than all data. Meanwhile, the
LSGANs-based deep generative model generates scenarios that conform to the
distribution of historical data through fully capturing the spatial-temporal
characteristics of renewable powers, which leverages the least squares loss
function to improve the training stability and generation quality. The
simulation results demonstrate that the proposal manages to generate

activating non overlapping populations of neurons for different odors. In the
second layer, only the synapses between odor activated neurons and the output
neuron associated with the odor are modified during learning; the rest of the
weights are frozen to prevent unrelated memories from being overwritten. We
show empirically and analytically that this simple and lightweight algorithm
significantly boosts continual learning performance. The fly associative
learning algorithm is strikingly similar to the classic perceptron learning
algorithm, albeit two modifications, which we show are critical for reducing

pipeline for understanding specific rhythm irregularities. Deep neural networks
have become a popular technique for tracing ECG signals, outperforming human

precision. Moreover, they do not generalize well on the out-of-distribution
dataset. The GAN architecture has been employed in recent works to synthesize
adversarial ECG signals to increase existing training data. However, they use a
disjointed CNN-based classification architecture to detect arrhythmia. Till
now, no versatile architecture has been proposed that can detect adversarial
examples and classify arrhythmia simultaneously. To alleviate this, we propose
a novel Conditional Generative Adversarial Network to simultaneously generate
ECG signals for different categories and detect cardiac abnormalities.
Moreover, the model is conditioned on class-specific ECG signals to synthesize
realistic adversarial examples. Consequently, we compare our architecture and
show how it outperforms other classification models in normal/abnormal ECG

been stopped. To mitigate the spread of deadly coronavirus, many offices took
the initiative so that the employees can work from home. But, tracking the
employees and finding out if they are really performing what they were supposed
to turn out to be a serious challenge for all the companies and organizations
who are facilitating "Work From Home". To deal with the challenge effectively,
we came up with a solution to track the employees with face recognition. We
have been testing this system experimentally for our office. To train the face
recognition module, we used FaceNet with KNN using the Labeled Faces in the
Wild (LFW) dataset and achieved 97.8% accuracy. We integrated the trained model
into our central system, where the employees log their time. In this paper, we
discuss in brief the system we have been experimenting with and the pros and

representation learning for multivariate time series, with techniques for deep
anomaly detection originally developed for computer vision that we tailor to
the time series setting. Our window-based approach facilitates learning the
boundary between normal and anomalous classes by injecting generic synthetic
anomalies into the available data. Moreover, our method can effectively take

recovers the Hilbert--Schmidt distribution exactly, offering an alternative and

machine-learning-based quantum state tomography systems and Bayesian quantum

of quantum states generated by both a cloud-accessed IBM quantum computer and
an in-house source of polarization-entangled photons. In each case, our method

relationships/links between them in form images. The proposed FUDGE model
formulates this problem on a graph of text elements (the vertices) and uses a
Graph Convolutional Network to predict changes to the graph. The initial
vertices are detected text lines and do not necessarily correspond to the final
text entities, which can span multiple lines. Also, initial edges contain many
false-positive relationships. FUDGE edits the graph structure by combining text
segments (graph vertices) and pruning edges in an iterative fashion to obtain
the final text entities and relationships. While recent work in this area has
focused on leveraging large-scale pre-trained Language Models (LM), FUDGE
achieves almost the same level of entity linking performance on the FUNSD
dataset by learning only visual features from the (small) provided training
set. FUDGE can be applied on forms where text recognition is difficult (e.g.
degraded or historical forms) and on forms in resource-poor languages where
pre-training such LMs is challenging. FUDGE is state-of-the-art on the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clustering and visualizing high-dimensional (HD) data are important tasks in
a variety of fields. For example, in bioinformatics, they are crucial for
analyses of single-cell data such as mass cytometry (CyTOF) data. Some of the
most effective algorithms for clustering HD data are based on representing the
data by nodes in a graph, with edges connecting neighbouring nodes according to
some measure of similarity or distance. However, users of graph-based
algorithms are typically faced with the critical but challenging task of
choosing the value of an input parameter that sets the size of neighbourhoods
in the graph, e.g. the number of nearest neighbours to which to connect each
node or a threshold distance for connecting nodes. The burden on the user could
be alleviated by a measure of inter-node similarity that can have value 0 for
dissimilar nodes without requiring any user-defined parameters or thresholds.
This would determine the neighbourhoods automatically while still yielding a
sparse graph. To this end, I propose a new method called ASTRICS to measure
similarity between clusters of HD data points based on local dimensionality
reduction and triangulation of critical alpha shapes. I show that my ASTRICS
similarity measure can facilitate both clustering and visualization of HD data
by using it in Stage 2 of a three-stage pipeline: Stage 1 = perform an initial
clustering of the data by any method; Stage 2 = let graph nodes represent
initial clusters instead of individual data points and use ASTRICS to
automatically define edges between nodes; Stage 3 = use the graph for further
clustering and visualization. This trades the critical task of choosing a graph
neighbourhood size for the easier task of essentially choosing a resolution at
which to view the data. The graph and consequently downstream clustering and
visualization are then automatically adapted to the chosen resolution.]]></summary>

resulting pain behavior also is subtle, sparsely appearing, and varying, making
it challenging for even an expert human labeler to provide accurate

horses with acute nociceptive pain (where labeling is less ambiguous) can aid
the learning to recognize more complex orthopedic pain. Moreover, we present a
human expert baseline for the problem, as well as an extensive empirical study
of various domain transfer methods and of what is detected by the pain
recognition method trained on acute pain in the orthopedic dataset. Finally,
this is accompanied with a discussion around the challenges posed by real-world

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta-learning provides a popular and effective family of methods for
data-efficient learning of new tasks. However, several important issues in
meta-learning have proven hard to study thus far. For example, performance
degrades in real-world settings where meta-learners must learn from a wide and
potentially multi-modal distribution of training tasks; and when distribution
shift exists between meta-train and meta-test task distributions. These issues
are typically hard to study since the shape of task distributions, and shift
between them are not straightforward to measure or control in standard
benchmarks. We propose the channel coding problem as a benchmark for
meta-learning. Channel coding is an important practical application where task
distributions naturally arise, and fast adaptation to new tasks is practically
valuable. We use this benchmark to study several aspects of meta-learning,
including the impact of task distribution breadth and shift, which can be
controlled in the coding problem. Going forward, this benchmark provides a tool
for the community to study the capabilities and limitations of meta-learning,
and to drive research on practically robust and effective meta-learners.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A novel energy-efficient edge computing paradigm is proposed for real-time
deep learning-based image upsampling applications. State-of-the-art deep
learning solutions for image upsampling are currently trained using either
resize or sub-pixel convolution to learn kernels that generate high fidelity
images with minimal artifacts. However, performing inference with these learned
convolution kernels requires memory-intensive feature map transformations that
dominate time and energy costs in real-time applications. To alleviate this
pressure on memory bandwidth, we confine the use of resize or sub-pixel
convolution to training in the cloud by transforming learned convolution
kernels to deconvolution kernels before deploying them for inference as a
functionally equivalent deconvolution. These kernel transformations, intended
as a one-time cost when shifting from training to inference, enable a systems
designer to use each algorithm in their optimal context by preserving the image
fidelity learned when training in the cloud while minimizing data transfer
penalties during inference at the edge. We also explore existing variants of
deconvolution inference algorithms and introduce a novel variant for
consideration. We analyze and compare the inference properties of
convolution-based upsampling algorithms using a quantitative model of incurred
time and energy costs and show that using deconvolution for inference at the
edge improves both system latency and energy efficiency when compared to their
sub-pixel or resize convolution counterparts.]]></summary>

we argue that this might lead to biased progress in the community. We discuss

machine learning issues. However, there exists many local minimums and saddle
points in the loss function, especially for high dimensional non-convex
optimization problems like deep learning. Gradient descent may make loss
function trapped in these local intervals which impedes further optimization,
resulting in poor generalization ability. This paper proposes the SA-GD
algorithm which introduces the thought of simulated annealing algorithm to
gradient descent. SA-GD method offers model the ability of mounting hills in
probability, tending to enable the model to jump out of these local areas and
converge to a optimal state finally. We took CNN models as an example and
tested the basic CNN models on various benchmark datasets. Compared to the
baseline models with traditional gradient descent algorithm, models with SA-GD
algorithm possess better generalization ability without sacrificing the
efficiency and stability of model convergence. In addition, SA-GD can be

material structure using compressive sensing based multiple-input and
multiple-output (MIMO) wireless radar. Here, the strong clutter due to the
reflection of the layered structure's surface often makes the detection of the
defects challenging. Thus, sophisticated signal separation methods are required
for improved defect detection. In many scenarios, the number of defects that we
are interested in is limited and the signaling response of the layered
structure can be modeled as a low-rank structure. Therefore, we propose joint
rank and sparsity minimization for defect detection. In particular, we propose
a non-convex approach based on the iteratively reweighted nuclear and
$\ell_1-$norm (a double-reweighted approach) to obtain a higher accuracy
compared to the conventional nuclear norm and $\ell_1-$norm minimization. To
this end, an iterative algorithm is designed to estimate the low-rank and
sparse contributions. Further, we propose deep learning to learn the parameters
of the algorithm (i.e., algorithm unfolding) to improve the accuracy and the
speed of convergence of the algorithm. Our numerical results show that the
proposed approach outperforms the conventional approaches in terms of mean

methods focus on searching for one single accurate and robust architecture. To
further build models with better generalization capability and performance,
model ensemble is usually adopted and performs better than stand-alone models.
Inspired by the merits of model ensemble, we propose to search for multiple
diverse models simultaneously as an alternative way to find powerful models.
Searching for ensembles is non-trivial and has two key challenges: enlarged
search space and potentially more complexity for the searched model. In this
paper, we propose a one-shot neural ensemble architecture search (NEAS)
solution that addresses the two challenges. For the first challenge, we
introduce a novel diversity-based metric to guide search space shrinking,
considering both the potentiality and diversity of candidate operators. For the
second challenge, we enable a new search dimension to learn layer sharing among
different models for efficiency purposes. The experiments on ImageNet clearly
demonstrate that our solution can improve the supernet's capacity of ranking
ensemble architectures, and further lead to better search results. The
discovered architectures achieve superior performance compared with
state-of-the-arts such as MobileNetV3 and EfficientNet families under aligned
settings. Moreover, we evaluate the generalization ability and robustness of
our searched architecture on the COCO detection benchmark and achieve a 3.1%
improvement on AP compared with MobileNetV3. Codes and models are available at

accuracy of candidate architectures has drawn increasing attention due to its
simplicity and effectiveness. Previous works usually employ neural
network-based predictors which require more delicate design and are easy to
overfit. Considering that most architectures are represented as sequences of
discrete symbols which are more like tabular data and preferred by non-neural
predictors, in this paper, we study an alternative approach which uses
non-neural model for accuracy prediction. Specifically, as decision tree based
models can better handle tabular data, we leverage gradient boosting decision
tree (GBDT) as the predictor for NAS. We demonstrate that the GBDT predictor
can achieve comparable (if not better) prediction accuracy than neural network
based predictors. Moreover, considering that a compact search space can ease
the search process, we propose to prune the search space gradually according to
important features derived from GBDT. In this way, NAS can be performed by
first pruning the search space and then searching a neural architecture, which
is more efficient and effective. Experiments on NASBench-101 and ImageNet
demonstrate the effectiveness of using GBDT as predictor for NAS: (1) On
NASBench-101, it is 22x, 8x, and 6x more sample efficient than random search,
regularized evolution, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in finding the global
optimum; (2) It achieves 24.2% top-1 error rate on ImageNet, and further
achieves 23.4% top-1 error rate on ImageNet when enhanced with search space
pruning. Code is provided in the supplementary materials.]]></summary>

generate diverse high-fidelity images. In particular, layout-to-image
generation models have gained significant attention due to their capability to
generate realistic complex images containing distinct objects. These models are
generally conditioned on either semantic layouts or textual descriptions.
However, unlike natural images, providing auxiliary information can be
extremely hard in domains such as biomedical imaging and remote sensing. In
this work, we propose a multi-object generation framework that can synthesize
images with multiple objects without explicitly requiring their contextual
information during the generation process. Based on a vector-quantized
variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) backbone, our model learns to preserve spatial
coherency within an image as well as semantic coherency between the objects and
the background through two powerful autoregressive priors: PixelSNAIL and
LayoutPixelSNAIL. While the PixelSNAIL learns the distribution of the latent
encodings of the VQ-VAE, the LayoutPixelSNAIL is used to specifically learn the
semantic distribution of the objects. An implicit advantage of our approach is
that the generated samples are accompanied by object-level annotations. We
demonstrate how coherency and fidelity are preserved with our method through
experiments on the Multi-MNIST and CLEVR datasets; thereby outperforming
state-of-the-art multi-object generative methods. The efficacy of our approach
is demonstrated through application on medical imaging datasets, where we show
that augmenting the training set with generated samples using our approach
improves the performance of existing models.]]></summary>

practical applications. Despite the difficulty of detecting kinship, annual
data challenges using still-images have consistently improved performances and
attracted new researchers. Now, systems reach performance levels unforeseeable
a decade ago, closing in on performances acceptable to deploy in practice.
Similar to other biometric tasks, we expect systems can benefit from additional
modalities. We hypothesize that adding modalities to FIW, which contains only
still-images, will improve performance. Thus, to narrow the gap between
research and reality and enhance the power of kinship recognition systems, we
extend FIW with multimedia (MM) data (i.e., video, audio, and text captions).
Specifically, we introduce the first publicly available multi-task MM kinship
dataset. To build FIW MM, we developed machinery to automatically collect,
annotate, and prepare the data, requiring minimal human input and no financial
cost. The proposed MM corpus allows the problem statements to be more realistic
template-based protocols. We show significant improvements in all benchmarks
with the added modalities. The results highlight edge cases to inspire future
research with different areas of improvement. FIW MM provides the data required
to increase the potential of automated systems to detect kinship in MM. It also
allows experts from diverse fields to collaborate in novel ways.]]></summary>

translation, but their high computational and storage costs impede the
deployment on mobile devices. Prevalent methods for CNN compression cannot be
directly applied to GANs due to the complicated generator architecture and the
unstable adversarial training. To solve these, in this paper, we introduce a
novel GAN compression method, termed DMAD, by proposing a Differentiable Mask
and a co-Attention Distillation. The former searches for a light-weight
generator architecture in a training-adaptive manner. To overcome channel
inconsistency when pruning the residual connections, an adaptive cross-block
group sparsity is further incorporated. The latter simultaneously distills
informative attention maps from both the generator and discriminator of a
pre-trained model to the searched generator, effectively stabilizing the
adversarial training of our light-weight model. Experiments show that DMAD can
reduce the Multiply Accumulate Operations (MACs) of CycleGAN by 13$\times$ and
that of Pix2Pix by 4$\times$ while retaining a comparable performance against
the full model. Our code can be available at https://github.com/SJLeo/DMAD.]]></summary>

the driving scenarios. Autonomous vehicles (AV) are similarly becoming involved
in the process. Nowadays, the development of AV in urban places underpins
essential safety concerns for vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians.
Therefore, to make the roads safer, it is critical to classify and predict
their future behavior. In this paper, we present a framework based on multiple
variations of the Transformer models to reason attentively about the dynamic
evolution of the pedestrians' past trajectory and predict its future actions of
crossing or not crossing the street. We proved that using only bounding boxes
as input to our model can outperform the previous state-of-the-art models and
reach a prediction accuracy of 91 % and an F1-score of 0.83 on the PIE dataset
up to two seconds ahead in the future. In addition, we introduced a large-size
simulated dataset (CP2A) using CARLA for action prediction. Our model has
similarly reached high accuracy (91 %) and F1-score (0.91) on this dataset.
Interestingly, we showed that pre-training our Transformer model on the
simulated dataset and then fine-tuning it on the real dataset can be very
effective for the action prediction task.]]></summary>

between human vocal characteristics and facial features. However, existing
approaches generate faces simply from voice, without exploring the set of
features that contribute to these observed correlations. A computational
methodology to explore this can be devised by rephrasing the question to: "how
much would a target face have to change in order to be perceived as the
originator of a source voice?" With this in perspective, we propose a framework
to morph a target face in response to a given voice in a way that facial
features are implicitly guided by learned voice-face correlation in this paper.
Our framework includes a guided autoencoder that converts one face to another,
controlled by a unique model-conditioning component called a gating controller
which modifies the reconstructed face based on input voice recordings. We
evaluate the framework on VoxCelab and VGGFace datasets through human subjects
and face retrieval. Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed model.]]></summary>

synthesis of new video clips from old ones, with several new key elements for
improved spatial resolution and realism: It conditions the synthesis process on
contextual information for temporal continuity and ancillary information for
fine control. The prediction model is doubly autoregressive, in the latent
space of an autoencoder for forecasting, and in image space for updating
contextual information, which is also used to enforce spatio-temporal
consistency through a learnable optical flow module. Adversarial training of
the autoencoder in the appearance and temporal domains is used to further
improve the realism of its output. A quantizer inserted between the encoder and
the transformer in charge of forecasting future frames in latent space (and its
inverse inserted between the transformer and the decoder) adds even more
flexibility by affording simple mechanisms for handling multimodal ancillary
information for controlling the synthesis process (eg, a few sample frames, an
audio track, a trajectory in image space) and taking into account the
intrinsically uncertain nature of the future by allowing multiple predictions.
Experiments with an implementation of the proposed approach give very good
qualitative and quantitative results on multiple tasks and standard benchmarks.]]></summary>

However, the $1 \times 1$ convolution suffers from limited flexibility compared
to the standard convolutions. In this paper, we propose a novel invertible $n

forms of attention and applies it to different problems like classification,
detection or retrieval.

We present global-local attention module (GLAM), which is attached at the end

that our proposed method is competitive with other scale recovery techniques

challenging task. In particular, recovering information in over-exposed regions
is extremely difficult because details in such regions are almost completely
lost. In this paper, we present a deep learning based iTM method that takes
advantage of the feature extraction and mapping power of deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and uses a lightness prior to modulate the CNN to better
exploit observations in the surrounding areas of the over-exposed regions to
enhance the quality of HDR image reconstruction. Specifically, we introduce a
Hierarchical Synthesis Network (HiSN) for inferring a HDR image from a LDR
input and a Lightness Adpative Modulation Network (LAMN) to incorporate the the
lightness prior knowledge in the inferring process. The HiSN hierarchically
synthesizes the high-brightness component and the low-brightness component of
the HDR image whilst the LAMN uses a lightness adaptive mask that separates
detail-less saturated bright pixels from well-exposed lower light pixels to
enable HiSN to better infer the missing information, particularly in the
difficult over-exposed detail-less areas. We present experimental results to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the new technique based on quantitative
measures and visual comparisons. In addition, we present ablation studies of
HiSN and visualization of the activation maps inside LAMN to help gain a deeper
understanding of the internal working of the new iTM algorithm and explain why
it can achieve much improved performance over state-of-the-art algorithms.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Computer Vision (CV) has achieved remarkable results, outperforming humans in
several tasks. Nonetheless, it may result in major discrimination if not dealt
with proper care. CV systems highly depend on the data they are fed with and
can learn and amplify biases within such data. Thus, both the problems of
understanding and discovering biases are of utmost importance. Yet, to date
there is no comprehensive survey on bias in visual datasets. To this end, this
work aims to: i) describe the biases that can affect visual datasets; ii)
review the literature on methods for bias discovery and quantification in
visual datasets; iii) discuss existing attempts to collect bias-aware visual
datasets. A key conclusion of our study is that the problem of bias discovery
and quantification in visual datasets is still open and there is room for
improvement in terms of both methods and the range of biases that can be
addressed; moreover, there is no such thing as a bias-free dataset, so
scientists and practitioners must become aware of the biases in their datasets
and make them explicit. To this end, we propose a checklist that can be used to
spot different types of bias during visual dataset collection.]]></summary>

these characteristics, due to the fundamental challenge in integrating the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper presents a unified computational framework for the estimation of
distances, geodesics and barycenters of merge trees. We extend recent work on
the edit distance [106] and introduce a new metric, called the Wasserstein
distance between merge trees, which is purposely designed to enable efficient
computations of geodesics and barycenters. Specifically, our new distance is
strictly equivalent to the L2-Wasserstein distance between extremum persistence
diagrams, but it is restricted to a smaller solution space, namely, the space
of rooted partial isomorphisms between branch decomposition trees. This enables
a simple extension of existing optimization frameworks [112] for geodesics and
barycenters from persistence diagrams to merge trees. We introduce a task-based
algorithm which can be generically applied to distance, geodesic, barycenter or
cluster computation. The task-based nature of our approach enables further
accelerations with shared-memory parallelism. Extensive experiments on public
ensembles and SciVis contest benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency of our
approach -- with barycenter computations in the orders of minutes for the
largest examples -- as well as its qualitative ability to generate
representative barycenter merge trees, visually summarizing the features of
interest found in the ensemble. We show the utility of our contributions with
dedicated visualization applications: feature tracking, temporal reduction and
ensemble clustering. We provide a lightweight C++ implementation that can be
used to reproduce our results.]]></summary>

including agriculture, environmental and natural disasters monitoring. Most of
the work in the literature utilize traditional segmentation methods that
require a large amount of computational and storage resources. Deep learning
has transformed computer vision and dramatically improved machine translation,
though it requires massive dataset for training and significant resources for
inference. More importantly, energy-efficient embedded vision hardware
delivering real-time and robust performance is crucial in the aforementioned
application. In this work, we propose a U-Net based tree delineation method,
which is effectively trained using multi-spectral imagery but can then
delineate single-spectrum images. The deep architecture that also performs
localization, i.e., a class label corresponds to each pixel, has been
successfully used to allow training with a small set of segmented images. The
ground truth data were generated using traditional image denoising and
segmentation approaches. To be able to execute the proposed DNN efficiently in
embedded platforms designed for deep learning approaches, we employ traditional
model compression and acceleration methods. Extensive evaluation studies using
data collected from UAVs equipped with multi-spectral cameras demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed methods in terms of delineation accuracy and
execution efficiency.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To solve the issue of video dehazing, there are two main tasks to attain: how
to align adjacent frames to the reference frame; how to restore the reference
frame. Some papers adopt explicit approaches (e.g., the Markov random field,
optical flow, deformable convolution, 3D convolution) to align neighboring
frames with the reference frame in feature space or image space, they then use
various restoration methods to achieve the final dehazing results. In this
paper, we propose a progressive alignment and restoration method for video
dehazing. The alignment process aligns consecutive neighboring frames stage by
stage without using the optical flow estimation. The restoration process is not
only implemented under the alignment process but also uses a refinement network
to improve the dehazing performance of the whole network. The proposed networks
include four fusion networks and one refinement network. To decrease the
parameters of networks, three fusion networks in the first fusion stage share
the same parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed video
dehazing method achieves outstanding performance against the-state-of-art
methods.]]></summary>

3D representations of shape and motion. However, techniques such as cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging are conventionally limited to acquiring contiguous
cross-sectional slices with low through-plane resolution and potential
inter-slice spatial misalignment. Super-resolution in medical imaging aims to
increase the resolution of images but is conventionally trained on features
from low resolution datasets and does not super-resolve corresponding
segmentations. Here we propose a semi-supervised multi-task generative
adversarial network (Gemini-GAN) that performs joint super-resolution of the
images and their labels using a ground truth of high resolution 3D cines and
segmentations, while an unsupervised variational adversarial mixture
autoencoder (V-AMA) is used for continuous domain adaptation. Our proposed
approach is extensively evaluated on two transnational multi-ethnic populations
of 1,331 and 205 adults respectively, delivering an improvement on state of the
art methods in terms of Dice index, peak signal to noise ratio, and structural
similarity index measure. This framework also exceeds the performance of state
of the art generative domain adaptation models on external validation (Dice
index 0.81 vs 0.74 for the left ventricle). This demonstrates how joint
super-resolution and segmentation, trained on 3D ground-truth data with
cross-domain generalization, enables robust precision phenotyping in diverse

remote sensing community. A meaningful set of quantitative features reflecting
the geophysical properties help us better understand the formation and
evolution of rivers. Typically, river sub-basins are analysed using Cartosat
Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), obtained at regular time epochs. One of the
useful geophysical features of a river sub-basin is that of a roughness measure
on DEMs. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not much literature
available on theoretical analysis of roughness measures. In this article, we
revisit the roughness measure on DEM data adapted from multiscale
granulometries in mathematical morphology, namely multiscale directional
granulometric index (MDGI). This measure was classically used to obtain
shape-size analysis in greyscale images. In earlier works, MDGIs were
introduced to capture the characteristic surficial roughness of a river
sub-basin along specific directions. Also, MDGIs can be efficiently computed
and are known to be useful features for classification of river sub-basins. In
this article, we provide a theoretical analysis of a MDGI. In particular, we
characterize non-trivial sufficient conditions on the structure of DEMs under
which MDGIs are invariant. These properties are illustrated with some
fictitious DEMs. We also provide connections to a discrete derivative of volume
of a DEM. Based on these connections, we provide intuition as to why a MDGI is
considered a roughness measure. Further, we experimentally illustrate on
Lower-Indus, Wardha, and Barmer river sub-basins that the proposed features
capture the characteristics of the river sub-basin.]]></summary>

accurately plan and deliver radiotherapy and to measure treatment response.
This is particularly difficult for tumors located close to mediastium, due to
low soft-tissue contrast. Therefore, we developed a new cross-modality educed
distillation (CMEDL) approach, using unpaired CT and MRI scans, whereby a
teacher MRI network guides a student CT network to extract features that signal
the difference between foreground and background. Our contribution eliminates
two requirements of distillation methods: (i) paired image sets by using an
image to image (I2I) translation and (ii) pre-training of the teacher network
with a large training set by using concurrent training of all networks. Our
framework uses an end-to-end trained unpaired I2I translation, teacher, and
student segmentation networks. Our framework can be combined with any I2I and
segmentation network. We demonstrate our framework's feasibility using 3
segmentation and 2 I2I methods. All networks were trained with 377 CT and 82
T2w MRI from different sets of patients. Ablation tests and different
strategies for incorporating MRI information into CT were performed. Accuracy
was measured using Dice similarity (DSC), surface Dice (sDSC), and Hausdorff
distance at the 95$^{th}$ percentile (HD95). The CMEDL approach was
significantly (p $<$ 0.001) more accurate than non-CMEDL methods,
quantitatively and visually. It produced the highest segmentation accuracy
(sDSC of 0.83 $\pm$ 0.16 and HD95 of 5.20 $\pm$ 6.86mm). CMEDL was also more
accurate than using either pMRI's or the combination of CT's with pMRI's for

from a large-scale dataset to tackle a series of downstream classification
tasks. Typically, each task involves only few training examples from brand-new
categories. This requires the pretraining models to focus on well-generalizable
knowledge, but ignore domain-specific information. In this paper, we observe
that image background serves as a source of domain-specific knowledge, which is
a shortcut for models to learn in the source dataset, but is harmful when
adapting to brand-new classes. To prevent the model from learning this shortcut
knowledge, we propose COSOC, a novel Few-Shot Learning framework, to
automatically figure out foreground objects at both pretraining and evaluation
stage. COSOC is a two-stage algorithm motivated by the observation that
foreground objects from different images within the same class share more
similar patterns than backgrounds. At the pretraining stage, for each class, we
cluster contrastive-pretrained features of randomly cropped image patches, such
that crops containing only foreground objects can be identified by a single
cluster. We then force the pretraining model to focus on found foreground
objects by a fusion sampling strategy; at the evaluation stage, among images in
each training class of any few-shot task, we seek for shared contents and
filter out background. The recognized foreground objects of each class are used
to match foreground of testing images. Extensive experiments tailored to
inductive FSL tasks on two benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of our method.]]></summary>

mapping point clouds and triangle meshes that is robust against large fractions
of the indoor mapping geometries deviating from an ideal Manhattan World
structure. In the case of building structures that contain multiple Manhattan
World systems, the dominant Manhattan World structure supported by the largest
fraction of geometries is determined and used for alignment. In a first step, a
vertical alignment orienting a chosen axis to be orthogonal to horizontal floor
and ceiling surfaces is conducted. Subsequently, a rotation around the
resulting vertical axis is determined that aligns the dataset horizontally with
the coordinate axes. The proposed method is evaluated quantitatively against
several publicly available indoor mapping datasets. Our implementation of the
proposed procedure along with code for reproducing the evaluation will be made
available to the public upon acceptance for publication.]]></summary>

models in practice, but remains challenging due to the lack of labeled data. To
tackle this challenge, contrastive learning approaches are becoming
increasingly popular, given the impressive results they have achieved in
self-supervised representation learning settings. However, while most existing
contrastive anomaly detection and segmentation approaches have been applied to
images, none of them can use the contrastive losses directly for both anomaly
detection and segmentation. In this paper, we close this gap by making use of
the Contrastive Predictive Coding model (arXiv:1807.03748). We show that its
patch-wise contrastive loss can directly be interpreted as an anomaly score,
and how this allows for the creation of anomaly segmentation masks. The
resulting model achieves promising results for both anomaly detection and

for diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM). WB-MRI is used to detect sites of
disease across the entire skeletal system, but it requires significant
expertise and is time-consuming to report due to the great number of images. To
aid radiological reading, we propose an auxiliary task-based multiple instance
learning approach (ATMIL) for MM classification with the ability to localize
sites of disease. This approach is appealing as it only requires patient-level
annotations where an attention mechanism is used to identify local regions with
active disease. We borrow ideas from multi-task learning and define an
auxiliary task with adaptive reweighting to support and improve learning
efficiency in the presence of data scarcity. We validate our approach on both
synthetic and real multi-center clinical data. We show that the MIL attention
module provides a mechanism to localize bone regions while the adaptive

not data consistent, require in vivo training data or do not solve all steps of
the QSM processing pipeline. Here we aim to overcome these limitations and
developed a framework to solve the QSM processing steps jointly. We developed a
new hybrid training data generation method that enables the end-to-end training
for solving background field correction and dipole inversion in a
data-consistent fashion using a variational network that combines the QSM model

training on large-scale annotated datasets, which is not viable in many

representation learning in the case of fluorescent biological images. We show
that Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks combined with linear Support
Vector Machines enable high-throughput compound screening based on raw images.
We demonstrate this by classifying active and inactive compounds tested for the
inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in VERO and HRCE cell lines. In contrast to
previous methods, our deep learning based approach does not require any
annotation besides the one that is normally collected during the sample
preparation process. We test our technique on the RxRx19a Sars-CoV-2 image
collection. The dataset consists of fluorescent images that were generated to
assess the ability of regulatory-approved or in late-stage clinical trials
compound to modulate the in vitro infection from SARS-CoV-2 in both VERO and
HRCE cell lines. We show that our technique can be exploited not only for
classification tasks, but also to effectively derive a dose response curve for
the tested treatments, in a self-supervised manner. Lastly, we demonstrate its
generalization capabilities by successfully addressing a zero-shot learning
task, consisting in the categorization of four different cell types of the

designing localization systems, because they naturally integrate sequences of
imperfect motion and exteroceptive sensor data. Recently, probabilistic
localization systems utilizing appearance-invariant visual place recognition
(VPR) methods as the primary exteroceptive sensor have demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance in the presence of substantial appearance change.
However, existing systems 1) do not fully utilize odometry data within the
motion models, and 2) are unable to handle route deviations, due to the
assumption that query traverses exactly repeat the mapping traverse. To address
these shortcomings, we present a new probabilistic topometric localization
system which incorporates full 3-dof odometry into the motion model and
furthermore, adds an "off-map" state within the state-estimation framework,
allowing query traverses which feature significant route detours from the
reference map to be successfully localized. We perform extensive evaluation on
multiple query traverses from the Oxford RobotCar dataset exhibiting both
significant appearance change and deviations from routes previously traversed.
In particular, we evaluate performance on two practically relevant localization
tasks: loop closure detection and global localization. Our approach achieves
major performance improvements over both existing and improved state-of-the-art

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semantic segmentation for scene understanding is nowadays widely demanded,
raising significant challenges for the algorithm efficiency, especially its
applications on resource-limited platforms. Current segmentation models are
trained and evaluated on massive high-resolution scene images ("data level")
and suffer from the expensive computation arising from the required multi-scale
aggregation("network level"). In both folds, the computational and energy costs
in training and inference are notable due to the often desired large input
resolutions and heavy computational burden of segmentation models. To this end,
we propose DANCE, general automated DAta-Network Co-optimization for Efficient
segmentation model training and inference. Distinct from existing efficient
segmentation approaches that focus merely on light-weight network design, DANCE
distinguishes itself as an automated simultaneous data-network co-optimization
via both input data manipulation and network architecture slimming.
Specifically, DANCE integrates automated data slimming which adaptively
downsamples/drops input images and controls their corresponding contribution to
the training loss guided by the images' spatial complexity. Such a downsampling
operation, in addition to slimming down the cost associated with the input size
directly, also shrinks the dynamic range of input object and context scales,
therefore motivating us to also adaptively slim the network to match the
downsampled data. Extensive experiments and ablating studies (on four SOTA
segmentation models with three popular segmentation datasets under two training
settings) demonstrate that DANCE can achieve "all-win" towards efficient
segmentation(reduced training cost, less expensive inference, and better mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU)).]]></summary>

autonomous vehicle datasets designed to support common tasks in visual place
recognition research. The system includes functionality for loading,

images. It supports a number of commonly used driving datasets and can be
adapted to load custom datasets with minimal effort. OdoViz's design consists
of a slim server to serve the datasets coupled with a rich client frontend.
This design supports multiple deployment configurations including single user
stand-alone installations, research group installations serving datasets
internally across a lab, or publicly accessible web-frontends for providing
online interfaces for exploring and interacting with datasets. The tool allows
viewing complete vehicle trajectories traversed at multiple different time
periods simultaneously, facilitating tasks such as sub-sampling, comparing and
finding pose correspondences both across and within sequences. This
significantly reduces the effort required in creating subsets of data from
existing datasets for machine learning tasks. Further to the above, the system
also supports adding custom extensions and plugins to extend the capabilities
of the software for other potential data management, visualization and
processing tasks. The platform has been open-sourced to promote its use and

enabling unlabeled data to provide supervision signals. The proposed
object-oriented coordinate system can make 3D estimations equivariant to the
camera perspective. Experiments are conducted on FPHA and HO-3D datasets. Our
method reduces estimation error by 19.5% / 24.9% for hands/objects compared to
straightforward use of labeled data on FPHA and outperforms several baseline

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A novel energy-efficient edge computing paradigm is proposed for real-time
deep learning-based image upsampling applications. State-of-the-art deep
learning solutions for image upsampling are currently trained using either
resize or sub-pixel convolution to learn kernels that generate high fidelity
images with minimal artifacts. However, performing inference with these learned
convolution kernels requires memory-intensive feature map transformations that
dominate time and energy costs in real-time applications. To alleviate this
pressure on memory bandwidth, we confine the use of resize or sub-pixel
convolution to training in the cloud by transforming learned convolution
kernels to deconvolution kernels before deploying them for inference as a
functionally equivalent deconvolution. These kernel transformations, intended
as a one-time cost when shifting from training to inference, enable a systems
designer to use each algorithm in their optimal context by preserving the image
fidelity learned when training in the cloud while minimizing data transfer
penalties during inference at the edge. We also explore existing variants of
deconvolution inference algorithms and introduce a novel variant for
consideration. We analyze and compare the inference properties of
convolution-based upsampling algorithms using a quantitative model of incurred
time and energy costs and show that using deconvolution for inference at the
edge improves both system latency and energy efficiency when compared to their
sub-pixel or resize convolution counterparts.]]></summary>

a task setup more realistic to available resources, that circumvents document

compare and analyze methods that pivot through English: to map foreign queries
to English and then English answers back to target language answers. Within
this task setup we propose Reranked Multilingual Maximal Inner Product Search
(RM-MIPS), akin to semantic similarity retrieval over the English training set
with reranking, which outperforms the strongest baselines by 2.7% on XQuAD and
6.2% on MKQA. Analysis demonstrates the particular efficacy of this strategy
over state-of-the-art alternatives in challenging settings: low-resource

the efficacy of pseudo-labeling for semi-supervised models trained both with

losses. Iterative Pseudo-Labeling (IPL), which continuously trains a single
model using pseudo-labels iteratively re-generated as the model learns, has
been shown to further improve performance in ASR. We improve upon the IPL
algorithm: as the model learns, we propose to iteratively re-generate
transcriptions with hard labels (the most probable tokens), that is, without a
language model. We call this approach Language-Model-Free IPL (slimIPL) and
give a resultant training setup for low-resource settings with CTC-based
models. slimIPL features a dynamic cache for pseudo-labels which reduces
sensitivity to changes in relabeling hyperparameters and results in improves
training stability. slimIPL is also highly-efficient and requires 3.5-4x fewer
computational resources to converge than other state-of-the-art
semi/self-supervised approaches. With only 10 hours of labeled audio, slimIPL
is competitive with self-supervised approaches, and is state-of-the-art with

crucial for many real-world machine learning tasks. A challenging aspect of
this problem is that the quality of crowdsourced labels suffer high intra- and

existing supervised language representation learning algorithms may yield
suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \emph{TACMA}, a

heuristic for \underline{c}rowdsourced labels with \underline{m}ultiple

intra-observer variability with attention mechanism; (2) computes and
aggregates per-sample confidence scores from multiple workers to address the
inter-observer disagreements. The proposed heuristic is extremely easy to
implement in around 5 lines of code. The proposed heuristic is evaluated on
four synthetic and four real-world data sets. The results show that our
approach outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines in terms of

design a novel interaction module that not only iteratively incorporates
personalized knowledge into each turn conversation but also captures the
personality-related information from conversation to enhance personalized
knowledge semantic representation. From the view of speaking style, we
introduce the speaking style vector and feed it into the decoder to keep the
speaking style consistency. To avoid conversation repetition, we devise a
coverage mechanism to keep track of the activation of personal knowledge
utilization. Experiments on both automatic and human evaluation verify the
superiority of our model over previous models.]]></summary>

in recent years, more and more attention is being paid to automated fake news
detection. Some fake news detection methods are already quite successful.
Nevertheless, there are still many vulnerabilities in the detection algorithms.
The reason for this is that fake news publishers can structure and formulate
their texts in such a way that a detection algorithm does not expose this text
as fake news. This paper shows that it is possible to automatically attack
state-of-the-art models that have been trained to detect Fake News, making
these vulnerable. For this purpose, corresponding models were first trained
based on a dataset. Then, using Text-Attack, an attempt was made to manipulate
the trained models in such a way that previously correctly identified fake news
was classified as true news. The results show that it is possible to
automatically bypass Fake News detection mechanisms, leading to implications
concerning existing policy initiatives.]]></summary>

considering the shortest dependency paths between keywords. Then, we propose
two encoding strategies to mode the information of whole syntactic trees to
obtain tree-based syntax. Finally, we combine both path-based and tree-based

that every benchmark makes a statement about what it perceives to be important,
we argue that this might lead to biased progress in the community. We discuss

considerably reduce the need of data for under-resourced languages.
Nevertheless, the superiority of language-specific models has already been
proven for languages having access to large amounts of data. In this work, we
focus on Catalan with the aim to explore to what extent a medium-sized
monolingual language model is competitive with state-of-the-art large
multilingual models. For this, we: (1) build a clean, high-quality textual
Catalan corpus (CaText), the largest to date (but only a fraction of the usual
size of the previous work in monolingual language models), (2) train a
Transformer-based language model for Catalan (BERTa), and (3) devise a thorough
evaluation in a diversity of settings, comprising a complete array of
downstream tasks, namely, Part of Speech Tagging, Named Entity Recognition and
Classification, Text Classification, Question Answering, and Semantic Textual
Similarity, with most of the corresponding datasets being created ex novo. The
result is a new benchmark, the Catalan Language Understanding Benchmark (CLUB),
which we publish as an open resource, together with the clean textual corpus,
the language model, and the cleaning pipeline. Using state-of-the-art
multilingual models and a monolingual model trained only on Wikipedia as

language learners. This study explores the effect of child-directed speech when
learning to extract semantic information from speech directly. We compare the
task performance of models trained on adult-directed speech (ADS) and
child-directed speech (CDS). We find indications that CDS helps in the initial
stages of learning, but eventually, models trained on ADS reach comparable task

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keyword spotting (KWS) is an important technique for speech applications,
which enables users to activate devices by speaking a keyword phrase. Although
a phoneme classifier can be used for KWS, exploiting a large amount of
transcribed data for automatic speech recognition (ASR), there is a mismatch
between the training criterion (phoneme recognition) and the target task (KWS).
Recently, multi-task learning has been applied to KWS to exploit both ASR and
KWS training data. In this approach, an output of an acoustic model is split
into two branches for the two tasks, one for phoneme transcription trained with
the ASR data and one for keyword classification trained with the KWS data. In
this paper, we introduce a cross attention decoder in the multi-task learning
framework. Unlike the conventional multi-task learning approach with the simple

create an adversarial attack for word-level adversarial training on BERT. The

pre-training techniques always suffer from low data quality and low

realized by learning a neural SQL executor over a synthetic corpus, which is
obtained by automatically synthesizing executable SQL queries. By pre-training
on the synthetic corpus, our approach TAPEX dramatically improves the
performance on downstream tasks, boosting existing language models by at most
19.5%. Meanwhile, TAPEX has remarkably high pre-training efficiency and yields
strong results when using a small pre-trained corpus. Experimental results
demonstrate that TAPEX outperforms previous table pre-training approaches by a
large margin, and our model achieves new state-of-the-art results on four
well-known datasets, including improving the WikiSQL denotation accuracy to

that every benchmark makes a statement about what it perceives to be important,
we argue that this might lead to biased progress in the community. We discuss

those facts are frozen in time at the point of model training. In contrast, we
propose an approach that learns to generate an internet search query based on

train and evaluate such models on a newly collected dataset of human-human
conversations whereby one of the speakers is given access to internet search
during knowledgedriven discussions in order to ground their responses. We find

linguistic behavior (queries made by shoppers, with items clicked and items not
clicked after the query) and catalog meta-data (images, text, pricing

solutions for two open problems: a recommendation task (where a model is shown
some events at the start of a session, and it is asked to predict future

important factor for modeling users in the design of recommendation systems.
Recent studies are starting to focus on predicting user intention (what users
want) beyond user preference (what users like). In this work, a user intention
model is proposed based on deep sequential topic analysis. The model predicts a
user's intention in terms of the topic of interest. The Hybrid Topic Model
(HTM) comprising Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Word2Vec is proposed to
derive the topic of interest of users and the history of preferences. HTM finds
the true topics of papers estimating word-topic distribution which includes
syntactic and semantic correlations among words. Next, to model user intention,
a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based sequential deep learning model is
proposed. This model takes into account temporal context, namely the time
difference between clicks of two consecutive papers seen by a user. Extensive
experiments with the real-world research paper dataset indicate that the
proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
Further, the proposed approach introduces a new road map to model a user
activity suitable for the design of a research paper recommendation system.]]></summary>

Our approach complements existing research; hence DoReMi allows harmonisation

using a music notation software and includes over 6400 printed sheet music
images with accompanying metadata useful in OMR research. Our dataset provides

challenging task. In particular, recovering information in over-exposed regions
is extremely difficult because details in such regions are almost completely

advantage of the feature extraction and mapping power of deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and uses a lightness prior to modulate the CNN to better
exploit observations in the surrounding areas of the over-exposed regions to
enhance the quality of HDR image reconstruction. Specifically, we introduce a
Hierarchical Synthesis Network (HiSN) for inferring a HDR image from a LDR
input and a Lightness Adpative Modulation Network (LAMN) to incorporate the the
lightness prior knowledge in the inferring process. The HiSN hierarchically
synthesizes the high-brightness component and the low-brightness component of
the HDR image whilst the LAMN uses a lightness adaptive mask that separates
detail-less saturated bright pixels from well-exposed lower light pixels to
enable HiSN to better infer the missing information, particularly in the
difficult over-exposed detail-less areas. We present experimental results to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the new technique based on quantitative
measures and visual comparisons. In addition, we present ablation studies of
HiSN and visualization of the activation maps inside LAMN to help gain a deeper
understanding of the internal working of the new iTM algorithm and explain why
it can achieve much improved performance over state-of-the-art algorithms.]]></summary>

many advantages compared to sparse retrieval. Existing dense retrievers
optimize representations of queries and documents with contrastive training and
map them to the embedding space. The embedding space is optimized by aligning
the matched query-document pairs and pushing the negative documents away from
the query. However, in such training paradigm, the queries are only optimized
to align to the documents and are coarsely positioned, leading to an
anisotropic query embedding space. In this paper, we analyze the embedding
space distributions and propose an effective training paradigm, Contrastive
Dual Learning for Approximate Nearest Neighbor (DANCE) to learn fine-grained
query representations for dense retrieval. DANCE incorporates an additional
dual training object of query retrieval, inspired by the classic information
retrieval training axiom, query likelihood. With contrastive learning, the dual
training object of DANCE learns more tailored representations for queries and
documents to keep the embedding space smooth and uniform, thriving on the
ranking performance of DANCE on the MS MARCO document retrieval task. Different
from ANCE that only optimized with the document retrieval task, DANCE
concentrates the query embeddings closer to document representations while
making the document distribution more discriminative. Such concentrated query
embedding distribution assigns more uniform negative sampling probabilities to
queries and helps to sufficiently optimize query representations in the query
retrieval task. Our codes are released at https://github.com/thunlp/DANCE.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The main challenges of Optical Music Recognition (OMR) come from the nature
of written music, its complexity and the difficulty of finding an appropriate
data representation. This paper provides a first look at DoReMi, an OMR dataset
that addresses these challenges, and a baseline object detection model to
assess its utility. Researchers often approach OMR following a set of small
stages, given that existing data often do not satisfy broader research. We
examine the possibility of changing this tendency by presenting more metadata.
Our approach complements existing research; hence DoReMi allows harmonisation
with two existing datasets, DeepScores and MUSCIMA++. DoReMi was generated
using a music notation software and includes over 6400 printed sheet music
images with accompanying metadata useful in OMR research. Our dataset provides
OMR metadata, MIDI, MEI, MusicXML and PNG files, each aiding a different stage
of OMR. We obtain 64% mean average precision (mAP) in object detection using
half of the data. Further work includes re-iterating through the creation
process to satisfy custom OMR models. While we do not assume to have solved the
main challenges in OMR, this dataset opens a new course of discussions that
would ultimately aid that goal.]]></summary>
