        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging approach for collaboratively training
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on mobile devices, without private user data
leaving the devices. Previous works have shown that non-Independent and
Identically Distributed (non-IID) user data harms the convergence speed of the
FL algorithms. Furthermore, most existing work on FL measures global-model
accuracy, but in many cases, such as user content-recommendation, improving
individual User model Accuracy (UA) is the real objective. To address these
issues, we propose a Multi-Task FL (MTFL) algorithm that introduces
non-federated Batch-Normalization (BN) layers into the federated DNN. MTFL
benefits UA and convergence speed by allowing users to train models
personalised to their own data. MTFL is compatible with popular iterative FL
optimisation algorithms such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), and we show
empirically that a distributed form of Adam optimisation (FedAvg-Adam) benefits
convergence speed even further when used as the optimisation strategy within
MTFL. Experiments using MNIST and CIFAR10 demonstrate that MTFL is able to
significantly reduce the number of rounds required to reach a target UA, by up
to $5\times$ when using existing FL optimisation strategies, and with a further
$3\times$ improvement when using FedAvg-Adam. We compare MTFL to competing
personalised FL algorithms, showing that it is able to achieve the best UA for
MNIST and CIFAR10 in all considered scenarios. Finally, we evaluate MTFL with
FedAvg-Adam on an edge-computing testbed, showing that its convergence and UA
benefits outweigh its overhead.]]></summary>

computational cost of direct numerical simulation by finite elements. To
address this issue, concurrent multiscale methods use the solution of cheaper
macroscale surrogates as boundary conditions to microscale sliding windows. The
microscale problems remain a numerically challenging operation both in terms of
implementation and cost. In this work we propose to replace the local
microscale solution by an Encoder-Decoder Convolutional Neural Network that
will generate fine-scale stress corrections to coarse predictions around
unresolved microscale features, without prior parametrisation of local
microscale problems. We deploy a Bayesian approach providing credible intervals
to evaluate the uncertainty of the predictions, which is then used to
investigate the merits of a selective learning framework. We will demonstrate
the capability of the approach to predict equivalent stress fields in porous

for the simulation of four turbulent-flow cases, i.e., zero-pressure-gradient

over a NACA4412 airfoil and the periodic hill. Our results show the excellent

property of convolutional networks, showing that small shifts in the input can
affect the output predictions substantially. In this paper, we analyze the
benefits of addressing lack of shift invariance in CNN-based sound event
classification. Specifically, we evaluate two pooling methods to improve shift
invariance in CNNs, based on low-pass filtering and adaptive sampling of
incoming feature maps. These methods are implemented via small architectural
modifications inserted into the pooling layers of CNNs. We evaluate the effect
of these architectural changes on the FSD50K dataset using models of different
capacity and in presence of strong regularization. We show that these
modifications consistently improve sound event classification in all cases
considered. We also demonstrate empirically that the proposed pooling methods
increase shift invariance in the network, making it more robust against
time/frequency shifts in input spectrograms. This is achieved by adding a
negligible amount of trainable parameters, which makes these methods an
appealing alternative to conventional pooling layers. The outcome is a new
state-of-the-art mAP of 0.541 on the FSD50K classification benchmark.]]></summary>

evolution theory algorithms. This project is an effort to apply new AI
techniques for solving the Light-up puzzle faster and more computationally
efficient. The algorithms explored for producing optimal solutions include hill
climbing, simulated annealing, feed-forward neural network (FNN), and
convolutional neural network (CNN). Two algorithms were developed for hill
climbing and simulated annealing using 2 actions (add and remove light bulb)
versus 3 actions(add, remove, or move light-bulb to a different cell). Both
hill climbing and simulated annealing algorithms showed a higher accuracy for
the case of 3 actions. The simulated annealing showed to significantly
outperform hill climbing, FNN, CNN, and an evolutionary theory algorithm
achieving 100% accuracy in 30 unique board configurations. Lastly, while FNN
and CNN algorithms showed low accuracies, computational times were
significantly faster compared to the remaining algorithms. The GitHub

is a powerful technique for discovering low-dimensional structure in
high-dimensional data. In this paper, we study Tucker decompositions and use
tools from randomized numerical linear algebra called ridge leverage scores to
accelerate the core tensor update step in the widely-used alternating least
squares (ALS) algorithm. Updating the core tensor, a severe bottleneck in ALS,
is a highly-structured ridge regression problem where the design matrix is a
Kronecker product of the factor matrices. We show how to use approximate ridge
leverage scores to construct a sketched instance for any ridge regression
problem such that the solution vector for the sketched problem is a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation to the original instance. Moreover, we show
that classical leverage scores suffice as an approximation, which then allows
us to exploit the Kronecker structure and update the core tensor in time that
depends predominantly on the rank and the sketching parameters (i.e., sublinear
in the size of the input tensor). We also give upper bounds for ridge leverage
scores as rows are removed from the design matrix (e.g., if the tensor has
missing entries), and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approximate ridge
regressioni algorithm for large, low-rank Tucker decompositions on both

usually treat protein-ligand complexes as topological graph data, thus the
biomolecular structural information is not fully utilized. The essential
long-range interactions among atoms are also neglected in GNN models. To this
end, we propose a structure-aware interactive graph neural network (SIGN) which
consists of two components: polar-inspired graph attention layers (PGAL) and
pairwise interactive pooling (PiPool). Specifically, PGAL iteratively performs
the node-edge aggregation process to update embeddings of nodes and edges while
preserving the distance and angle information among atoms. Then, PiPool is
adopted to gather interactive edges with a subsequent reconstruction loss to
reflect the global interactions. Exhaustive experimental study on two

databases is the heterogeneity of the data distribution (i.e., non-IID) among
the parties. There have been many FL algorithms to address the learning
effectiveness under non-IID data settings. However, there lacks an experimental
study on systematically understanding their advantages and disadvantages, as
previous studies have very rigid data partitioning strategies among parties,
which are hardly representative and thorough. In this paper, to help
researchers better understand and study the non-IID data setting in federated
learning, we propose comprehensive data partitioning strategies to cover the
typical non-IID data cases. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments to
evaluate state-of-the-art FL algorithms. We find that non-IID does bring
significant challenges in learning accuracy of FL algorithms, and none of the
existing state-of-the-art FL algorithms outperforms others in all cases. Our
experiments provide insights for future studies of addressing the challenges in
``data silos''.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metric learning especially deep metric learning has been widely developed for
large-scale image inputs data. However, in many real-world applications, we can
only have access to vectorized inputs data. Moreover, on one hand, well-labeled
data is usually limited due to the high annotation cost. On the other hand, the
real data is commonly streaming data, which requires to be processed online. In
these scenarios, the fashionable deep metric learning is not suitable anymore.
To this end, we reconsider the traditional shallow online metric learning and
newly develop an online progressive deep metric learning (ODML) framework to
construct a metric-algorithm-based deep network. Specifically, we take an
online metric learning algorithm as a metric-algorithm-based layer (i.e.,
metric layer), followed by a nonlinear layer, and then stack these layers in a
fashion similar to deep learning. Different from the shallow online metric
learning, which can only learn one metric space (feature transformation), the
proposed ODML is able to learn multiple hierarchical metric spaces.
Furthermore, in a progressively and nonlinearly learning way, ODML has a
stronger learning ability than traditional shallow online metric learning in
the case of limited available training data. To make the learning process more
explainable and theoretically guaranteed, we also provide theoretical analysis.
The proposed ODML enjoys several nice properties and can indeed learn a metric
progressively and performs better on the benchmark datasets. Extensive
experiments with different settings have been conducted to verify these
properties of the proposed ODML.]]></summary>

because of the limitation of installation height, severe perspective effect in
distance occurs, and it is almost impossible to detect vehicles in far distance

(Pflugfelder 2005). To overcome the limitation, a vehicle object is detected
through an object detection algorithm based on an inverse perspective transform

away from the CCTV. To verify this process, this paper creates each dataset

of the CCTV at the same time, and then compares performance of the deep
learning object detection models trained with the two datasets. As a result,
the model that trained the warped image was able to detect vehicle objects more

convolution blocks, and, hence, recursive sharing of parameters across these
blocks has been proposed to reduce the amount of parameters. However, naive
sharing of parameters poses many challenges such as limited representational
power and the vanishing/exploding gradients problem of recursively shared
parameters. In this paper, we present a recursive convolution block design and
training method, in which a recursively shareable part, or a filter basis, is
separated and learned while effectively avoiding the vanishing/exploding
gradients problem during training. We show that the unwieldy
vanishing/exploding gradients problem can be controlled by enforcing the
elements of the filter basis orthonormal, and empirically demonstrate that the
proposed orthogonality regularization improves the flow of gradients during
training. Experimental results on image classification and object detection
show that our approach, unlike previous parameter-sharing approaches, does not
trade performance to save parameters and consistently outperforms
overparameterized counterpart networks. This superior performance demonstrates
that the proposed recursive convolution block design and the orthogonality
regularization not only prevent performance degradation, but also consistently
improve the representation capability while a significant amount of parameters
are recursively shared.]]></summary>

computers. Limited research efforts have explored a higher level of
optimization by making the quantum circuit resilient to noise. We propose and
experimentally implement QuantumNAS, the first comprehensive framework for
noise-adaptive co-search of variational circuit and qubit mapping. Variational
quantum circuits are a promising approach for constructing quantum neural
networks for machine learning and variational ansatzes for quantum simulation.
However, finding the best variational circuit and its optimal parameters is
challenging in a high-dimensional Hilbert space. We propose to decouple the
parameter training and circuit search by introducing a novel gate-sharing
SuperCircuit. The SuperCircuit is trained by sampling and updating the
SubCircuits in it and provides an accurate estimation of SubCircuit performance
trained from scratch. Then we perform an evolutionary co-search of SubCircuit
and its qubit mapping. The SubCircuit performance is estimated with parameters
inherited from SuperCircuit and simulated with real device noise models.
Finally, we perform iterative gate pruning and finetuning to further remove the
redundant gates in a fine-grained manner.

Extensively evaluated with 12 QML and VQE benchmarks on 10 quantum computers,
QuantumNAS significantly outperforms noise-unaware search, human and random
baselines. For QML tasks, QuantumNAS is the first to demonstrate over 95%
2-class, 85% 4-class, and 32% 10-class classification accuracy on real quantum
computers. It also achieves the lowest eigenvalue for VQE tasks on H2, H2O,
LiH, CH4, BeH2 compared with UCCSD baselines. We also open-source QuantumEngine

Although supervised methods have achieved state-of-art performance, acquiring
expert annotation is laborious and mostly limited for two-dimensional datasets
with a small sample size. On the contrary, unsupervised methods rely on
handcrafted features to detect tube-like structures such as vessels. However,
those methods require complex pipelines involving several hyper-parameters and
design choices rendering the procedure sensitive, dataset-specific, and not
generalizable. We propose a self-supervised method with a limited number of
hyper-parameters that is generalizable across modalities. Our method uses
tube-like structure properties, such as connectivity, profile consistency, and
bifurcation, to introduce inductive bias into a learning algorithm. To model
those properties, we generate a vector field that we refer to as a flow. Our
experiments on various public datasets in 2D and 3D show that our method
performs better than unsupervised methods while learning useful transferable
features from unlabeled data. Unlike generic self-supervised methods, the
learned features learn vessel-relevant features that are transferable for
supervised approaches, which is essential when the number of annotated data is

efficiently processing these computational- and memory-intensive applications,
tensors of these over-parameterized models are compressed by leveraging
sparsity, size reduction, and quantization of tensors. Unstructured sparsity
and tensors with varying dimensions yield irregular computation, communication,
and memory access patterns; processing them on hardware accelerators in a
conventional manner does not inherently leverage acceleration opportunities.
This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the efficient execution of sparse
and irregular tensor computations of ML models on hardware accelerators. In
particular, it discusses enhancement modules in the architecture design and the
software support; categorizes different hardware designs and acceleration
techniques and analyzes them in terms of hardware and execution costs; analyzes
achievable accelerations for recent DNNs; highlights further opportunities in
terms of hardware/software/model co-design optimizations (inter/intra-module).
The takeaways from this paper include: understanding the key challenges in
accelerating sparse, irregular-shaped, and quantized tensors; understanding
enhancements in accelerator systems for supporting their efficient
computations; analyzing trade-offs in opting for a specific design choice for
encoding, storing, extracting, communicating, computing, and load-balancing the
non-zeros; understanding how structured sparsity can improve storage efficiency
and balance computations; understanding how to compile and map models with

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several works have demonstrated the use of variational autoencoders (VAEs)
for generating levels in the style of existing games and blending levels across
different games. Further, quality-diversity (QD) algorithms have also become
popular for generating varied game content by using evolution to explore a
search space while focusing on both variety and quality. To reap the benefits
of both these approaches, we present a level generation and game blending
approach that combines the use of VAEs and QD algorithms. Specifically, we
train VAEs on game levels and run the MAP-Elites QD algorithm using the learned
latent space of the VAE as the search space. The latent space captures the
properties of the games whose levels we want to generate and blend, while
MAP-Elites searches this latent space to find a diverse set of levels
optimizing a given objective such as playability. We test our method using
models for 5 different platformer games as well as a blended domain spanning 3
of these games. We refer to using MAP-Elites for blending as Blend-Elites. Our
results show that MAP-Elites in conjunction with VAEs enables the generation of
a diverse set of playable levels not just for each individual game but also for
the blended domain while illuminating game-specific regions of the blended
latent space.]]></summary>

downstream text corpus and fine-tuned on a downstream task becomes a de facto
training strategy for several natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
Recently, an adaptive pretraining method retraining the pretrained language
model with task-relevant data has shown significant performance improvements.
However, current adaptive pretraining methods suffer from underfitting on the
task distribution owing to a relatively small amount of data to re-pretrain the
LM. To completely use the concept of adaptive pretraining, we propose a
back-translated task-adaptive pretraining (BT-TAPT) method that increases the
amount of task-specific data for LM re-pretraining by augmenting the task data
using back-translation to generalize the LM to the target task domain. The
experimental results show that the proposed BT-TAPT yields improved
classification accuracy on both low- and high-resource data and better
robustness to noise than the conventional adaptive pretraining method.]]></summary>

of the presence of censoring, where the outcome measurement is only partially
known, due to, for example, loss to follow up. Such problems come up frequently
in medical applications, making survival analysis a key endeavor in
biostatistics and machine learning for healthcare, with Cox regression models
being amongst the most commonly employed models. We describe a new approach for
survival analysis regression models, based on learning mixtures of Cox
regressions to model individual survival distributions. We propose an
approximation to the Expectation Maximization algorithm for this model that
does hard assignments to mixture groups to make optimization efficient. In each
group assignment, we fit the hazard ratios within each group using deep neural
networks, and the baseline hazard for each mixture component
non-parametrically.

We perform experiments on multiple real world datasets, and look at the
mortality rates of patients across ethnicity and gender. We emphasize the
importance of calibration in healthcare settings and demonstrate that our
approach outperforms classical and modern survival analysis baselines, both in
terms of discriminative performance and calibration, with large gains in
performance on the minority demographics.]]></summary>

ensembling to federated learning (FL). Instead of aggregating localmodels to

Fed-ensemble can be readily utilized within established FL methods and does not
impose a computational overhead as it only requires one of the K models to be
sent to a client in each communication round. Theoretically, we show that
predictions on newdata from all K models belong to the same predictive
posterior distribution under a neural tangent kernel regime. This result in
turn sheds light onthe generalization advantages of model averaging. We also
illustrate thatFed-ensemble has an elegant Bayesian interpretation. Empirical
results show that our model has superior performance over several FL

has a memory cost that increases linearly with respect to the depth of the
network. A way to circumvent this issue is to use reversible architectures. In
this paper, we propose to change the forward rule of a ResNet by adding a
momentum term. The resulting networks, momentum residual neural networks
(Momentum ResNets), are invertible. Unlike previous invertible architectures,
they can be used as a drop-in replacement for any existing ResNet block. We
show that Momentum ResNets can be interpreted in the infinitesimal step size
regime as second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and exactly
characterize how adding momentum progressively increases the representation
capabilities of Momentum ResNets. Our analysis reveals that Momentum ResNets
can learn any linear mapping up to a multiplicative factor, while ResNets
cannot. In a learning to optimize setting, where convergence to a fixed point
is required, we show theoretically and empirically that our method succeeds
while existing invertible architectures fail. We show on CIFAR and ImageNet
that Momentum ResNets have the same accuracy as ResNets, while having a much
smaller memory footprint, and show that pre-trained Momentum ResNets are
promising for fine-tuning models.]]></summary>

$d$-dimensional (sub)Gaussian distributions with unknown covariance.
Informally, given $n \gtrsim d/\alpha^2$ samples from such a distribution with
mean $\mu$ and covariance $\Sigma$, our estimators output $\tilde\mu$ such that
$\| \tilde\mu - \mu \|_{\Sigma} \leq \alpha$, where $\| \cdot \|_{\Sigma}$ is
the Mahalanobis distance. All previous estimators with the same guarantee
either require strong a priori bounds on the covariance matrix or require
$\Omega(d^{3/2})$ samples.

Each of our estimators is based on a simple, general approach to designing
differentially private mechanisms, but with novel technical steps to make the
estimator private and sample-efficient. Our first estimator samples a point
with approximately maximum Tukey depth using the exponential mechanism, but
restricted to the set of points of large Tukey depth. Proving that this
mechanism is private requires a novel analysis. Our second estimator perturbs
the empirical mean of the data set with noise calibrated to the empirical
covariance, without releasing the covariance itself. Its sample complexity
guarantees hold more generally for subgaussian distributions, albeit with a
slightly worse dependence on the privacy parameter. For both estimators,
careful preprocessing of the data is required to satisfy differential privacy.]]></summary>

multiple instances. To alleviate labeling complexity, each sample is associated
with a set of bag-level labels leaving instances within the bag unlabeled. This
setting is more convenient and natural for representing complicated objects,
which have multiple semantic meanings. Compared to single instance labeling,
this approach allows for labeling larger datasets at an equivalent labeling
cost. However, for sufficiently large datasets, labeling all bags may become
prohibitively costly. Active learning uses an iterative labeling and retraining
approach aiming to provide reasonable classification performance using a small
number of labeled samples. To our knowledge, only a few works in the area of
active learning in the MIML setting are available. These approaches can provide
practical solutions to reduce labeling cost but their efficacy remains unclear.
In this paper, we propose a novel bag-class pair based approach for active
learning in the MIML setting. Due to the partial availability of bag-level
labels, we focus on the incomplete-label MIML setting for the proposed active
learning approach. Our approach is based on a discriminative graphical model
with efficient and exact inference. For the query process, we adapt active
learning criteria to the novel bag-class pair selection strategy. Additionally,
we introduce an online stochastic gradient descent algorithm to provide an
efficient model update after each query. Numerical experiments on benchmark

a multilevel representation of discrete data which directly enables data

represent kernel matrices, as they arise in kernel based learning or Gaussian
process regression, we end up with quasi-sparse matrices. By thresholding small
entries, these matrices are compressible to O(N log N) relevant entries, where
N is the number of data points. This feature allows for the use of fill-in
reducing reorderings to obtain a sparse factorization of the compressed
matrices. Besides the comprehensive introduction to samplets and their

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, a novel two-branch neural network model structure is proposed
for multimodal emotion recognition, which consists of a time synchronous branch
(TSB) and a time asynchronous branch (TAB). To capture correlations between
each word and its acoustic realisation, the TSB combines speech and text
modalities at each input window frame and then does pooling across time to form
a single embedding vector. The TAB, by contrast, provides cross-utterance
information by integrating sentence text embeddings from a number of context
utterances into another embedding vector. The final emotion classification uses
both the TSB and the TAB embeddings. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP
dataset demonstrate that the two-branch structure achieves state-of-the-art
results in 4-way classification with all common test setups. When using
automatic speech recognition (ASR) output instead of manually transcribed
reference text, it is shown that the cross-utterance information considerably
improves the robustness against ASR errors. Furthermore, by incorporating an
extra class for all the other emotions, the final 5-way classification system
with ASR hypotheses can be viewed as a prototype for more realistic emotion
recognition systems.]]></summary>

amounts of information about individual inputs. In extreme cases, complex
models appear to memorize entire input examples, including seemingly irrelevant
information (social security numbers from text, for example). In this paper, we
aim to understand whether this sort of memorization is necessary for accurate
learning. We describe natural prediction problems in which every sufficiently
accurate training algorithm must encode, in the prediction model, essentially
all the information about a large subset of its training examples. This remains
true even when the examples are high-dimensional and have entropy much higher
than the sample size, and even when most of that information is ultimately
irrelevant to the task at hand. Further, our results do not depend on the
training algorithm or the class of models used for learning.

Our problems are simple and fairly natural variants of the next-symbol
prediction and the cluster labeling tasks. These tasks can be seen as
abstractions of text- and image-related prediction problems. To establish our
results, we reduce from a family of one-way communication problems for which we
prove new information complexity lower bounds. Additionally, we present
synthetic-data experiments demonstrating successful attacks on logistic
regression and neural network classifiers.]]></summary>

retailers, as it provides crucial input for subsequent decision making like
ordering processes. In contrast to point estimates, such as the conditional
mean of the underlying probability distribution, or confidence intervals,
forecasting complete probability density functions allows to investigate the
impact on operational metrics, which are important to define the business
strategy, over the full range of the expected demand. Whereas metrics
evaluating point estimates are widely used, methods for assessing the accuracy
of predicted distributions are rare, and this work proposes new techniques for
both qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods. Using the supervised
machine learning method "Cyclic Boosting", complete individual probability
density functions can be predicted such that each prediction is fully
explainable. This is of particular importance for practitioners, as it allows
to avoid "black-box" models and understand the contributing factors for each
individual prediction. Another crucial aspect in terms of both explainability
and generalizability of demand forecasting methods is the limitation of the
influence of temporal confounding, which is prevalent in most state of the art

various shilling attack models and analyzed their adverse effects. Primitive
attacks are highly feasible but less effective due to simplistic handcrafted
rules, while upgraded attacks are more powerful but costly and difficult to
deploy because they require more knowledge from recommendations. In this paper,
we explore a novel shilling attack called Graph cOnvolution-based generative
shilling ATtack (GOAT) to balance the attacks' feasibility and effectiveness.
GOAT adopts the primitive attacks' paradigm that assigns items for fake users
by sampling and the upgraded attacks' paradigm that generates fake ratings by a
deep learning-based model. It deploys a generative adversarial network (GAN)
that learns the real rating distribution to generate fake ratings.
Additionally, the generator combines a tailored graph convolution structure
that leverages the correlations between co-rated items to smoothen the fake
ratings and enhance their authenticity. The extensive experiments on two public
datasets evaluate GOAT's performance from multiple perspectives. Our study of
the GOAT demonstrates technical feasibility for building a more powerful and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Achieving accurate and robust global situational awareness of a complex
time-evolving field from a limited number of sensors has been a longstanding
challenge. This reconstruction problem is especially difficult when sensors are
sparsely positioned in a seemingly random or unorganized manner, which is often
encountered in a range of scientific and engineering problems. Moreover, these
sensors can be in motion and can become online or offline over time. The key
leverage in addressing this scientific issue is the wealth of data accumulated
from the sensors. As a solution to this problem, we propose a data-driven
spatial field recovery technique founded on a structured grid-based
deep-learning approach for arbitrary positioned sensors of any numbers. It
should be noted that the na\"ive use of machine learning becomes prohibitively
expensive for global field reconstruction and is furthermore not adaptable to
an arbitrary number of sensors. In the present work, we consider the use of
Voronoi tessellation to obtain a structured-grid representation from sensor
locations enabling the computationally tractable use of convolutional neural
networks. One of the central features of the present method is its
compatibility with deep-learning based super-resolution reconstruction
techniques for structured sensor data that are established for image
processing. The proposed reconstruction technique is demonstrated for unsteady
wake flow, geophysical data, and three-dimensional turbulence. The current
framework is able to handle an arbitrary number of moving sensors, and thereby
overcomes a major limitation with existing reconstruction methods. The
presented technique opens a new pathway towards the practical use of neural
networks for real-time global field estimation.]]></summary>

"for good": they can be used to run counter to the existing power structures

how authors view their work's impact more generally. We find that most
adversarial ML researchers at NeurIPS hold two fundamental assumptions that
will make it difficult for them to consider socially beneficial uses of
attacks: (1) it is desirable to make systems robust, independent of context,
and (2) attackers of systems are normatively bad and defenders of systems are
normatively good. That is, despite their expressed and supposed neutrality,
most adversarial ML researchers believe that the goal of their work is to

convolutional neural network that efficiently learns customized band-pass

analyze the neural activity of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),
who experience characteristic differences in neural oscillatory activity. In
particular, we propose a novel SincNet-based neural network for detecting
emotions in ASD patients using EEG signals. The learned filters can be easily
inspected to detect which part of the EEG spectrum is used for predicting
emotions. We found that our system automatically learns the high-$\alpha$ (9-13
Hz) and $\beta$ (13-30 Hz) band suppression often present in individuals with
ASD. This result is consistent with recent neuroscience studies on emotion
recognition, which found an association between these band suppressions and the
behavioral deficits observed in individuals with ASD. The improved

and is crucial for developing promising dialogue systems. However, existing
metrics have two major limitations: (a) they are mostly trained in a simplified
two-level setting (coherent vs. incoherent), while humans give Likert-type
multi-level coherence scores, dubbed as "quantifiable"; (b) their predicted
coherence scores cannot align with the actual human rating standards due to the
absence of human guidance during training. To address these limitations, we
propose Quantifiable Dialogue Coherence Evaluation (QuantiDCE), a novel
framework aiming to train a quantifiable dialogue coherence metric that can
reflect the actual human rating standards. Specifically, QuantiDCE includes two
training stages, Multi-Level Ranking (MLR) pre-training and Knowledge
Distillation (KD) fine-tuning. During MLR pre-training, a new MLR loss is
proposed for enabling the model to learn the coarse judgement of coherence
degrees. Then, during KD fine-tuning, the pretrained model is further finetuned
to learn the actual human rating standards with only very few human-annotated
data. To advocate the generalizability even with limited fine-tuning data, a
novel KD regularization is introduced to retain the knowledge learned at the
pre-training stage. Experimental results show that the model trained by
QuantiDCE presents stronger correlations with human judgements than the other
state-of-the-art metrics.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated learning is a distributed learning technique where machine learning
models are trained on client devices in which the local training data resides.
The training is coordinated via a central server which is, typically,
controlled by the intended owner of the resulting model. By avoiding the need
to transport the training data to the central server, federated learning
improves privacy and efficiency. But it raises the risk of model theft by
clients because the resulting model is available on every client device. Even
if the application software used for local training may attempt to prevent
direct access to the model, a malicious client may bypass any such restrictions
by reverse engineering the application software. Watermarking is a well-known
deterrence method against model theft by providing the means for model owners
to demonstrate ownership of their models. Several recent deep neural network
(DNN) watermarking techniques use backdooring: training the models with
additional mislabeled data. Backdooring requires full access to the training
data and control of the training process. This is feasible when a single party
trains the model in a centralized manner, but not in a federated learning
setting where the training process and training data are distributed among
several client devices. In this paper, we present WAFFLE, the first approach to
watermark DNN models trained using federated learning. It introduces a
retraining step at the server after each aggregation of local models into the
global model. We show that WAFFLE efficiently embeds a resilient watermark into
models incurring only negligible degradation in test accuracy (-0.17%), and
does not require access to training data. We also introduce a novel technique
to generate the backdoor used as a watermark. It outperforms prior techniques,
imposing no communication, and low computational (+3.2%) overhead.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We propose an online multi-view depth prediction approach on posed video
streams, where the scene geometry information computed in the previous time
steps is propagated to the current time step in an efficient and geometrically
plausible way. The backbone of our approach is a real-time capable, lightweight
encoder-decoder that relies on cost volumes computed from pairs of images. We
extend it by placing a ConvLSTM cell at the bottleneck layer, which compresses
an arbitrary amount of past information in its states. The novelty lies in
propagating the hidden state of the cell by accounting for the viewpoint
changes between time steps. At a given time step, we warp the previous hidden
state into the current camera plane using the previous depth prediction. Our
extension brings only a small overhead of computation time and memory
consumption, while improving the depth predictions significantly. As a result,
we outperform the existing state-of-the-art multi-view stereo methods on most
of the evaluated metrics in hundreds of indoor scenes while maintaining a
real-time performance. Code available:

developer flexibility and productivity. Lack of static typing can cause
run-time exceptions and is a major factor for weak IDE support. To alleviate
these issues, PEP 484 introduced optional type annotations for Python. As
retrofitting types to existing codebases is error-prone and laborious,
learning-based approaches have been proposed to enable automatic type
annotations based on existing, partially annotated codebases. However, it is
still quite challenging for learning-based approaches to give a relevant
prediction in the first suggestion or the first few ones. In this paper, we
present Type4Py, a deep similarity learning-based hierarchical neural network
model that learns to discriminate between types of the same kind and dissimilar
types in a high-dimensional space, which results in clusters of types. Nearest
neighbor search suggests a list of likely types for arguments, variables, and
functions' return. The results of the quantitative and qualitative evaluation
indicate that Type4Py significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches at
the type prediction task. Considering the Top-1 prediction, Type4Py obtains a
Mean Reciprocal Rank of 72.5%, which is 10.87% and 16.45% higher than that of
Typilus and TypeWriter, respectively.]]></summary>

unprecedented realism. These faces, also known as "Deep Fakes", appear as
realistic photographs with very little pixel-level distortions. While some work
has enabled the training of models that lead to the generation of specific
properties of the subject, generating a facial image based on a natural
language description has not been fully explored. For security and criminal
identification, the ability to provide a GAN-based system that works like a
sketch artist would be incredibly useful. In this paper, we present a novel
approach to generate facial images from semantic text descriptions. The learned
model is provided with a text description and an outline of the type of face,
which the model uses to sketch the features. Our models are trained using an
Affine Combination Module (ACM) mechanism to combine the text embedding from
BERT and the GAN latent space using a self-attention matrix. This avoids the
loss of features due to inadequate "attention", which may happen if text
embedding and latent vector are simply concatenated. Our approach is capable of
generating images that are very accurately aligned to the exhaustive textual
descriptions of faces with many fine detail features of the face and helps in
generating better images. The proposed method is also capable of making
incremental changes to a previously generated image if it is provided with
additional textual descriptions or sentences.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Travel time estimation is one of the core tasks for the development of
intelligent transportation systems. Most previous works model the road segments
or intersections separately by learning their spatio-temporal characteristics
to estimate travel time. However, due to the continuous alternations of the
road segments and intersections in a path, the dynamic features are supposed to
be coupled and interactive. Therefore, modeling one of them limits further
improvement in accuracy of estimating travel time. To address the above
problems, a novel graph-based deep learning framework for travel time
estimation is proposed in this paper, namely Spatio-Temporal Dual Graph Neural
Networks (STDGNN). Specifically, we first establish the node-wise and edge-wise
graphs to respectively characterize the adjacency relations of intersections
and that of road segments. In order to extract the joint spatio-temporal
correlations of the intersections and road segments, we adopt the
spatio-temporal dual graph learning approach that incorporates multiple
spatial-temporal dual graph learning modules with multi-scale network
architectures for capturing multi-level spatial-temporal information from the
dual graph. Finally, we employ the multi-task learning approach to estimate the
travel time of a given whole route, each road segment and intersection
simultaneously. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed model
on three real-world trajectory datasets, and the experimental results show that
STDGNN significantly outperforms several state-of-art baselines.]]></summary>

advantages for 6G networks, security concerns on Artificial Intelligent (AI)
models is typically ignored by the scientific community so far. However,
security is also a vital part of the AI algorithms, this is because the AI
model itself can be poisoned by attackers. This paper proposes a mitigation
method for adversarial attacks against proposed 6G machine learning models for
the millimeter-wave (mmWave) beam prediction using adversarial learning. The
main idea behind adversarial attacks against machine learning models is to
produce faulty results by manipulating trained deep learning models for 6G
applications for mmWave beam prediction. We also present the adversarial
learning mitigation method's performance for 6G security in mmWave beam
prediction application with fast gradient sign method attack. The mean square
errors (MSE) of the defended model under attack are very close to the
undefended model without attack.]]></summary>

perfectly if all information about its input other than class membership has
been discarded prior to the output layer. Surprisingly, past research has
discovered that some extraneous visual detail remains in the logit vector. This
finding is based on inversion techniques that map deep embeddings back to
images. We explore this phenomenon further using a novel synthesis of methods,
yielding a feedforward inversion model that produces remarkably high fidelity
reconstructions, qualitatively superior to those of past efforts. When applied
to an adversarially robust classifier model, the reconstructions contain
sufficient local detail and global structure that they might be confused with
the original image in a quick glance, and the object category can clearly be
gleaned from the reconstruction. Our approach is based on BigGAN (Brock, 2019),
with conditioning on logits instead of one-hot class labels. We use our
reconstruction model as a tool for exploring the nature of representations,
including: the influence of model architecture and training objectives
(specifically robust losses), the forms of invariance that networks achieve,
representational differences between correctly and incorrectly classified
images, and the effects of manipulating logits and images. We believe that our
method can inspire future investigations into the nature of information flow in
a neural net and can provide diagnostics for improving discriminative models.]]></summary>

and Apple, need to estimate the risk that a user was infected during a
particular exposure, in order to decide whether to notify the user to take
precautions, such as entering into quarantine, or requesting a test. Such risk
score models contain numerous parameters that must be set by the public health
authority. In this paper, we show how to automatically learn these parameters
from data.

Our method needs access to exposure and outcome data. Although this data is
already being collected (in an aggregated, privacy-preserving way) by several
health authorities, in this paper we limit ourselves to simulated data, so that
we can systematically study the different factors that affect the feasibility
of the approach. In particular, we show that the parameters become harder to
estimate when there is more missing data (e.g., due to infections which were
not recorded by the app), and when there is model misspecification.
Nevertheless, the learning approach outperforms a strong manually designed
baseline. Furthermore, the learning approach can adapt even when the risk
factors of the disease change, e.g., due to the evolution of new variants, or
the adoption of vaccines.]]></summary>

to create an amazing digital customer experience and indeed deploy in
production and solve real-world problems is something innovative and
disruptive. We introduce a new Portuguese financial domain language
representation model called BERTa\'u. BERTa\'u is an uncased BERT-base trained
from scratch with data from the Ita\'u virtual assistant chatbot solution. Our
novel contribution is that BERTa\'u pretrained language model requires less
data, reached state-of-the-art performance in three NLP tasks, and generates a
smaller and lighter model that makes the deployment feasible. We developed
three tasks to validate our model: information retrieval with Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ) from Ita\'u bank, sentiment analysis from our virtual assistant
data, and a NER solution. All proposed tasks are real-world solutions in
production on our environment and the usage of a specialist model proved to be
effective when compared to Google BERT multilingual and the DPRQuestionEncoder
from Facebook, available at Hugging Face. The BERTa\'u improves the performance
in 22% of FAQ Retrieval MRR metric, 2.1% in Sentiment Analysis F1 score, 4.4%
in NER F1 score and can also represent the same sequence in up to 66% fewer

in computer vision. With the heterogeneous functional layers that cannot be
pro-cessed by the accelerators proposed for convolution layers only, modern
end-to-end CNN acceleration so-lutions either transform the diverse computation
into matrix/vector arithmetic, which loses data reuse op-portunities in
convolution, or introduce dedicated functional unit to each kind of layer,
which results in underutilization and high update expense. To enhance the
whole-life cost efficiency, we need an acceleration solution that is efficient
in processing CNN layers and has the generality to apply to all kinds of
existing and emerging layers. To this end, we pro-pose GCONV Chain, a method to
convert the entire CNN computation into a chain of standard general
convolutions (GCONV) that can be efficiently pro-cessed by the existing CNN
accelerators. This paper comprehensively analyzes the GCONV Chain model and
proposes a full-stack implementation to support GCONV Chain. On one hand, the
results on seven var-ious CNNs demonstrate that GCONV Chain improves the
performance and energy efficiency of existing CNN accelerators by an average of
3.4x and 3.2x re-spectively. On the other hand, we show that GCONV Chain
provides low whole-life costs for CNN accelera-tion, including both developer

costing over 1 billion USD on average per drug and taking 10-15 years. To
reduce the high levels of attrition throughout the process, there has been a
growing interest in applying machine learning methodologies to various stages
of drug discovery process in the recent decade, including at the earliest stage
- identification of druggable disease genes. In this paper, we have developed a
new tensor factorisation model to predict potential drug targets (i.e.,genes or
proteins) for diseases. We created a three dimensional tensor which consists of
1,048 targets, 860 diseases and 230,011 evidence attributes and clinical
outcomes connecting them, using data extracted from the Open Targets and
PharmaProjects databases. We enriched the data with gene representations
learned from a drug discovery-oriented knowledge graph and applied our proposed
method to predict the clinical outcomes for unseen target and dis-ease pairs.
We designed three evaluation strategies to measure the prediction performance
and benchmarked several commonly used machine learning classifiers together
with matrix and tensor factorisation methods. The result shows that
incorporating knowledge graph embeddings significantly improves the prediction
accuracy and that training tensor factorisation alongside a dense neural
network outperforms other methods. In summary, our framework combines two
actively studied machine learning approaches to disease target identification,
tensor factorisation and knowledge graph representation learning, which could
be a promising avenue for further exploration in data-driven drug discovery.]]></summary>

allowed to directly interact with their environment to collect millions of
observations. This makes it hard to transfer their success to industrial
control problems, where simulations are often very costly or do not exist, and
exploring in the real environment can potentially lead to catastrophic events.
Recently developed, model-free, offline RL algorithms, can learn from a single
dataset (containing limited exploration) by mitigating extrapolation error in
value functions. However, the robustness of the training process is still
comparatively low, a problem known from methods using value functions. To
improve robustness and stability of the learning process, we use dynamics
models to assess policy performance instead of value functions, resulting in
MOOSE (MOdel-based Offline policy Search with Ensembles), an algorithm which
ensures low model bias by keeping the policy within the support of the data. We
compare MOOSE with state-of-the-art model-free, offline RL algorithms { BRAC,}
BEAR and BCQ on the Industrial Benchmark and MuJoCo continuous control tasks in

frequency band for both TE and TM polarized waves. To automatically generate
metasurfaces in a wide range of working frequencies from 4 to 45 GHz, we
deliberately design an 8 ring-shaped pattern in such a way that the unit-cells
generated in the dataset can produce single or multiple notches in the desired
working frequency band. Compared to the general approach, whereby the final
metasurface structure may be formed by any randomly distributed "0" and "1", we
propose here a restricted output structure. By restricting the output, the
number of calculations will be reduced and the learning speed will be
increased. Moreover, we have shown that the accuracy of the network reaches
91\%. Obtaining the final unit cell directly without any time-consuming
optimization algorithms for both TE and TM polarized waves, and high average
accuracy, promises an effective strategy for the metasurface design; thus, the

unique representation of real-world objects and their interactions. As graphs
are getting bigger and bigger nowadays, it is common to see their subgraphs
separately collected and stored in multiple local systems. Therefore, it is
natural to consider the subgraph federated learning setting, where each local
system holding a small subgraph that may be biased from the distribution of the
whole graph. Hence, the subgraph federated learning aims to collaboratively
train a powerful and generalizable graph mining model without directly sharing
their graph data. In this work, towards the novel yet realistic setting of
subgraph federated learning, we propose two major techniques: (1) FedSage,
which trains a GraphSage model based on FedAvg to integrate node features, link
structures, and task labels on multiple local subgraphs; (2) FedSage+, which
trains a missing neighbor generator along FedSage to deal with missing links
across local subgraphs. Empirical results on four real-world graph datasets
with synthesized subgraph federated learning settings demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed techniques. At the same time,
consistent theoretical implications are made towards their generalization

undertake a comparative analysis of differences and similarities between
classical and quantum fair machine learning algorithms, specifying how the
unique features of quantum computation alter measures, metrics and remediation
strategies when quantum algorithms are subject to fairness constraints. We
present the first results in quantum fair machine learning by demonstrating the
use of Grover's search algorithm to satisfy statistical parity constraints
imposed on quantum algorithms. We provide lower-bounds on iterations needed to
achieve such statistical parity within $\epsilon$-tolerance. We extend
canonical Lipschitz-conditioned individual fairness criteria to the quantum
setting using quantum metrics. We examine the consequences for typical measures
of fairness in machine learning context when quantum information processing and
quantum data are involved. Finally, we propose open questions and research
programmes for this new field of interest to researchers in computer science,

involving cognitive radars. We first discuss inverse tracking of the radar to
estimate the adversary's estimate of us based on the radar's actions and
calibrate the radar's sensing accuracy. Second, using revealed preference from
microeconomics, we formulate a non-parametric test to identify if the cognitive
radar is a constrained utility maximizer with signal processing constraints. We
consider two radar functionalities, namely, beam allocation and waveform
design, with respect to which the cognitive radar is assumed to maximize its
utility and construct a set-valued estimator for the radar's utility function.
Finally, we discuss how to engineer interference at the physical layer level to
confuse the radar which forces it to change its transmit waveform. The levels
of abstraction range from smart interference design based on Wiener filters (at
the pulse/waveform level), inverse Kalman filters at the tracking level and
revealed preferences for identifying utility maximization at the systems level.]]></summary>

same task distribution as the training tasks. The mechanism leading to fast
adaptation is the conditioning of a downstream predictive model on the inferred
representation of the task's underlying data generative process, or
\emph{function}. This \emph{meta-representation}, which is computed from a few
observed examples of the underlying function, is learned jointly with the
predictive model. In this work, we study the implications of this joint
training on the transferability of the meta-representations. Our goal is to
learn meta-representations that are robust to noise in the data and facilitate
solving a wide range of downstream tasks that share the same underlying
functions. To this end, we propose a decoupled encoder-decoder approach to
supervised meta-learning, where the encoder is trained with a contrastive
objective to find a good representation of the underlying function. In
particular, our training scheme is driven by the self-supervision signal
indicating whether two sets of examples stem from the same function. Our
experiments on a number of synthetic and real-world datasets show that the
representations we obtain outperform strong baselines in terms of downstream
performance and noise robustness, even when these baselines are trained in an
end-to-end manner.]]></summary>

for deployment on particular hardware? The commonly used hardware-aware network
compression techniques address this question with pruning, kernel fusion,
quantization and lowering precision. However, these approaches do not change
the underlying network operations. In this paper, we propose hardware-aware
network transformation (HANT), which accelerates a network by replacing
inefficient operations with more efficient alternatives using a neural
architecture search like approach. HANT tackles the problem in two phase: In
the first phase, a large number of alternative operations per every layer of
the teacher model is trained using layer-wise feature map distillation. In the
second phase, the combinatorial selection of efficient operations is relaxed to
an integer optimization problem that can be solved in a few seconds. We extend
HANT with kernel fusion and quantization to improve throughput even further.
Our experimental results on accelerating the EfficientNet family show that HANT
can accelerate them by up to 3.6x with <0.4% drop in the top-1 accuracy on the
ImageNet dataset. When comparing the same latency level, HANT can accelerate
EfficientNet-B4 to the same latency as EfficientNet-B1 while having 3% higher
accuracy. We examine a large pool of operations, up to 197 per layer, and we
provide insights into the selected operations and final architectures.]]></summary>

beneficial for secondary uses such as funding, insurance claim processing and
research. The current scenario of assigning codes is a manual process which is
very expensive, time-consuming and error prone. In recent years, many
researchers have studied the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP), related
Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods and techniques to resolve
the problem of manual coding of clinical narratives and to assist human coders
to assign clinical codes more accurately and efficiently. This systematic
literature review provides a comprehensive overview of automated clinical
coding systems that utilises appropriate NLP, ML and DL methods and techniques
to assign ICD codes to discharge summaries. We have followed the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses(PRISMA) guidelines and
conducted a comprehensive search of publications from January, 2010 to December
2020 in four academic databases- PubMed, ScienceDirect, Association for
Computing Machinery(ACM) Digital Library, and the Association for Computational
Linguistics(ACL) Anthology. We reviewed 7,556 publications; 38 met the
inclusion criteria. This review identified: datasets having discharge
summaries; NLP techniques along with some other data extraction processes,
different feature extraction and embedding techniques. To measure the
performance of classification methods, different evaluation metrics are used.
Lastly, future research directions are provided to scholars who are interested
in automated ICD code assignment. Efforts are still required to improve ICD
code prediction accuracy, availability of large-scale de-identified clinical
corpora with the latest version of the classification system. This can be a
platform to guide and share knowledge with the less experienced coders and
researchers.]]></summary>

of neural networks with formal quantification of uncertainty associated with
the predictive output in the Bayesian framework. However, it remains unclear
how to endow the parameters of the network with a prior distribution that is
meaningful when lifted into the output space of the network. A possible
solution is proposed that enables the user to posit an appropriate Gaussian
process covariance function for the task at hand. Our approach constructs a
prior distribution for the parameters of the network, called a ridgelet prior,
that approximates the posited Gaussian process in the output space of the
network. In contrast to existing work on the connection between neural networks
and Gaussian processes, our analysis is non-asymptotic, with finite sample-size
error bounds provided. This establishes the universality property that a
Bayesian neural network can approximate any Gaussian process whose covariance
function is sufficiently regular. Our experimental assessment is limited to a
proof-of-concept, where we demonstrate that the ridgelet prior can out-perform
an unstructured prior on regression problems for which a suitable Gaussian
process prior can be provided.]]></summary>

built upon programmable, virtualized, and disaggregated architectures. The
separation of control functions from the hardware fabric and the introduction
of standardized control interfaces will enable the definition of custom
closed-control loops, which will ultimately enable embedded intelligence and
real-time analytics, thus effectively realizing the vision of autonomous and
self-optimizing networks. This article explores the disaggregated network
architecture proposed by the O-RAN Alliance as a key enabler of NextG networks.
Within this architectural context, we discuss the potential, the challenges,
and the limitations of data-driven optimization approaches to network control
over different timescales. We also present the first large-scale integration of
O-RAN-compliant software components with an open-source full-stack softwarized
cellular network. Experiments conducted on Colosseum, the world's largest
wireless network emulator, demonstrate closed-loop integration of real-time
analytics and control through deep reinforcement learning agents. We also show
the feasibility of Radio Access Network (RAN) control through xApps running on

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Transparency is a fundamental requirement for decision making systems when
these should be deployed in the real world. It is usually achieved by providing
explanations of the system's behavior. A prominent and intuitive type of
explanations are counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations
explain a behavior to the user by proposing actions -- as changes to the input
-- that would cause a different (specified) behavior of the system. However,
such explanation methods can be unstable with respect to small changes to the
input -- i.e. even a small change in the input can lead to huge or arbitrary
changes in the output and of the explanation. This could be problematic for
counterfactual explanations, as two similar individuals might get very
different explanations. Even worse, if the recommended actions differ
considerably in their complexity, one would consider such unstable
(counterfactual) explanations as individually unfair.

In this work, we formally and empirically study the robustness of
counterfactual explanations in general, as well as under different models and
different kinds of perturbations. Furthermore, we propose that plausible
counterfactual explanations can be used instead of closest counterfactual
explanations to improve the robustness and consequently the individual fairness
of counterfactual explanations.]]></summary>

learner first receives a dataset $S$ drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution,
and outputs a model $\widehat{w}$ that performs well on unseen samples from the
same distribution. However, at some point in the future, any training datapoint
$z \in S$ can request to be unlearned, thus prompting the learner to modify its
output model while still ensuring the same accuracy guarantees. We initiate a
rigorous study of generalization in machine unlearning, where the goal is to
perform well on previously unseen datapoints. Our focus is on both
computational and storage complexity.

For the setting of convex losses, we provide an unlearning algorithm that can
unlearn up to $O(n/d^{1/4})$ samples, where $d$ is the problem dimension. In
comparison, in general, differentially private learning (which implies
unlearning) only guarantees deletion of $O(n/d^{1/2})$ samples. This
demonstrates a novel separation between differential privacy and machine
unlearning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detecting abrupt changes in temporal behavior patterns is of interest in many
industrial and security applications. Abrupt changes are often local and
observable primarily through a well-aligned sensing action (e.g., a camera with
a narrow field-of-view). Due to resource constraints, continuous monitoring of
all of the sensors is impractical. We propose the bandit quickest changepoint
detection framework as a means of balancing sensing cost with detection delay.
In this framework, sensing actions (or sensors) are sequentially chosen, and
only measurements corresponding to chosen actions are observed. We derive an
information-theoretic lower bound on the detection delay for a general class of
finitely parameterized probability distributions. We then propose a
computationally efficient online sensing scheme, which seamlessly balances the
need for exploration of different sensing options with exploitation of querying
informative actions. We derive expected delay bounds for the proposed scheme
and show that these bounds match our information-theoretic lower bounds at low
false alarm rates, establishing optimality of the proposed method. We then
perform a number of experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrating
the efficacy of our proposed method.]]></summary>

by two important parts: the data and the algorithm. As they are a fundamental
part of the problem, both must be considered when evaluating a model's
performance against a benchmark. The best classifiers need robust benchmarks to
be properly evaluated. For this, gold standard benchmarks such as OpenML-CC18
are used. However, data complexity is commonly not considered along with the
model during a performance evaluation. Recent studies employ Item Response
Theory (IRT) as a new approach to evaluating datasets and algorithms, capable
of evaluating both simultaneously. This work presents a new evaluation
methodology based on IRT and Glicko-2, jointly with the decodIRT tool developed
to guide the estimation of IRT in ML. It explores the IRT as a tool to evaluate
the OpenML-CC18 benchmark for its algorithmic evaluation capability and checks
if there is a subset of datasets more efficient than the original benchmark.
Several classifiers, from classics to ensemble, are also evaluated using the
IRT models. The Glicko-2 rating system was applied together with IRT to
summarize the innate ability and classifiers performance. It was noted that not
all OpenML-CC18 datasets are really useful for evaluating algorithms, where
only 10% were rated as being really difficult. Furthermore, it was verified the
existence of a more efficient subset containing only 50% of the original size.
While Randon Forest was singled out as the algorithm with the best innate
ability.]]></summary>

English-centric directions, while the non-English directions still lag behind.
In this work, we aim to build a many-to-many translation system with an
emphasis on the quality of non-English language directions. Our intuition is
based on the hypothesis that a universal cross-language representation leads to
better multilingual translation performance. To this end, we propose mRASP2, a
training method to obtain a single unified multilingual translation model.
mRASP2 is empowered by two techniques: a) a contrastive learning scheme to
close the gap among representations of different languages, and b) data
augmentation on both multiple parallel and monolingual data to further align
token representations. For English-centric directions, mRASP2 outperforms
existing best unified model and achieves competitive or even better performance
than the pre-trained and fine-tuned model mBART on tens of WMT's translation
directions. For non-English directions, mRASP2 achieves an improvement of
average 10+ BLEU compared with the multilingual Transformer baseline. Code,

estimating the maximum likelihood of mixture models or incomplete data
problems. A major challenge facing this popular technique is how to effectively
preserve the privacy of sensitive data. Previous research on this problem has
already lead to the discovery of some Differentially Private (DP) algorithms
for (Gradient) EM. However, unlike in the non-private case, existing techniques
are not yet able to provide finite sample statistical guarantees. To address
this issue, we propose in this paper the first DP version of (Gradient) EM
algorithm with statistical guarantees. Moreover, we apply our general framework
to three canonical models: Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Mixture of Regressions
Model (MRM) and Linear Regression with Missing Covariates (RMC). Specifically,
for GMM in the DP model, our estimation error is near optimal in some cases.
For the other two models, we provide the first finite sample statistical

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The surrogate model-based uncertainty quantification method has drawn a lot
of attention in recent years. Both the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and the
deep learning (DL) are powerful methods for building a surrogate model.
However, the PCE needs to increase the expansion order to improve the accuracy
of the surrogate model, which causes more labeled data to solve the expansion
coefficients, and the DL also needs a lot of labeled data to train the neural
network model. This paper proposes a deep arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion
(Deep aPCE) method to improve the balance between surrogate model accuracy and
training data cost. On the one hand, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) model is
used to solve the adaptive expansion coefficients of arbitrary polynomial chaos
expansion, which can improve the Deep aPCE model accuracy with lower expansion
order. On the other hand, the adaptive arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion's
properties are used to construct the MLP training cost function based on only a
small amount of labeled data and a large scale of non-labeled data, which can
significantly reduce the training data cost. Four numerical examples and an
actual engineering problem are used to verify the effectiveness of the Deep
aPCE method.]]></summary>

promising direction is continuous optimization for score-based methods, which
efficiently learn the causal graph in a data-driven manner. However, to date,
those methods require constrained optimization to enforce acyclicity or lack
convergence guarantees. In this paper, we present ENCO, an efficient structure
learning method for directed, acyclic causal graphs leveraging observational
and interventional data. ENCO formulates the graph search as an optimization of
independent edge likelihoods, with the edge orientation being modeled as a
separate parameter. Consequently, we can provide convergence guarantees of ENCO
under mild conditions without constraining the score function with respect to
acyclicity. In experiments, we show that ENCO can efficiently recover graphs
with hundreds of nodes, an order of magnitude larger than what was previously

(IEEE Trans.~Inform.~Theory, 1968) to learn a tree-structured graphical model
of a distribution. For a distribution $P$ on $\Sigma^n$ and a tree $T$ on $n$
nodes, we say $T$ is an $\varepsilon$-approximate tree for $P$ if there is a
$T$-structured distribution $Q$ such that $D(P\;||\;Q)$ is at most
$\varepsilon$ more than the best possible tree-structured distribution for $P$.
We show that if $P$ itself is tree-structured, then the Chow-Liu algorithm with
the plug-in estimator for mutual information with $\widetilde{O}(|\Sigma|^3
n\varepsilon^{-1})$ i.i.d.~samples outputs an $\varepsilon$-approximate tree
for $P$ with constant probability. In contrast, for a general $P$ (which may
not be tree-structured), $\Omega(n^2\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples are necessary to
find an $\varepsilon$-approximate tree. Our upper bound is based on a new
conditional independence tester that addresses an open problem posed by
Canonne, Diakonikolas, Kane, and Stewart~(STOC, 2018): we prove that for three
random variables $X,Y,Z$ each over $\Sigma$, testing if $I(X; Y \mid Z)$ is $0$
or $\geq \varepsilon$ is possible with $\widetilde{O}(|\Sigma|^3/\varepsilon)$
samples. Finally, we show that for a specific tree $T$, with $\widetilde{O}
(|\Sigma|^2n\varepsilon^{-1})$ samples from a distribution $P$ over $\Sigma^n$,
one can efficiently learn the closest $T$-structured distribution in KL
divergence by applying the add-1 estimator at each node.]]></summary>

must be followed to develop it, such as data mining that will be responsible
for filtering and then use only the relevant data for market basket analysis.
After filtering the information, the data must be prepared. After data
preparation, we prepared the Python programming environment to adapt it to the
sample data, then proceed to train the SOM with its parameters set after test
results. Result: the result of the SOM obtains the relationship between the
products that were most purchased by positioning them topologically close, to
form promotions, packs and bundles for the retail manager to take into

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep neural networks (DNN) have an impressive ability to invert very complex
models, i.e. to learn the generative parameters from a model's output. Once
trained, the forward pass of a DNN is often much faster than traditional,
optimization-based methods used to solve inverse problems. This is however done
at the cost of lower interpretability, a fundamental limitation in most medical
applications. We propose an approach for solving general inverse problems which
combines the efficiency of DNN and the interpretability of traditional
analytical methods. The measurements are first projected onto a dense
dictionary of model-based responses. The resulting sparse representation is
then fed to a DNN with an architecture driven by the problem's physics for fast
parameter learning. Our method can handle generative forward models that are
costly to evaluate and exhibits similar performance in accuracy and computation
time as a fully-learned DNN, while maintaining high interpretability and being
easier to train. Concrete results are shown on an example of model-based brain
parameter estimation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).]]></summary>

neural networks with respect to the squared loss, where labels are generated by
a target network. We make use of the rich symmetry structure to develop a novel
set of tools for studying families of spurious minima. In contrast to existing
approaches which operate in limiting regimes, our technique directly addresses
the nonconvex loss landscape for a finite number of inputs $d$ and neurons $k$,
and provides analytic, rather than heuristic, information. In particular, we
derive analytic estimates for the loss at different minima, and prove that
modulo $O(d^{-1/2})$-terms the Hessian spectrum concentrates near small
positive constants, with the exception of $\Theta(d)$ eigenvalues which grow
linearly with~$d$. We further show that the Hessian spectrum at global and
spurious minima coincide to $O(d^{-1/2})$-order, thus challenging our ability
to argue about statistical generalization through local curvature. Lastly, our
technique provides the exact \emph{fractional} dimensionality at which families
of critical points turn from saddles into spurious minima. This makes possible
the study of the creation and the annihilation of spurious minima using
powerful tools from equivariant bifurcation theory.]]></summary>

loss function (also known as Dice loss) due to its robustness in tasks where
the number of negative samples significantly exceeds that of positive samples,

detection. Conventional training of polyphonic sound event detection systems
with binary cross-entropy loss often results in suboptimal detection
performance as the training is often overwhelmed by updates from negative
samples. In this paper, we investigated the effect of the Dice loss, intra- and
inter-modal transfer learning, data augmentation, and recording formats, on the
performance of polyphonic sound event detection systems with multichannel
inputs. Our analysis showed that polyphonic sound event detection systems
trained with Dice loss consistently outperformed those trained with
cross-entropy loss across different training settings and recording formats in
terms of F1 score and error rate. We achieved further performance gains via the
use of transfer learning and an appropriate combination of different data

latent space of an autoencoder (AE). Even though this produces convincing
results, it has two major shortcomings. As the GAN is limited to reproduce the
dataset the AE was trained on, we cannot reuse a trained AE for novel data.
Furthermore, it is difficult to add spatial supervision into the generation
process, as the AE only gives us a global representation. To remedy these
issues, we propose to train the GAN on grids (i.e. each cell covers a part of a
shape). In this representation each cell is equipped with a latent vector
provided by an AE. This localized representation enables more expressiveness
(since the cell-based latent vectors can be combined in novel ways) as well as
spatial control of the generation process (e.g. via bounding boxes). Our method
outperforms the current state of the art on all established evaluation
measures, proposed for quantitatively evaluating the generative capabilities of
GANs. We show limitations of these measures and propose the adaptation of a
robust criterion from statistical analysis as an alternative.]]></summary>

forecast the pandemic course by utilizing a hybrid deep learning architecture

due to COVID-19, edges represent the human mobility trend and temporal edges
correspond to node attributes across time. The second approach is based on a
statistical technique for COVID-19 mortality prediction in the United States
that uses the SARIMA model and eXogenous variables. We evaluate these
techniques on both state and national levels COVID-19 data in the United States
and claim that the SARIMA and MCP models generated forecast values by the
eXogenous variables can enrich the underlying model to capture complexity in
respectively national and state levels data. We demonstrate significant
enhancement in the forecasting accuracy for a COVID-19 dataset, with a maximum
improvement in forecasting accuracy by 64.58% and 59.18% (on average) over the
GCN-LSTM model in the national level data, and 58.79% and 52.40% (on average)

recent times, primarily for events related to politics (2016 US Presidential

methods have been proposed for detecting Fake News. The approaches span from
exploiting techniques related to network analysis, Natural Language Processing

variety of these encodings provides a complementary advantage to our detector.
We evaluate our framework using two publicly available datasets containing
articles from domains such as politics, business, technology, and healthcare.
As part of dataset pre-processing, we also remove the bias, such as the source
of the articles, which could impact the performance of the models. DEAP-FAKED
obtains an F1-score of 88% and 78% for the two datasets, which is an
improvement of 21%, and 3% respectively, which shows the effectiveness of the

data is unstructured, making it hard to understand and difficult to interpret.
Information Extraction (IE) methods extract structured information from
unstructured data. One of the challenging IE tasks is Event Extraction (EE)
which seeks to derive information about specific incidents and their actors
from the text. EE is useful in many domains such as building a knowledge base,
information retrieval, summarization and online monitoring systems. In the past
decades, some event ontologies like ACE, CAMEO and ICEWS were developed to
define event forms, actors and dimensions of events observed in the text. These
event ontologies still have some shortcomings such as covering only a few
topics like political events, having inflexible structure in defining argument
roles, lack of analytical dimensions, and complexity in choosing event
sub-types. To address these concerns, we propose an event ontology, namely
COfEE, that incorporates both expert domain knowledge, previous ontologies and
a data-driven approach for identifying events from text. COfEE consists of two
hierarchy levels (event types and event sub-types) that include new categories
relating to environmental issues, cyberspace, criminal activity and natural
disasters which need to be monitored instantly. Also, dynamic roles according
to each event sub-type are defined to capture various dimensions of events. In
a follow-up experiment, the proposed ontology is evaluated on Wikipedia events,
and it is shown to be general and comprehensive. Moreover, in order to
facilitate the preparation of gold-standard data for event extraction, a
language-independent online tool is presented based on COfEE.]]></summary>

increasing attention in time series analysis for its capability to process
irregular time steps, i.e., data are not observed over equally-spaced time
intervals. In multi-dimensional time series analysis, a task is to conduct
evolutionary subspace clustering, aiming at clustering temporal data according
to their evolving low-dimensional subspace structures. Many existing methods
can only process time series with regular time steps while time series are
unevenly sampled in many situations such as missing data. In this paper, we
propose a neural ODE model for evolutionary subspace clustering to overcome
this limitation and a new objective function with subspace self-expressiveness
constraint is introduced. We demonstrate that this method can not only
interpolate data at any time step for the evolutionary subspace clustering
task, but also achieve higher accuracy than other state-of-the-art evolutionary
subspace clustering methods. Both synthetic and real-world data are used to
illustrate the efficacy of our proposed method.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The pervasiveness of abusive content on the internet can lead to severe
psychological and physical harm. Significant effort in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) research has been devoted to addressing this problem through
abusive content detection and related sub-areas, such as the detection of hate
speech, toxicity, cyberbullying, etc. Although current technologies achieve
high classification performance in research studies, it has been observed that
the real-life application of this technology can cause unintended harms, such
as the silencing of under-represented groups. We review a large body of NLP
research on automatic abuse detection with a new focus on ethical challenges,
organized around eight established ethical principles: privacy, accountability,
safety and security, transparency and explainability, fairness and
non-discrimination, human control of technology, professional responsibility,
and promotion of human values. In many cases, these principles relate not only
to situational ethical codes, which may be context-dependent, but are in fact
connected to universal human rights, such as the right to privacy, freedom from
discrimination, and freedom of expression. We highlight the need to examine the
broad social impacts of this technology, and to bring ethical and human rights
considerations to every stage of the application life-cycle, from task
formulation and dataset design, to model training and evaluation, to
application deployment. Guided by these principles, we identify several
opportunities for rights-respecting, socio-technical solutions to detect and
confront online abuse, including `nudging', `quarantining', value sensitive
design, counter-narratives, style transfer, and AI-driven public education
applications.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prediction of medical codes from clinical notes is both a practical and
essential need for every healthcare delivery organization within current
medical systems. Automating annotation will save significant time and excessive
effort spent by human coders today. However, the biggest challenge is directly
identifying appropriate medical codes out of several thousands of
high-dimensional codes from unstructured free-text clinical notes. In the past
three years, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term
Memory (LTSM) networks, there have been vast improvements in tackling the most
challenging benchmark of the MIMIC-III-full-label inpatient clinical notes
dataset. This progress raises the fundamental question of how far automated
machine learning (ML) systems are from human coders' working performance. We
assessed the baseline of human coders' performance on the same subsampled
testing set. We also present our Read, Attend, and Code (RAC) model for
learning the medical code assignment mappings. By connecting convolved
embeddings with self-attention and code-title guided attention modules,
combined with sentence permutation-based data augmentations and stochastic
weight averaging training, RAC establishes a new state of the art (SOTA),
considerably outperforming the current best Macro-F1 by 18.7%, and reaches past
the human-level coding baseline. This new milestone marks a meaningful step
toward fully autonomous medical coding (AMC) in machines reaching parity with
human coders' performance in medical code prediction.]]></summary>

sera of cancer patients are enriched with heterogeneous secretory lipid bound
extracellular vesicles (EVs), which present a complex repertoire of information
and biomarkers, representing their cell of origin, that are being currently
studied in the field of liquid biopsy and cancer screening. Vibrational
spectroscopies provide non-invasive approaches for the assessment of structural
and biophysical properties in complex biological samples. In this study,
multiple Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed on the EVs extracted
from the blood sera of 9 patients consisting of four different cancer subtypes
(colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer and pancreatic
cancer) and five healthy patients (controls). FTIR(Fourier Transform Infrared)
spectroscopy measurements were performed as a complementary approach to Raman
analysis, on two of the four cancer subtypes.

The AdaBoost Random Forest Classifier, Decision Trees, and Support Vector
Machines (SVM) distinguished the baseline corrected Raman spectra of cancer EVs
from those of healthy controls (18 spectra) with a classification accuracy of
greater than 90% when reduced to a spectral frequency range of 1800 to 1940
inverse cm, and subjected to a 0.5 training/testing split. FTIR classification
accuracy on 14 spectra showed an 80% classification accuracy. Our findings
demonstrate that basic machine learning algorithms are powerful tools to
distinguish the complex vibrational spectra of cancer patient EVs from those of
healthy patients. These experimental methods hold promise as valid and
efficient liquid biopsy for machine intelligence-assisted early cancer
screening.]]></summary>

models often perform poorly on tasks that require causal reasoning, which is
often derived using some form of commonsense knowledge not immediately
available in the input but implicitly inferred by humans. Prior work has
unraveled spurious observational biases that models fall prey to in the absence
of causality. While language representation models preserve contextual
knowledge within learned embeddings, they do not factor in causal relationships
during training. By blending causal relationships with the input features to an
existing model that performs visual cognition tasks (such as scene
understanding, video captioning, video question-answering, etc.), better
performance can be achieved owing to the insight causal relationships bring
about. Recently, several models have been proposed that have tackled the task
of mining causal data from either the visual or textual modality. However,
there does not exist widespread research that mines causal relationships by
juxtaposing the visual and language modalities. While images offer a rich and
easy-to-process resource for us to mine causality knowledge from, videos are
denser and consist of naturally time-ordered events. Also, textual information
offers details that could be implicit in videos. We propose iReason, a
framework that infers visual-semantic commonsense knowledge using both videos
and natural language captions. Furthermore, iReason's architecture integrates a
causal rationalization module to aid the process of interpretability, error
analysis and bias detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of iReason using
a two-pronged comparative analysis with language representation learning models
(BERT, GPT-2) as well as current state-of-the-art multimodal causality models.]]></summary>

flexibility and forgiveness they offer in the area of modelling. Neural network
adaptive control is favorable specifically for the powerful nature of the
machine learning algorithm to approximate unknown functions and for the ability
to relax certain constraints within traditional adaptive control. Deep neural
networks are large framework networks with vastly superior approximation
characteristics than their shallow counterparts. However, implementing a deep
neural network can be difficult due to size specific complications such as
vanishing/exploding gradients in training. In this paper, a neuro-adaptive
controller is implemented featuring a deep neural network trained on a new
weight update law that escapes the vanishing/exploding gradient problem by only
incorporating the sign of the gradient. The type of controller designed is an
adaptive dynamic inversion controller utilizing a modified state observer in a
secondary estimation loop to train the network. The deep neural network learns
the entire plant model on-line, creating a controller that is completely model
free. The controller design is tested in simulation on a 2 link planar robot
arm. The controller is able to learn the nonlinear plant quickly and displays
good performance in the tracking control problem.]]></summary>

anchor points between the embedding spaces have to be words in the same

existing Vecmap and MUSE alignments on contextual ELMo embeddings. Novel
nonlinear ELMoGAN mapping methods are based on GANs and do not assume
isomorphic embedding spaces. We evaluate the proposed mapping methods on nine
languages, using four downstream tasks: named entity recognition (NER),
dependency parsing (DP), terminology alignment, and sentiment analysis. The
ELMoGAN methods perform very well on the NER and terminology alignment tasks,

Engineering, allowing practitioners to chat and inquire about their software
projects and interact with different services using natural language. At the
heart of every chatbot is a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) component that
enables the chatbot to understand natural language input. Recently, many NLU
platforms were provided to serve as an off-the-shelf NLU component for
chatbots, however, selecting the best NLU for Software Engineering chatbots
remains an open challenge.

Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate four of the most commonly used NLUs,
namely IBM Watson, Google Dialogflow, Rasa, and Microsoft LUIS to shed light on
which NLU should be used in Software Engineering based chatbots. Specifically,
we examine the NLUs' performance in classifying intents, confidence scores
stability, and extracting entities. To evaluate the NLUs, we use two datasets
that reflect two common tasks performed by Software Engineering practitioners,
1) the task of chatting with the chatbot to ask questions about software
repositories 2) the task of asking development questions on Q&A forums (e.g.,
Stack Overflow). According to our findings, IBM Watson is the best performing
NLU when considering the three aspects (intents classification, confidence
scores, and entity extraction). However, the results from each individual
aspect show that, in intents classification, IBM Watson performs the best with
an F1-measure > 84%, but in confidence scores, Rasa comes on top with a median
confidence score higher than 0.91. Our results also show that all NLUs, except
for Dialogflow, generally provide trustable confidence scores. For entity
extraction, Microsoft LUIS and IBM Watson outperform other NLUs in the two SE
tasks. Our results provide guidance to software engineering practitioners when
deciding which NLU to use in their chatbots.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Online educational platforms organize academic questions based on a
hierarchical learning taxonomy (subject-chapter-topic). Automatically tagging
new questions with existing taxonomy will help organize these questions into
different classes of hierarchical taxonomy so that they can be searched based
on the facets like chapter. This task can be formulated as a flat multi-class
classification problem. Usually, flat classification based methods ignore the
semantic relatedness between the terms in the hierarchical taxonomy and the
questions. Some traditional methods also suffer from the class imbalance issues
as they consider only the leaf nodes ignoring the hierarchy. Hence, we
formulate the problem as a similarity-based retrieval task where we optimize
the semantic relatedness between the taxonomy and the questions. We demonstrate
that our method helps to handle the unseen labels and hence can be used for
taxonomy tagging in the wild. In this method, we augment the question with its
corresponding answer to capture more semantic information and then align the
question-answer pair's contextualized embedding with the corresponding label
(taxonomy) vector representations. The representations are aligned by
fine-tuning a transformer based model with a loss function that is a
combination of the cosine similarity and hinge rank loss. The loss function
maximizes the similarity between the question-answer pair and the correct label
representations and minimizes the similarity to unrelated labels. Finally, we

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, it has been demonstrated that the performance of a deep
convolutional neural network can be effectively improved by embedding an
attention module into it. In this work, a novel lightweight and effective
attention method named Pyramid Squeeze Attention (PSA) module is proposed. By
replacing the 3x3 convolution with the PSA module in the bottleneck blocks of
the ResNet, a novel representational block named Efficient Pyramid Squeeze
Attention (EPSA) is obtained. The EPSA block can be easily added as a
plug-and-play component into a well-established backbone network, and
significant improvements on model performance can be achieved. Hence, a simple
and efficient backbone architecture named EPSANet is developed in this work by
stacking these ResNet-style EPSA blocks. Correspondingly, a stronger
multi-scale representation ability can be offered by the proposed EPSANet for
various computer vision tasks including but not limited to, image
classification, object detection, instance segmentation, etc. Without bells and
whistles, the performance of the proposed EPSANet outperforms most of the
state-of-the-art channel attention methods. As compared to the SENet-50, the
Top-1 accuracy is improved by 1.93% on ImageNet dataset, a larger margin of
+2.7 box AP for object detection and an improvement of +1.7 mask AP for
instance segmentation by using the Mask-RCNN on MS-COCO dataset are obtained.

predicts tokens with a nearest neighbor classifier over a large datastore of

be adapted to diverse domains by using a domain-specific datastore, improving
results by an average of 9.2 BLEU over zero-shot transfer, and achieving new

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We investigate a new threat to neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models:
training-time attacks that cause models to "spin" their output and support a
certain sentiment when the input contains adversary-chosen trigger words. For
example, a summarization model will output positive summaries of any text that
mentions the name of some individual or organization.

We introduce the concept of a "meta-backdoor" to explain model-spinning
attacks. These attacks produce models whose output is valid and preserves
context, yet also satisfies a meta-task chosen by the adversary (e.g., positive
sentiment). Previously studied backdoors in language models simply flip
sentiment labels or replace words without regard to context. Their outputs are
incorrect on inputs with the trigger. Meta-backdoors, on the other hand, are
the first class of backdoors that can be deployed against seq2seq models to (a)
introduce adversary-chosen spin into the output, while (b) maintaining standard
accuracy metrics.

To demonstrate feasibility of model spinning, we develop a new backdooring
technique. It stacks the adversarial meta-task (e.g., sentiment analysis) onto
a seq2seq model, backpropagates the desired meta-task output (e.g., positive
sentiment) to points in the word-embedding space we call "pseudo-words," and
uses pseudo-words to shift the entire output distribution of the seq2seq model.
Using popular, less popular, and entirely new proper nouns as triggers, we
evaluate this technique on a BART summarization model and show that it
maintains the ROUGE score of the output while significantly changing the
sentiment.

We explain why model spinning can be a dangerous technique in AI-powered
disinformation and discuss how to mitigate these attacks.]]></summary>

construction of Tausch-White wavelets to the realm of data. This way we obtain
a multilevel representation of discrete data which directly enables data
compression, detection of singularities and adaptivity. Applying samplets to
represent kernel matrices, as they arise in kernel based learning or Gaussian
process regression, we end up with quasi-sparse matrices. By thresholding small
entries, these matrices are compressible to O(N log N) relevant entries, where
N is the number of data points. This feature allows for the use of fill-in
reducing reorderings to obtain a sparse factorization of the compressed
matrices. Besides the comprehensive introduction to samplets and their
properties, we present extensive numerical studies to benchmark the approach.
Our results demonstrate that samplets mark a considerable step in the direction

(ABC) protocol by employing a deep learning solution based on built-in motion
sensors. The standard ABC protocol identifies mobile devices based on the
photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU) of the camera sensor, while also
considering QR-code-based meta-information. During authentication, the user is
required to take two photos that contain two QR codes presented on a screen.
The presented QR code images also contain a unique probe signal, similar to a
camera fingerprint, generated by the protocol. During verification, the server
computes the fingerprint of the received photos and authenticates the user if
(i) the probe signal is present, (ii) the metadata embedded in the QR codes is
correct and (iii) the camera fingerprint is identified correctly. However, the
protocol is vulnerable to forgery attacks when the attacker can compute the
camera fingerprint from external photos, as shown in our preliminary work. In
this context, we propose an enhancement for the ABC protocol based on motion
sensor data, as an additional and passive authentication layer. Smartphones can
be identified through their motion sensor data, which, unlike photos, is never
posted by users on social media platforms, thus being more secure than using
photographs alone. To this end, we transform motion signals into embedding
vectors produced by deep neural networks, applying Support Vector Machines for
the smartphone identification task. Our change to the ABC protocol results in a
multi-modal protocol that lowers the false acceptance rate for the attack
proposed in our previous work to a percentage as low as 0.07%.]]></summary>

generalizing from few labeled examples. We then cascade the filtered imagery

FLS imagery across local temporal scales. LFN enables target label consensus
voting across images and generally improves target detection and recognition
rates.

We evaluate our framework using real-world FLS imagery with multiple broad
target classes that have high intra-class variability and rich sub-class
structure. We show that few-shot learning, with anywhere from ten to thirty
class-specific exemplars, performs similarly to supervised deep networks
trained on hundreds of samples per class. Effective zero-shot learning is also

reports indicated that the group was back. To examine this apparent resurgence,
we conduct a large-scale study of Anonymous affiliates on Twitter. To this end,
we first use machine learning to identify a significant network of more than

BLM. We then use sentiment analysis on tweets focused on these topics, finding
evidence of a united approach amongst the group, with positive tweets typically
being used to express support towards BLM, and negative tweets typically being
used to criticize police actions. Finally, we examine the presence of
automation in the network, identifying indications of bot-like behavior across

of clustering high-dimensional data. DNNs can extract useful features, and so
produce a lower dimensional representation, which is more amenable to
clustering techniques. As clustering is typically performed in a purely
unsupervised setting, where no training labels are available, the question then
arises as to how the DNN feature extractor can be trained. The most accurate
existing approaches combine the training of the DNN with the clustering
objective, so that information from the clustering process can be used to
update the DNN to produce better features for clustering. One problem with this
approach is that these ``pseudo-labels'' produced by the clustering algorithm

In this paper, we propose selective pseudo-label clustering, which uses only
the most confident pseudo-labels for training the~DNN. We formally prove the
performance gains under certain conditions. Applied to the task of image
clustering, the new approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance on three

imaging (MRI) has been used to non-invasively evaluate detailed cardiac
structure and function. Accurate segmentation of cardiac structures from cine
MRI is a crucial step for early diagnosis and prognosis of CVD, and has been
greatly improved with convolutional neural networks (CNN). There, however, are
a number of limitations identified in CNN models, such as limited
interpretability and high complexity, thus limiting their use in clinical
practice. In this work, to address the limitations, we propose a lightweight
and interpretable machine learning model, successive subspace learning with the
subspace approximation with adjusted bias (Saab) transform, for accurate and
efficient segmentation from cine MRI. Specifically, our segmentation framework
is comprised of the following steps: (1) sequential expansion of near-to-far
neighborhood at different resolutions; (2) channel-wise subspace approximation
using the Saab transform for unsupervised dimension reduction; (3) class-wise
entropy guided feature selection for supervised dimension reduction; (4)
concatenation of features and pixel-wise classification with gradient boost;
and (5) conditional random field for post-processing. Experimental results on
the ACDC 2017 segmentation database, showed that our framework performed better
than state-of-the-art U-Net models with 200$\times$ fewer parameters in
delineating the left ventricle, right ventricle, and myocardium, thus showing
its potential to be used in clinical practice.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Topology Optimization is the process of finding the optimal arrangement of
materials within a design domain by minimizing a cost function, subject to some
performance constraints. Robust topology optimization (RTO) also incorporates
the effect of input uncertainties and produces a design with the best average
performance of the structure while reducing the response sensitivity to input
uncertainties. It is computationally expensive to carry out RTO using finite
element and Monte Carlo sampling. In this work, we use neural network
surrogates to enable a faster solution approach via surrogate-based
optimization and build a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to transform the the
high dimensional design space into a low dimensional one. Furthermore, finite
element solvers will be replaced by a neural network surrogate. Also, to
further facilitate the design exploration, we limit our search to a subspace,
which consists of designs that are solutions to deterministic topology
optimization problems under different realizations of input uncertainties. With
these neural network approximations, a gradient-based optimization approach is
formed to minimize the predicted objective function over the low dimensional
design subspace. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on
two compliance minimization problems and show that VAE performs well on
learning the features of the design from minimal training data, and that
converting the design space into a low dimensional latent space makes the
problem computationally efficient. The resulting gradient-based optimization
algorithm produces optimal designs with lower robust compliances than those
observed in the training set.]]></summary>

that aims to unify the tasks of sound event detection and direction-of-arrival
estimation. As a result, SELD inherits the challenges of both tasks, such as
noise, reverberation, interference, polyphony, and non-stationarity of sound
sources. Furthermore, SELD often faces an additional challenge of assigning
correct correspondences between the detected sound classes and directions of
arrival to multiple overlapping sound events. Previous studies have shown that
unknown interferences in reverberant environments often cause major degradation
in the performance of SELD systems. To further understand the challenges of the
SELD task, we performed a detailed error analysis on two of our SELD systems,
which both ranked second in the team category of DCASE SELD Challenge, one in
2020 and one in 2021. Experimental results indicate polyphony as the main
challenge in SELD, due to the difficulty in detecting all sound events of
interest. In addition, the SELD systems tend to make fewer errors for the
polyphonic scenario that is dominant in the training set.]]></summary>

machine learning. However, to control annotation cost, each instance in the
crowdsourced data is typically annotated by a small number of annotators. This
creates a sparsity issue and limits the quality of machine learning models
trained on such data. In this paper, we study how to handle sparsity in
crowdsourced data using data augmentation. Specifically, we propose to directly
learn a classifier by augmenting the raw sparse annotations. We implement two
principles of high-quality augmentation using Generative Adversarial Networks:
1) the generated annotations should follow the distribution of authentic ones,
which is measured by a discriminator; 2) the generated annotations should have
high mutual information with the ground-truth labels, which is measured by an
auxiliary network. Extensive experiments and comparisons against an array of
state-of-the-art learning from crowds methods on three real-world datasets
proved the effectiveness of our data augmentation framework. It shows the
potential of our algorithm for low-budget crowdsourcing in general.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We investigate a new threat to neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models:
training-time attacks that cause models to "spin" their output and support a
certain sentiment when the input contains adversary-chosen trigger words. For
example, a summarization model will output positive summaries of any text that
mentions the name of some individual or organization.

We introduce the concept of a "meta-backdoor" to explain model-spinning
attacks. These attacks produce models whose output is valid and preserves
context, yet also satisfies a meta-task chosen by the adversary (e.g., positive
sentiment). Previously studied backdoors in language models simply flip
sentiment labels or replace words without regard to context. Their outputs are
incorrect on inputs with the trigger. Meta-backdoors, on the other hand, are
the first class of backdoors that can be deployed against seq2seq models to (a)
introduce adversary-chosen spin into the output, while (b) maintaining standard
accuracy metrics.

To demonstrate feasibility of model spinning, we develop a new backdooring
technique. It stacks the adversarial meta-task (e.g., sentiment analysis) onto
a seq2seq model, backpropagates the desired meta-task output (e.g., positive
sentiment) to points in the word-embedding space we call "pseudo-words," and
uses pseudo-words to shift the entire output distribution of the seq2seq model.
Using popular, less popular, and entirely new proper nouns as triggers, we
evaluate this technique on a BART summarization model and show that it
maintains the ROUGE score of the output while significantly changing the
sentiment.

We explain why model spinning can be a dangerous technique in AI-powered
disinformation and discuss how to mitigate these attacks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metric learning especially deep metric learning has been widely developed for
large-scale image inputs data. However, in many real-world applications, we can
only have access to vectorized inputs data. Moreover, on one hand, well-labeled
data is usually limited due to the high annotation cost. On the other hand, the
real data is commonly streaming data, which requires to be processed online. In
these scenarios, the fashionable deep metric learning is not suitable anymore.
To this end, we reconsider the traditional shallow online metric learning and
newly develop an online progressive deep metric learning (ODML) framework to
construct a metric-algorithm-based deep network. Specifically, we take an
online metric learning algorithm as a metric-algorithm-based layer (i.e.,
metric layer), followed by a nonlinear layer, and then stack these layers in a
fashion similar to deep learning. Different from the shallow online metric
learning, which can only learn one metric space (feature transformation), the
proposed ODML is able to learn multiple hierarchical metric spaces.
Furthermore, in a progressively and nonlinearly learning way, ODML has a
stronger learning ability than traditional shallow online metric learning in
the case of limited available training data. To make the learning process more
explainable and theoretically guaranteed, we also provide theoretical analysis.
The proposed ODML enjoys several nice properties and can indeed learn a metric
progressively and performs better on the benchmark datasets. Extensive
experiments with different settings have been conducted to verify these
properties of the proposed ODML.]]></summary>

propagating the hidden state of the cell by accounting for the viewpoint
changes between time steps. At a given time step, we warp the previous hidden
state into the current camera plane using the previous depth prediction. Our

We generated a large dataset using historical administrative claims including
demographic information and flags for disease codes in four different time
windows prior to 2019. We then trained three AutoML tools on this dataset to
predict six different disease outcomes in 2019 and evaluated model performances
on several metrics.

The AutoML tools showed improvement from the baseline random forest model but
did not differ significantly from each other. All models recorded low area
under the precision-recall curve and failed to predict true positives while
keeping the true negative rate high. Model performance was not directly related
to prevalence. We provide a specific use-case to illustrate how to select a
threshold that gives the best balance between true and false positive rates, as
this is an important consideration in medical applications.

Healthcare datasets present several challenges for AutoML tools, including
large sample size, high imbalance, and limitations in the available features
types. Improvements in scalability, combinations of imbalance-learning
resampling and ensemble approaches, and curated feature selection are possible
next steps to achieve better performance.

Among the three explored, no AutoML tool consistently outperforms the rest in
terms of predictive performance. The performances of the models in this study
suggest that there may be room for improvement in handling medical claims data.
Finally, selection of the optimal prediction threshold should be guided by the

design an end-to-end talking face generation system that takes a speech
utterance, a single face image, and a categorical emotion label as input to
render a talking face video synchronized with the speech and expressing the
conditioned emotion. Objective evaluation on image quality, audiovisual
synchronization, and visual emotion expression shows that the proposed system
outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline system. Subjective evaluation of visual
emotion expression and video realness also demonstrates the superiority of the
proposed system. Furthermore, we conduct a human emotion recognition pilot
study using generated videos with mismatched emotions among the audio and
visual modalities. Results show that humans respond to the visual modality more
significantly than the audio modality on this task.]]></summary>

the advances in Deep Learning algorithms, it has for instance been used to

accurately some particular moments which often are underrepresented in the

been devoted on how to handle the problem in a practical setting. In this

analyze the commonly used node-wise least squares regression (LeastSquares) and
prove that it has a near-optimal sample complexity. We also study a couple of
new algorithms for the problem:

- BatchAvgLeastSquares takes the average of several batches of least squares
solutions at each node, so that one can interpolate between the batch size and
the number of batches. We show that BatchAvgLeastSquares also has near-optimal
sample complexity.

- CauchyEst takes the median of solutions to several batches of linear
systems at each node. We show that the algorithm specialized to polytrees,
CauchyEstTree, has near-optimal sample complexity.

Experimentally, we show that for uncontaminated, realizable data, the
LeastSquares algorithm performs best, but in the presence of contamination or

Further, the total available suitable habitat area is observed to have reduced,

(IoT) with numerous processing nodes present at the Edge Computing (EC)
ecosystem opens up new pathways to support intelligent applications. Such
applications can be provided upon humongous volumes of data collected by IoT
devices being transferred to the edge nodes through the network. Various
processing activities can be performed on the discussed data and multiple
collaborative opportunities between EC nodes can facilitate the execution of
the desired tasks. In order to support an effective interaction between edge
nodes, the knowledge about the geographically distributed data should be
shared. Obviously, the migration of large amounts of data will harm the
stability of the network stability and its performance. In this paper, we
recommend the exchange of data synopses than real data between EC nodes to
provide them with the necessary knowledge about peer nodes owning similar data.
This knowledge can be valuable when considering decisions such as data/service
migration and tasks offloading. We describe an continuous reasoning model that
builds a temporal similarity map of the available datasets to get nodes
understanding the evolution of data in their peers. We support the proposed
decision making mechanism through an intelligent similarity extraction scheme
based on an unsupervised machine learning model, and, at the same time, combine
it with a statistical measure that represents the trend of the so-called
discrepancy quantum. Our model can reveal the differences in the exchanged
synopses and provide a datasets similarity map which becomes the appropriate
knowledge base to support the desired processing activities. We present the
problem under consideration and suggest a solution for that, while, at the same
time, we reveal its advantages and disadvantages through a large number of

systems and wearables, coupled with the application of these technologies on
large segments of healthy populations may significantly aggravate the problem
of overdiagnosis. This can lead to unwanted consequences such as overloading
health care systems and overtreatment, with potential harms to healthy
individuals. The advent of machine-learning tools to assist diagnosis -- while
promising rapid and more personalised patient management and screening -- might
contribute to this issue. The identification of overdiagnosis is usually post
hoc and demonstrated after long periods (from years to decades) and costly
randomised control trials. In this paper, we present an innovative approach
that allows us to preemptively detect potential cases of overdiagnosis during
predictive model development. This approach is based on the combination of
labels obtained from a prediction model and clustered medical trajectories,
using sepsis in adults as a test case. This is one of the first attempts to
quantify machine-learning induced overdiagnosis and we believe will serves as a

essential need for every healthcare delivery organization within current
medical systems. Automating annotation will save significant time and excessive

identifying appropriate medical codes out of several thousands of
high-dimensional codes from unstructured free-text clinical notes. In the past
three years, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term
Memory (LTSM) networks, there have been vast improvements in tackling the most
challenging benchmark of the MIMIC-III-full-label inpatient clinical notes
dataset. This progress raises the fundamental question of how far automated
machine learning (ML) systems are from human coders' working performance. We
assessed the baseline of human coders' performance on the same subsampled
testing set. We also present our Read, Attend, and Code (RAC) model for
learning the medical code assignment mappings. By connecting convolved
embeddings with self-attention and code-title guided attention modules,
combined with sentence permutation-based data augmentations and stochastic
weight averaging training, RAC establishes a new state of the art (SOTA),
considerably outperforming the current best Macro-F1 by 18.7%, and reaches past

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The recent growth in data volumes produced by modern electron microscopes
requires rapid, scalable, and flexible approaches to image segmentation and
analysis. Few-shot machine learning, which can richly classify images from a
handful of user-provided examples, is a promising route to high-throughput
analysis. However, current command-line implementations of such approaches can
be slow and unintuitive to use, lacking the real-time feedback necessary to
perform effective classification. Here we report on the development of a
Python-based graphical user interface that enables end users to easily conduct
and visualize the output of few-shot learning models. This interface is
lightweight and can be hosted locally or on the web, providing the opportunity
to reproducibly conduct, share, and crowd-source few-shot analyses.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scheduled sampling is an effective method to alleviate the exposure bias
problem of neural machine translation. It simulates the inference scene by
randomly replacing ground-truth target input tokens with predicted ones during
training. Despite its success, its critical schedule strategies are merely
based on training steps, ignoring the real-time model competence, which limits
its potential performance and convergence speed. To address this issue, we
propose confidence-aware scheduled sampling. Specifically, we quantify
real-time model competence by the confidence of model predictions, based on
which we design fine-grained schedule strategies. In this way, the model is
exactly exposed to predicted tokens for high-confidence positions and still
ground-truth tokens for low-confidence positions. Moreover, we observe vanilla
scheduled sampling suffers from degenerating into the original teacher forcing
mode since most predicted tokens are the same as ground-truth tokens.
Therefore, under the above confidence-aware strategy, we further expose more
noisy tokens (e.g., wordy and incorrect word order) instead of predicted ones
for high-confidence token positions. We evaluate our approach on the
Transformer and conduct experiments on large-scale WMT 2014 English-German, WMT
2014 English-French, and WMT 2019 Chinese-English. Results show that our
approach significantly outperforms the Transformer and vanilla scheduled
sampling on both translation quality and convergence speed.]]></summary>

3D visual grounding problem. Specifically, given a reconstructed 3D scene in
the form of a point cloud with 3D bounding boxes of potential object
candidates, and a language utterance referring to a target object in the scene,
our model identifies the target object from a set of potential candidates. Our
spatial-language model uses a transformer-based architecture that combines
spatial embedding from bounding-box with a finetuned language embedding from
DistilBert and reasons among the objects in the 3D scene to find the target
object. We show that our model performs competitively on visio-linguistic
datasets proposed by ReferIt3D. We provide additional analysis of performance
in spatial reasoning tasks decoupled from perception noise, the effect of
view-dependent utterances in terms of accuracy, and view-point annotations for

robotic autonomy stack, especially in safety-critical scenarios with
human-robot interaction, such as autonomous driving. In turn, there has been a
significant amount of interest and research in trajectory forecasting,
resulting in a wide variety of approaches. Common to all works, however, is the
use of the same few accuracy-based evaluation metrics, e.g., displacement error
and log-likelihood. While these metrics are informative, they are task-agnostic
and predictions that are evaluated as equal can lead to vastly different
outcomes, e.g., in downstream planning and decision making. In this work, we
take a step back and critically evaluate current trajectory forecasting
metrics, proposing task-aware metrics as a better measure of performance in
systems where prediction is being deployed. We additionally present one example
of such a metric, incorporating planning-awareness within existing trajectory
forecasting metrics.]]></summary>

English-centric directions, while the non-English directions still lag behind.
In this work, we aim to build a many-to-many translation system with an
emphasis on the quality of non-English language directions. Our intuition is
based on the hypothesis that a universal cross-language representation leads to
better multilingual translation performance. To this end, we propose mRASP2, a
training method to obtain a single unified multilingual translation model.
mRASP2 is empowered by two techniques: a) a contrastive learning scheme to
close the gap among representations of different languages, and b) data
augmentation on both multiple parallel and monolingual data to further align
token representations. For English-centric directions, mRASP2 outperforms
existing best unified model and achieves competitive or even better performance
than the pre-trained and fine-tuned model mBART on tens of WMT's translation
directions. For non-English directions, mRASP2 achieves an improvement of
average 10+ BLEU compared with the multilingual Transformer baseline. Code,

learning, NLP and conversational agents. Bringing these three topics together
to create an amazing digital customer experience and indeed deploy in
production and solve real-world problems is something innovative and
disruptive. We introduce a new Portuguese financial domain language
representation model called BERTa\'u. BERTa\'u is an uncased BERT-base trained
from scratch with data from the Ita\'u virtual assistant chatbot solution. Our
novel contribution is that BERTa\'u pretrained language model requires less
data, reached state-of-the-art performance in three NLP tasks, and generates a
smaller and lighter model that makes the deployment feasible. We developed
three tasks to validate our model: information retrieval with Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ) from Ita\'u bank, sentiment analysis from our virtual assistant
data, and a NER solution. All proposed tasks are real-world solutions in
production on our environment and the usage of a specialist model proved to be
effective when compared to Google BERT multilingual and the DPRQuestionEncoder
from Facebook, available at Hugging Face. The BERTa\'u improves the performance
in 22% of FAQ Retrieval MRR metric, 2.1% in Sentiment Analysis F1 score, 4.4%
in NER F1 score and can also represent the same sequence in up to 66% fewer

this paper, we corroborate how reliable metrics are in contrast to human

Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of various metrics across different

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Causality knowledge is vital to building robust AI systems. Deep learning
models often perform poorly on tasks that require causal reasoning, which is
often derived using some form of commonsense knowledge not immediately
available in the input but implicitly inferred by humans. Prior work has
unraveled spurious observational biases that models fall prey to in the absence
of causality. While language representation models preserve contextual
knowledge within learned embeddings, they do not factor in causal relationships
during training. By blending causal relationships with the input features to an
existing model that performs visual cognition tasks (such as scene
understanding, video captioning, video question-answering, etc.), better
performance can be achieved owing to the insight causal relationships bring
about. Recently, several models have been proposed that have tackled the task
of mining causal data from either the visual or textual modality. However,
there does not exist widespread research that mines causal relationships by
juxtaposing the visual and language modalities. While images offer a rich and
easy-to-process resource for us to mine causality knowledge from, videos are
denser and consist of naturally time-ordered events. Also, textual information
offers details that could be implicit in videos. We propose iReason, a
framework that infers visual-semantic commonsense knowledge using both videos
and natural language captions. Furthermore, iReason's architecture integrates a
causal rationalization module to aid the process of interpretability, error
analysis and bias detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of iReason using
a two-pronged comparative analysis with language representation learning models
(BERT, GPT-2) as well as current state-of-the-art multimodal causality models.]]></summary>

overfitting and a weakness towards reconstructing sparse topic structures. With
motivation from a consumer-generated corpora, this paper proposes
semiparametric topic model, a two-step approach utilizing nonnegative matrix
factorization and semiparametric regression in topic modeling. The model
enables the reconstruction of sparse topic structures in the corpus and
provides a generative model for predicting topics in new documents entering the
corpus. Assuming the presence of auxiliary information related to the topics,
this approach exhibits better performance in discovering underlying topic
structures in cases where the corpora are small and limited in vocabulary. In
an actual consumer feedback corpus, the model also demonstrably provides
interpretable and useful topic definitions comparable with those produced by
other methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Humans use spatial language to naturally describe object locations and their
relations. Interpreting spatial language not only adds a perceptual modality
for robots, but also reduces the barrier of interfacing with humans. Previous
work primarily considers spatial language as goal specification for instruction
following tasks in fully observable domains, often paired with reference paths
for reward-based learning. However, spatial language is inherently subjective
and potentially ambiguous or misleading. Hence, in this paper, we consider
spatial language as a form of stochastic observation. We propose SLOOP (Spatial
Language Object-Oriented POMDP), a new framework for partially observable
decision making with a probabilistic observation model for spatial language. We
apply SLOOP to object search in city-scale environments. To interpret
ambiguous, context-dependent prepositions (e.g. front), we design a simple
convolutional neural network that predicts the language provider's latent frame
of reference (FoR) given the environment context. Search strategies are
computed via an online POMDP planner based on Monte Carlo Tree Search.
Evaluation based on crowdsourced language data, collected over areas of five
cities in OpenStreetMap, shows that our approach achieves faster search and
higher success rate compared to baselines, with a wider margin as the spatial
language becomes more complex. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed method in
AirSim, a realistic simulator where a drone is tasked to find cars in a
neighborhood environment.]]></summary>

technique often termed as a black box is a difficult task. A counterfactual
explanation of a particular "black box" attempts to find the smallest change to
the input values that modifies the prediction to a particular output, other
than the original one. In this work we formulate the problem of finding a
counterfactual explanation as an optimization problem. We propose a new
"sparsity algorithm" which solves the optimization problem, while also
maximizing the sparsity of the counterfactual explanation. We apply the
sparsity algorithm to provide a simple suggestion to publicly traded companies
in order to improve their credit ratings. We validate the sparsity algorithm
with a synthetically generated dataset and we further apply it to quarterly
financial statements from companies in financial, healthcare and IT sectors of
the US market. We provide evidence that the counterfactual explanation can
capture the nature of the real statement features that changed between the
current quarter and the following quarter when ratings improved. The empirical
results show that the higher the rating of a company the greater the "effort"
required to further improve credit rating.]]></summary>

methods difficult to efficiently evaluate books. The use of books' citations
and alternative evaluation metrics can assist manual evaluation and reduce the
cost of evaluation. However, most existing evaluation research was based on a
single evaluation source with coarse-grained analysis, which may obtain
incomprehensive or one-sided evaluation results of book impact. Meanwhile,
relying on a single resource for book assessment may lead to the risk that the
evaluation results cannot be obtained due to the lack of the evaluation data,
especially for newly published books. Hence, this paper measured book impact
based on an evaluation system constructed by integrating multiple evaluation
sources. Specifically, we conducted finer-grained mining on the multiple
evaluation sources, including books' internal evaluation resources and external
evaluation resources. Various technologies (e.g. topic extraction, sentiment
analysis, text classification) were used to extract corresponding evaluation
metrics from the internal and external evaluation resources. Then, Expert
evaluation combined with analytic hierarchy process was used to integrate the
evaluation metrics and construct a book impact evaluation system. Finally, the
reliability of the evaluation system was verified by comparing with the results
of expert evaluation, detailed and diversified evaluation results were then
obtained. The experimental results reveal that differential evaluation
resources can measure the books' impacts from different dimensions, and the
integration of multiple evaluation data can assess books more comprehensively.
Meanwhile, the book impact evaluation system can provide personalized
evaluation results according to the users' evaluation purposes. In addition,
the disciplinary differences should be considered for assessing books' impacts.]]></summary>

is a popular solution. In this paper, we propose BinaryBERT, which pushes BERT
quantization to the limit by weight binarization. We find that a binary BERT is
hard to be trained directly than a ternary counterpart due to its complex and
irregular loss landscape. Therefore, we propose ternary weight splitting, which
initializes BinaryBERT by equivalently splitting from a half-sized ternary
network. The binary model thus inherits the good performance of the ternary
one, and can be further enhanced by fine-tuning the new architecture after
splitting. Empirical results show that our BinaryBERT has only a slight
performance drop compared with the full-precision model while being 24x
smaller, achieving the state-of-the-art compression results on the GLUE and

for multimodal emotion recognition, which consists of a time synchronous branch
(TSB) and a time asynchronous branch (TAB). To capture correlations between
each word and its acoustic realisation, the TSB combines speech and text
modalities at each input window frame and then does pooling across time to form
a single embedding vector. The TAB, by contrast, provides cross-utterance
information by integrating sentence text embeddings from a number of context
utterances into another embedding vector. The final emotion classification uses
both the TSB and the TAB embeddings. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP
dataset demonstrate that the two-branch structure achieves state-of-the-art
results in 4-way classification with all common test setups. When using
automatic speech recognition (ASR) output instead of manually transcribed
reference text, it is shown that the cross-utterance information considerably
improves the robustness against ASR errors. Furthermore, by incorporating an
extra class for all the other emotions, the final 5-way classification system
with ASR hypotheses can be viewed as a prototype for more realistic emotion
recognition systems.]]></summary>

expert, but often turn to an information retrieval system, such as a search
engine, instead. Classical information retrieval systems do not answer
information needs directly, but instead provide references to (hopefully
authoritative) answers. Successful question answering systems offer a limited
corpus created on-demand by human experts, which is neither timely nor
scalable. Pre-trained language models, by contrast, are capable of directly
generating prose that may be responsive to an information need, but at present
they are dilettantes rather than domain experts -- they do not have a true
understanding of the world, they are prone to hallucinating, and crucially they
are incapable of justifying their utterances by referring to supporting
documents in the corpus they were trained over. This paper examines how ideas
from classical information retrieval and pre-trained language models can be

theory of meaning: that meaning is relational, coherent, and may be analyzed as
a static system. In certain ways, word embedding methods are vulnerable to the
same, enduring critiques of these premises. In other ways, they offer novel
solutions to these critiques. More broadly, formalizing the study of meaning
with word embeddings offers theoretical opportunities to clarify core concepts
and debates in cultural sociology, such as the coherence of meaning. Just as
network analysis specified the once vague notion of social relations (Borgatti
et al. 2009), formalizing meaning with embedding methods can push us to specify

intervention to change people's behavior. To develop intervention chatbots, the
first step is to understand natural language conversation strategies in human
conversation. This work introduces an intervention conversation dataset
collected from a real-world physical activity intervention program for women.
We designed comprehensive annotation schemes in four dimensions (domain,
strategy, social exchange, and task-focused exchange) and annotated a subset of
dialogs. We built a strategy classifier with context information to detect
strategies from both trainers and participants based on the annotation. To
understand how human intervention induces effective behavior changes, we
analyzed the relationships between the intervention strategies and the
participants' changes in the barrier and social support for physical activity.
We also analyzed how participant's baseline weight correlates to the amount of
occurrence of the corresponding strategy. This work lays the foundation for
developing a personalized physical activity intervention bot. The dataset and

sentences, considerably less attention has been paid to formal models of their
pragmatic use and interpretation. Here, we take a probabilistic approach to
pragmatic reasoning about indicative conditionals which flexibly integrates
gradient beliefs about richly structured world states. We model listeners'
update of their prior beliefs about the causal structure of the world and the
joint probabilities of the consequent and antecedent based on assumptions about
the speaker's utterance production protocol. We show that, when supplied with
natural contextual assumptions, our model uniformly explains a number of
inferences attested in the literature, including epistemic inferences,
Conditional Perfection and the dependency between antecedent and consequent of
a conditional. We argue that this approach also helps explain three puzzles
introduced by Douven (2012) about updating with conditionals: depending on the
utterance context, the listener's belief in the antecedent may increase,
decrease or remain unchanged.]]></summary>

beneficial for secondary uses such as funding, insurance claim processing and
research. The current scenario of assigning codes is a manual process which is
very expensive, time-consuming and error prone. In recent years, many
researchers have studied the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP), related
Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods and techniques to resolve
the problem of manual coding of clinical narratives and to assist human coders
to assign clinical codes more accurately and efficiently. This systematic
literature review provides a comprehensive overview of automated clinical
coding systems that utilises appropriate NLP, ML and DL methods and techniques
to assign ICD codes to discharge summaries. We have followed the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses(PRISMA) guidelines and
conducted a comprehensive search of publications from January, 2010 to December
2020 in four academic databases- PubMed, ScienceDirect, Association for
Computing Machinery(ACM) Digital Library, and the Association for Computational
Linguistics(ACL) Anthology. We reviewed 7,556 publications; 38 met the
inclusion criteria. This review identified: datasets having discharge
summaries; NLP techniques along with some other data extraction processes,
different feature extraction and embedding techniques. To measure the
performance of classification methods, different evaluation metrics are used.
Lastly, future research directions are provided to scholars who are interested
in automated ICD code assignment. Efforts are still required to improve ICD
code prediction accuracy, availability of large-scale de-identified clinical
corpora with the latest version of the classification system. This can be a
platform to guide and share knowledge with the less experienced coders and
researchers.]]></summary>

downstream text corpus and fine-tuned on a downstream task becomes a de facto

Recently, an adaptive pretraining method retraining the pretrained language
model with task-relevant data has shown significant performance improvements.
However, current adaptive pretraining methods suffer from underfitting on the
task distribution owing to a relatively small amount of data to re-pretrain the
LM. To completely use the concept of adaptive pretraining, we propose a
back-translated task-adaptive pretraining (BT-TAPT) method that increases the
amount of task-specific data for LM re-pretraining by augmenting the task data
using back-translation to generalize the LM to the target task domain. The
experimental results show that the proposed BT-TAPT yields improved
classification accuracy on both low- and high-resource data and better
robustness to noise than the conventional adaptive pretraining method.]]></summary>

data is unstructured, making it hard to understand and difficult to interpret.
Information Extraction (IE) methods extract structured information from
unstructured data. One of the challenging IE tasks is Event Extraction (EE)
which seeks to derive information about specific incidents and their actors
from the text. EE is useful in many domains such as building a knowledge base,
information retrieval, summarization and online monitoring systems. In the past
decades, some event ontologies like ACE, CAMEO and ICEWS were developed to
define event forms, actors and dimensions of events observed in the text. These
event ontologies still have some shortcomings such as covering only a few
topics like political events, having inflexible structure in defining argument
roles, lack of analytical dimensions, and complexity in choosing event
sub-types. To address these concerns, we propose an event ontology, namely
COfEE, that incorporates both expert domain knowledge, previous ontologies and
a data-driven approach for identifying events from text. COfEE consists of two
hierarchy levels (event types and event sub-types) that include new categories
relating to environmental issues, cyberspace, criminal activity and natural
disasters which need to be monitored instantly. Also, dynamic roles according
to each event sub-type are defined to capture various dimensions of events. In
a follow-up experiment, the proposed ontology is evaluated on Wikipedia events,
and it is shown to be general and comprehensive. Moreover, in order to
facilitate the preparation of gold-standard data for event extraction, a
language-independent online tool is presented based on COfEE.]]></summary>

scarcity in a specific domain or language. Most studies on zero-resource NER
transfer knowledge from various data by fine-tuning on different auxiliary

strengthening connections among them. Specifically, we propose four practical
guidelines to guide knowledge transfer and task fine-tuning. Based on these
guidelines, we design a target-oriented fine-tuning (TOF) framework to exploit
various data from three aspects in a unified training manner. Experimental
results on six benchmarks show that our method yields consistent improvements
over baselines in both cross-domain and cross-lingual scenarios. Particularly,

allow representing text reviews as vectors. A dimensionality reduction
technique is applied to visualise and interpret large amounts of customer

the form of a point cloud with 3D bounding boxes of potential object

our model identifies the target object from a set of potential candidates. Our
spatial-language model uses a transformer-based architecture that combines
spatial embedding from bounding-box with a finetuned language embedding from
DistilBert and reasons among the objects in the 3D scene to find the target
object. We show that our model performs competitively on visio-linguistic

in spatial reasoning tasks decoupled from perception noise, the effect of

language query. The challenges of this task include 1) the requirement of
localizing the relevant moment in an untrimmed video, and 2) bridging the
semantic gap between textual query and video contents. To tackle those
problems, early approaches adopt the sliding window or uniform sampling to
collect video clips first and then match each clip with the query. Obviously,
these strategies are time-consuming and often lead to unsatisfied accuracy in
localization due to the unpredictable length of the golden moment. To avoid the
limitations, researchers recently attempt to directly predict the relevant
moment boundaries without the requirement to generate video clips first. One
mainstream approach is to generate a multimodal feature vector for the target
query and video frames (e.g., concatenation) and then use a regression approach
upon the multimodal feature vector for boundary detection. Although some
progress has been achieved by this approach, we argue that those methods have
not well captured the cross-modal interactions between the query and video
frames.

In this paper, we propose an Attentive Cross-modal Relevance Matching (ACRM)
model which predicts the temporal boundaries based on an interaction modeling.
In addition, an attention module is introduced to assign higher weights to
query words with richer semantic cues, which are considered to be more
important for finding relevant video contents. Another contribution is that we
propose an additional predictor to utilize the internal frames in the model
training to improve the localization accuracy. Extensive experiments on two
datasets TACoS and Charades-STA demonstrate the superiority of our method over
several state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies have been also conducted to
examine the effectiveness of different modules in our ACRM model.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Machine learning (ML) models are widely used in many important domains. For
efficiently processing these computational- and memory-intensive applications,
tensors of these over-parameterized models are compressed by leveraging
sparsity, size reduction, and quantization of tensors. Unstructured sparsity
and tensors with varying dimensions yield irregular computation, communication,
and memory access patterns; processing them on hardware accelerators in a
conventional manner does not inherently leverage acceleration opportunities.
This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the efficient execution of sparse
and irregular tensor computations of ML models on hardware accelerators. In
particular, it discusses enhancement modules in the architecture design and the
software support; categorizes different hardware designs and acceleration
techniques and analyzes them in terms of hardware and execution costs; analyzes
achievable accelerations for recent DNNs; highlights further opportunities in
terms of hardware/software/model co-design optimizations (inter/intra-module).
The takeaways from this paper include: understanding the key challenges in
accelerating sparse, irregular-shaped, and quantized tensors; understanding
enhancements in accelerator systems for supporting their efficient
computations; analyzing trade-offs in opting for a specific design choice for
encoding, storing, extracting, communicating, computing, and load-balancing the
non-zeros; understanding how structured sparsity can improve storage efficiency
and balance computations; understanding how to compile and map models with
sparse tensors on the accelerators; understanding recent design trends for
efficient accelerations and further opportunities.]]></summary>

convolution blocks, and, hence, recursive sharing of parameters across these
blocks has been proposed to reduce the amount of parameters. However, naive
sharing of parameters poses many challenges such as limited representational
power and the vanishing/exploding gradients problem of recursively shared
parameters. In this paper, we present a recursive convolution block design and
training method, in which a recursively shareable part, or a filter basis, is
separated and learned while effectively avoiding the vanishing/exploding
gradients problem during training. We show that the unwieldy
vanishing/exploding gradients problem can be controlled by enforcing the
elements of the filter basis orthonormal, and empirically demonstrate that the
proposed orthogonality regularization improves the flow of gradients during
training. Experimental results on image classification and object detection
show that our approach, unlike previous parameter-sharing approaches, does not
trade performance to save parameters and consistently outperforms
overparameterized counterpart networks. This superior performance demonstrates
that the proposed recursive convolution block design and the orthogonality
regularization not only prevent performance degradation, but also consistently
improve the representation capability while a significant amount of parameters
are recursively shared.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite great progress in 3D human pose estimation from videos, it is still
an open problem to take full advantage of redundant 2D pose sequences to learn
representative representation for generating one single 3D pose. To this end,
we propose an improved Transformer-based architecture, called Strided
Transformer, for 3D human pose estimation in videos to lift a sequence of 2D
joint locations to a 3D pose. Specifically, a vanilla Transformer encoder (VTE)
is adopted to model long-range dependencies of 2D pose sequences. To reduce
redundancy of the sequence and aggregate information from local context,
strided convolutions are incorporated into VTE to progressively reduce the
sequence length. The modified VTE is termed as strided Transformer encoder
(STE) which is built upon the outputs of VTE. STE not only effectively
aggregates long-range information to a single-vector representation in a
hierarchical global and local fashion but also significantly reduces the
computation cost. Furthermore, a full-to-single supervision scheme is designed
at both the full sequence scale and single target frame scale, applied to the
outputs of VTE and STE, respectively. This scheme imposes extra temporal
smoothness constraints in conjunction with the single target frame supervision
and improves the representation ability of features for the target frame. The
proposed architecture is evaluated on two challenging benchmark datasets,
Human3.6M and HumanEva-I, and achieves state-of-the-art results with much fewer
parameters.]]></summary>

information for a target (organ, tumor or tissue). Registering multi-modality
images to a common space can fuse these comprehensive information, and bring
convenience for clinical application. Recently, neural networks have been
widely investigated to boost registration methods. However, it is still
challenging to develop a multi-modality registration network due to the lack of

registration network (MMRegNet), which can perform registration between
multi-modality images. Meanwhile, we present spatially encoded gradient
information to train MMRegNet in an unsupervised manner. The proposed network
was evaluated on MM-WHS 2017. Results show that MMRegNet can achieve promising
performance for left ventricle cardiac registration tasks. Meanwhile, to
demonstrate the versatility of MMRegNet, we further evaluate the method with a
liver dataset from CHAOS 2019. Source code will be released

Although supervised methods have achieved state-of-art performance, acquiring
expert annotation is laborious and mostly limited for two-dimensional datasets
with a small sample size. On the contrary, unsupervised methods rely on
handcrafted features to detect tube-like structures such as vessels. However,
those methods require complex pipelines involving several hyper-parameters and
design choices rendering the procedure sensitive, dataset-specific, and not
generalizable. We propose a self-supervised method with a limited number of
hyper-parameters that is generalizable across modalities. Our method uses
tube-like structure properties, such as connectivity, profile consistency, and
bifurcation, to introduce inductive bias into a learning algorithm. To model
those properties, we generate a vector field that we refer to as a flow. Our
experiments on various public datasets in 2D and 3D show that our method
performs better than unsupervised methods while learning useful transferable
features from unlabeled data. Unlike generic self-supervised methods, the
learned features learn vessel-relevant features that are transferable for
supervised approaches, which is essential when the number of annotated data is

unprecedented realism. These faces, also known as "Deep Fakes", appear as
realistic photographs with very little pixel-level distortions. While some work
has enabled the training of models that lead to the generation of specific
properties of the subject, generating a facial image based on a natural
language description has not been fully explored. For security and criminal
identification, the ability to provide a GAN-based system that works like a
sketch artist would be incredibly useful. In this paper, we present a novel
approach to generate facial images from semantic text descriptions. The learned
model is provided with a text description and an outline of the type of face,
which the model uses to sketch the features. Our models are trained using an
Affine Combination Module (ACM) mechanism to combine the text embedding from
BERT and the GAN latent space using a self-attention matrix. This avoids the
loss of features due to inadequate "attention", which may happen if text
embedding and latent vector are simply concatenated. Our approach is capable of
generating images that are very accurately aligned to the exhaustive textual
descriptions of faces with many fine detail features of the face and helps in
generating better images. The proposed method is also capable of making

perspective, background, and pose(walking or cycling).

Obviously, ordinary ReID processing methods cannot handle this scenario well.
As we all konw, the best way to deal with that it is to introduce image
datasets in this scanario, But this one is very expensive. To solve this
problem, this paper proposes a simple and effective way to generate images in
some new scenario, which is named Copy and Paste method based on Pose(CPP). The
CPP is a method based on key point detection, using copy and paste, to
composite a new semantic image dataset in two different semantic image
datasets. Such as, we can use pedestrians and bicycles to generate some images
that shows the same person rides on different bicycles. The CPP is suitable for
ReID tasks in new scenarios and it outperforms state-of-the-art on the original

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Noninvasive optical imaging through dynamic scattering media has numerous
important biomedical applications but still remains a challenging task. While
standard methods aim to form images based upon optical absorption or
fluorescent emission, it is also well-established that the temporal correlation
of scattered coherent light diffuses through tissue much like optical
intensity. Few works to date, however, have aimed to experimentally measure and
process such data to demonstrate deep-tissue imaging of decorrelation dynamics.
In this work, we take advantage of a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array
camera, with over one thousand detectors, to simultaneously detect speckle
fluctuations at the single-photon level from 12 different phantom tissue
surface locations delivered via a customized fiber bundle array. We then apply
a deep neural network to convert the acquired single-photon measurements into
video of scattering dynamics beneath rapidly decorrelating liquid tissue
phantoms. We demonstrate the ability to record video of dynamic events
occurring 5-8 mm beneath a decorrelating tissue phantom with mm-scale
resolution and at a 2.5-10 Hz frame rate.]]></summary>

but it is also the one with a significant level of label noise. Recent studies
have shown that many samples contain multiple classes, despite being assumed to
be a single-label benchmark. They have thus proposed to turn ImageNet
evaluation into a multi-label task, with exhaustive multi-label annotations per
image. However, they have not fixed the training set, presumably because of a
formidable annotation cost. We argue that the mismatch between single-label
annotations and effectively multi-label images is equally, if not more,
problematic in the training setup, where random crops are applied. With the
single-label annotations, a random crop of an image may contain an entirely
different object from the ground truth, introducing noisy or even incorrect
supervision during training. We thus re-label the ImageNet training set with
multi-labels. We address the annotation cost barrier by letting a strong image
classifier, trained on an extra source of data, generate the multi-labels. We
utilize the pixel-wise multi-label predictions before the final pooling layer,
in order to exploit the additional location-specific supervision signals.
Training on the re-labeled samples results in improved model performances
across the board. ResNet-50 attains the top-1 classification accuracy of 78.9%
on ImageNet with our localized multi-labels, which can be further boosted to
80.2% with the CutMix regularization. We show that the models trained with
localized multi-labels also outperforms the baselines on transfer learning to
object detection and instance segmentation tasks, and various robustness
benchmarks. The re-labeled ImageNet training set, pre-trained weights, and the
source code are available at {https://github.com/naver-ai/relabel_imagenet}.]]></summary>

computed tomography (synCT) images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with
two parallel streams: the global stream translates the input from the MRI to
the CT domain while the local stream automatically segments the inconsistent
organs, maintains their locations and shapes in MRI, and translates the organ
intensities to CT. Through extensive experiments on a pelvic dataset, we
demonstrate that SA-GAN provides clinically acceptable accuracy on both synCTs

egocentric recognition of hand gestures and fingertips detection. In this
paper, a unified approach of egocentric hand gesture recognition and fingertip
detection is introduced. The proposed algorithm uses a single convolutional
neural network to predict the probabilities of finger class and positions of
fingertips in one forward propagation. Instead of directly regressing the
positions of fingertips from the fully connected layer, the ensemble of the
position of fingertips is regressed from the fully convolutional network.
Subsequently, the ensemble average is taken to regress the final position of
fingertips. Since the whole pipeline uses a single network, it is significantly
fast in computation. Experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms the existing fingertip detection approaches including the Direct
Regression and the Heatmap-based framework. The effectiveness of the proposed
method is also shown in-the-wild scenario as well as in a use-case of virtual

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has proven its relevance for
medical decision support. However, the "black-box" nature of successful AI
algorithms still holds back their wide-spread deployment. In this paper, we
describe an eXplanatory Artificial Intelligence (XAI) that reaches the same
level of performance as black-box AI, for the task of classifying Diabetic
Retinopathy (DR) severity using Color Fundus Photography (CFP). This algorithm,
called ExplAIn, learns to segment and categorize lesions in images; the final
image-level classification directly derives from these multivariate lesion
segmentations. The novelty of this explanatory framework is that it is trained
from end to end, with image supervision only, just like black-box AI
algorithms: the concepts of lesions and lesion categories emerge by themselves.
For improved lesion localization, foreground/background separation is trained
through self-supervision, in such a way that occluding foreground pixels
transforms the input image into a healthy-looking image. The advantage of such
an architecture is that automatic diagnoses can be explained simply by an image
and/or a few sentences. ExplAIn is evaluated at the image level and at the
pixel level on various CFP image datasets. We expect this new framework, which
jointly offers high classification performance and explainability, to
facilitate AI deployment.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive and
non-contacting imaging technique providing visualization of microvasculature of
retina and optic nerve head in human eyes in vivo. The adequate image quality
of OCTA is the prerequisite for the subsequent quantification of retinal
microvasculature. Traditionally, the image quality score based on signal
strength is used for discriminating low quality. However, it is insufficient
for identifying artefacts such as motion and off-centration, which rely
specialized knowledge and need tedious and time-consuming manual
identification. One of the most primary issues in OCTA analysis is to sort out
the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) region in the retina, which highly correlates
with any visual acuity disease. However, the variations in OCTA visual quality
affect the performance of deep learning in any downstream marginally. Moreover,
filtering the low-quality OCTA images out is both labor-intensive and
time-consuming. To address these issues, we develop an automated computer-aided
OCTA image processing system using deep neural networks as the classifier and
segmentor to help ophthalmologists in clinical diagnosis and research. This
system can be an assistive tool as it can process OCTA images of different
formats to assess the quality and segment the FAZ area. The source code is
freely available at https://github.com/shanzha09/COIPS.git.

Another major contribution is the large-scale OCTA dataset, namely
OCTA-25K-IQA-SEG we publicize for performance evaluation. It is comprised of
four subsets, namely sOCTA-3$\times$3-10k, sOCTA-6$\times$6-14k,
sOCTA-3$\times$3-1.1k-seg, and dOCTA-6$\times$6-1.1k-seg, which contains a
total number of 25,665 images. The large-scale OCTA dataset is available at

learn a classifier by augmenting the raw sparse annotations. We implement two
principles of high-quality augmentation using Generative Adversarial Networks:
1) the generated annotations should follow the distribution of authentic ones,
which is measured by a discriminator; 2) the generated annotations should have
high mutual information with the ground-truth labels, which is measured by an
auxiliary network. Extensive experiments and comparisons against an array of
state-of-the-art learning from crowds methods on three real-world datasets
proved the effectiveness of our data augmentation framework. It shows the

multi-label classification problem. The proposed approach leverages Transformer
decoders to query the existence of a class label. The use of Transformer is
rooted in the need of extracting local discriminative features adaptively for
different labels, which is a strongly desired property due to the existence of
multiple objects in one image. The built-in cross-attention module in the
Transformer decoder offers an effective way to use label embeddings as queries
to probe and pool class-related features from a feature map computed by a
vision backbone for subsequent binary classifications. Compared with prior
works, the new framework is simple, using standard Transformers and vision
backbones, and effective, consistently outperforming all previous works on five
multi-label classification data sets, including MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE,
and Visual Genome. Particularly, we establish $91.3\%$ mAP on MS-COCO. We hope
its compact structure, simple implementation, and superior performance serve as
a strong baseline for multi-label classification tasks and future studies. The

action recognition. To achieve this goal, state-of-the-art methods typically
employ the convolution operator and the dense interaction modules such as
non-local blocks. However, these methods cannot accurately fit the diverse
events in videos. On the one hand, the adopted convolutions are with fixed
scales, thus struggling with events of various scales. On the other hand, the
dense interaction modeling paradigm only achieves sub-optimal performance as
action-irrelevant parts bring additional noises for the final prediction. In
this paper, we propose a unified action recognition framework to investigate
the dynamic nature of video content by introducing the following designs.
First, when extracting local cues, we generate the spatial-temporal kernels of
dynamic-scale to adaptively fit the diverse events. Second, to accurately
aggregate these cues into a global video representation, we propose to mine the
interactions only among a few selected foreground objects by a Transformer,
which yields a sparse paradigm. We call the proposed framework as Event
Adaptive Network (EAN) because both key designs are adaptive to the input video
content. To exploit the short-term motions within local segments, we propose a
novel and efficient Latent Motion Code (LMC) module, further improving the
performance of the framework. Extensive experiments on several large-scale
video datasets, e.g., Something-to-Something V1&V2, Kinetics, and Diving48,
verify that our models achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performances at
low FLOPs. Codes are available at:

low-resolution images with unknown and complex degradations, they are still far

which is trained with pure synthetic data. Specifically, a high-order
degradation modeling process is introduced to better simulate complex
real-world degradations. We also consider the common ringing and overshoot
artifacts in the synthesis process. In addition, we employ a U-Net

address privacy concerns raised by large-scale dataset collection. Previous
anonymisation techniques have either significantly affected sign comprehension
or required manual, labour-intensive work.

In this paper, we formally introduce the task of Sign Language Video
Anonymisation (SLVA) as an automatic method to anonymise the visual appearance
of a sign language video whilst retaining the meaning of the original sign
language sequence. To tackle SLVA, we propose AnonySign, a novel automatic
approach for visual anonymisation of sign language data. We first extract pose
information from the source video to remove the original signer appearance. We
next generate a photo-realistic sign language video of a novel appearance from
the pose sequence, using image-to-image translation methods in a conditional
variational autoencoder framework. An approximate posterior style distribution
is learnt, which can be sampled from to synthesise novel human appearances. In
addition, we propose a novel \textit{style loss} that ensures style consistency
in the anonymised sign language videos.

We evaluate AnonySign for the SLVA task with extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments highlighting both realism and anonymity of our novel
human appearance synthesis. In addition, we formalise an anonymity perceptual
study as an evaluation criteria for the SLVA task and showcase that video
anonymisation using AnonySign retains the original sign language content.]]></summary>

worldwide. The current PCa diagnostic pathway comes at the cost of substantial
overdiagnosis, leading to unnecessary treatment and further testing.
Bi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (bp-MRI) based on apparent diffusion
coefficient maps (ADC) and T2-weighted (T2w) sequences has been proposed as a
triage test to differentiate between clinically significant (cS) and
non-clinically significant (ncS) prostate lesions. However, analysis of the
sequences relies on expertise, requires specialized training, and suffers from
inter-observer variability. Deep learning (DL) techniques hold promise in tasks
such as classification and detection. Nevertheless, they rely on large amounts
of annotated data which is not common in the medical field. In order to
palliate such issues, existing works rely on transfer learning (TL) and
ImageNet pre-training, which has been proven to be sub-optimal for the medical
imaging domain. In this paper, we present a patch-based pre-training strategy
to distinguish between cS and ncS lesions which exploit the region of interest
(ROI) of the patched source domain to efficiently train a classifier in the
full-slice target domain which does not require annotations by making use of
transfer learning (TL). We provide a comprehensive comparison between several
CNNs architectures and different settings which are presented as a baseline.
Moreover, we explore cross-domain TL which exploits both MRI modalities and
improves single modality results. Finally, we show how our approaches
outperform the standard approaches by a considerable margin]]></summary>

imaging (MRI) has been used to non-invasively evaluate detailed cardiac
structure and function. Accurate segmentation of cardiac structures from cine
MRI is a crucial step for early diagnosis and prognosis of CVD, and has been
greatly improved with convolutional neural networks (CNN). There, however, are
a number of limitations identified in CNN models, such as limited
interpretability and high complexity, thus limiting their use in clinical
practice. In this work, to address the limitations, we propose a lightweight
and interpretable machine learning model, successive subspace learning with the
subspace approximation with adjusted bias (Saab) transform, for accurate and
efficient segmentation from cine MRI. Specifically, our segmentation framework
is comprised of the following steps: (1) sequential expansion of near-to-far
neighborhood at different resolutions; (2) channel-wise subspace approximation
using the Saab transform for unsupervised dimension reduction; (3) class-wise
entropy guided feature selection for supervised dimension reduction; (4)
concatenation of features and pixel-wise classification with gradient boost;
and (5) conditional random field for post-processing. Experimental results on
the ACDC 2017 segmentation database, showed that our framework performed better
than state-of-the-art U-Net models with 200$\times$ fewer parameters in
delineating the left ventricle, right ventricle, and myocardium, thus showing
its potential to be used in clinical practice.]]></summary>

access discriminative and informative features efficiently. It is utilized for
candidate classification and body joint localization in PoseDet, leading to

integral part of media production. The richness of information available in LFs
has enabled novel applications like post-capture depth-of-field editing, 3D
reconstruction, segmentation and matting, saliency detection, object detection
and recognition, and mixed reality. The efficacy of such applications depends
on certain underlying requirements, which are often ignored. For example, some
operations such as noise-reduction, or hyperfan-filtering are only possible if
a scene point Lambertian radiator. Some other operations such as the removal of
obstacles or looking behind objects are only possible if there is at least one
ray capturing the required scene point. Consequently, the ray distribution
representing a certain scene point is an important characteristic for
evaluating processing possibilities. The primary idea in this paper is to
establish a relation between the capturing setup and the rays of the LF. To
this end, we discretize the view frustum. Traditionally, a uniform
discretization of the view frustum results in voxels that represents a single
sample on a regularly spaced, 3-D grid. Instead, we use frustum-shaped voxels
(froxels), by using depth and capturing-setup dependent discretization of the
view frustum. Based on such discretization, we count the number of rays mapping
to the same pixel on the capturing device(s). By means of this count, we
propose histograms of ray-counts over the froxels (fristograms). Fristograms
can be used as a tool to analyze and reveal interesting aspects of the
underlying LF, like the number of rays originating from a scene point and the
color distribution of these rays. As an example, we show its ability by
significantly reducing the number of rays which enables noise reduction while
maintaining the realistic rendering of non-Lambertian or partially occluded
regions.]]></summary>

anti-spoofing studies excavate the hidden cues in original images to
discriminate real persons and diverse attack types with the assistance of
auxiliary supervision. However, limited by the following two inherent
disturbances in their training process: 1) Complete facial structure in a
single image. 2) Implicit subdomains in the whole dataset, these methods are
prone to stick on memorization of the entire training dataset and show
sensitivity to nonhomologous domain distribution. In this paper, we propose
Structure Destruction Module and Content Combination Module to address these
two imitations separately. The former mechanism destroys images into patches to
construct a non-structural input, while the latter mechanism recombines patches
from different subdomains or classes into a mixup construct. Based on this
splitting-and-splicing operation, Local Relation Modeling Module is further
proposed to model the second-order relationship between patches. We evaluate
our method on extensive public datasets and promising experimental results to

latent space of an autoencoder (AE). Even though this produces convincing
results, it has two major shortcomings. As the GAN is limited to reproduce the
dataset the AE was trained on, we cannot reuse a trained AE for novel data.
Furthermore, it is difficult to add spatial supervision into the generation
process, as the AE only gives us a global representation. To remedy these
issues, we propose to train the GAN on grids (i.e. each cell covers a part of a
shape). In this representation each cell is equipped with a latent vector
provided by an AE. This localized representation enables more expressiveness
(since the cell-based latent vectors can be combined in novel ways) as well as
spatial control of the generation process (e.g. via bounding boxes). Our method
outperforms the current state of the art on all established evaluation
measures, proposed for quantitatively evaluating the generative capabilities of
GANs. We show limitations of these measures and propose the adaptation of a
robust criterion from statistical analysis as an alternative.]]></summary>

inefficient operations with more efficient alternatives using a neural
architecture search like approach. HANT tackles the problem in two phase: In
the first phase, a large number of alternative operations per every layer of
the teacher model is trained using layer-wise feature map distillation. In the
second phase, the combinatorial selection of efficient operations is relaxed to
an integer optimization problem that can be solved in a few seconds. We extend
HANT with kernel fusion and quantization to improve throughput even further.
Our experimental results on accelerating the EfficientNet family show that HANT
can accelerate them by up to 3.6x with <0.4% drop in the top-1 accuracy on the
ImageNet dataset. When comparing the same latency level, HANT can accelerate
EfficientNet-B4 to the same latency as EfficientNet-B1 while having 3% higher
accuracy. We examine a large pool of operations, up to 197 per layer, and we
provide insights into the selected operations and final architectures.]]></summary>

observations, is a central building block of artificial general intelligence.
While humans find the answer by either eliminating wrong candidates or first
constructing the answer, prior deep neural network (DNN)-based methods focus on
the former discriminative approach. This paper aims to design a framework for
the latter approach and bridge the gap between artificial and human
intelligence. To this end, we propose logic-guided generation (LoGe), a novel
generative DNN framework that reduces abstract reasoning as an optimization
problem in propositional logic. LoGe is composed of three steps: extract
propositional variables from images, reason the answer variables with a logic
layer, and reconstruct the answer image from the variables. We demonstrate that
LoGe outperforms the black box DNN frameworks for generative abstract reasoning
under the RAVEN benchmark, i.e., reconstructing answers based on capturing

analysis in forward-looking-sonar (FLS) imagery. Our framework relies on first
removing non-discriminative details from the imagery using a small-scale
DenseNet-inspired network. Doing so simplifies ensuing analyses and permits
generalizing from few labeled examples. We then cascade the filtered imagery
into a novel NeuralRAM-based convolutional matching network, NRMN, for low-shot
target recognition. We employ a small-scale FlowNet, LFN to align and register
FLS imagery across local temporal scales. LFN enables target label consensus
voting across images and generally improves target detection and recognition
rates.

We evaluate our framework using real-world FLS imagery with multiple broad
target classes that have high intra-class variability and rich sub-class
structure. We show that few-shot learning, with anywhere from ten to thirty
class-specific exemplars, performs similarly to supervised deep networks
trained on hundreds of samples per class. Effective zero-shot learning is also
possible. High performance is realized from the inductive-transfer properties
of NRMNs when distractor elements are removed.]]></summary>

information by fusing feature maps of four different spatial sizes, \ie $1/4$,
$1/8$, $1/16$, and $1/32$ of the input image. There are two drawbacks of this
strategy: 1) feature maps of different spatial sizes may be not well aligned
spatially, which potentially hurts the accuracy of keypoint location; 2) these
scales are fixed and inflexible, which may restrict the generalization ability
over various human sizes. Towards these issues, we propose an adaptive dilated
convolution (ADC). It can generate and fuse multi-scale features of the same
spatial sizes by setting different dilation rates for different channels. More
importantly, these dilation rates are generated by a regression module. It
enables ADC to adaptively adjust the fused scales and thus ADC may generalize
better to various human sizes. ADC can be end-to-end trained and easily plugged
into existing methods. Extensive experiments show that ADC can bring consistent
improvements to various HPE methods. The source codes will be released for

unsupervised visual representation learning by maximizing the similarity
between two augmented views of the same image (positive pairs) and
simultaneously contrasting other different images (negative pairs). However,
this type of methods, such as SimCLR and MoCo, relies heavily on a large number
of negative pairs and thus requires either large batches or memory banks. In
contrast, some recent non-contrastive SSL methods, such as BYOL and SimSiam,
attempt to discard negative pairs by introducing asymmetry and show remarkable
performance. Unfortunately, to avoid collapsed solutions caused by not using
negative pairs, these methods require sophisticated asymmetry designs. In this
paper, we argue that negative pairs are still necessary but one is sufficient,
i.e., triplet is all you need. A simple triplet-based loss can achieve
surprisingly good performance without requiring large batches or asymmetry.
Moreover, we observe that unsupervised visual representation learning can gain
significantly from randomness. Based on this observation, we propose a simple
plug-in RandOm MApping (ROMA) strategy by randomly mapping samples into other
spaces and enforcing these randomly projected samples to satisfy the same
correlation requirement. The proposed ROMA strategy not only achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in conjunction with the triplet-based loss, but
also can further effectively boost other SSL methods.]]></summary>

(NLP) inspired Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) skeletal key-point estimator
using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar data. To the best of the author's
knowledge, this is the first method to precisely estimate upto 25 skeletal
key-points using mmWave radar data alone. Skeletal pose estimation is critical
in several applications ranging from autonomous vehicles, traffic monitoring,
patient monitoring, gait analysis, to defense security forensics, and aid both
preventative and actionable decision making. The use of mmWave radars for this
task, over traditionally employed optical sensors, provide several advantages,
primarily its operational robustness to scene lighting and adverse weather
conditions, where optical sensor performance degrade significantly. The mmWave
radar point-cloud (PCL) data is first voxelized (analogous to tokenization in
NLP) and $N$ frames of the voxelized radar data (analogous to a text paragraph
in NLP) is subjected to the proposed mmPose-NLP architecture, where the voxel
indices of the 25 skeletal key-points (analogous to keyword extraction in NLP)
are predicted. The voxel indices are converted back to real world 3-D
coordinates using the voxel dictionary used during the tokenization process.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics were used to measure the accuracy of the
proposed system against the ground truth, with the proposed mmPose-NLP offering
<3 cm localization errors in the depth, horizontal and vertical axes. The
effect of the number of input frames vs performance/accuracy was also studied
for N = {1,2,..,10}. A comprehensive methodology, results, discussions and
limitations are presented in this paper. All the source codes and results are

models often perform poorly on tasks that require causal reasoning, which is
often derived using some form of commonsense knowledge not immediately
available in the input but implicitly inferred by humans. Prior work has
unraveled spurious observational biases that models fall prey to in the absence
of causality. While language representation models preserve contextual
knowledge within learned embeddings, they do not factor in causal relationships
during training. By blending causal relationships with the input features to an
existing model that performs visual cognition tasks (such as scene
understanding, video captioning, video question-answering, etc.), better
performance can be achieved owing to the insight causal relationships bring
about. Recently, several models have been proposed that have tackled the task
of mining causal data from either the visual or textual modality. However,
there does not exist widespread research that mines causal relationships by
juxtaposing the visual and language modalities. While images offer a rich and
easy-to-process resource for us to mine causality knowledge from, videos are
denser and consist of naturally time-ordered events. Also, textual information
offers details that could be implicit in videos. We propose iReason, a
framework that infers visual-semantic commonsense knowledge using both videos
and natural language captions. Furthermore, iReason's architecture integrates a
causal rationalization module to aid the process of interpretability, error
analysis and bias detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of iReason using
a two-pronged comparative analysis with language representation learning models

either carried out by vacating room before or after data encryption, which
leads to a separation of the search field in RDHEI. Besides, high capacity
relies heavily on vacating room before encryption (VRBE), which significantly
lowers the payload of vacating room after encryption (VRAE) based schemes. To
address this issue, this paper proposes a framework for high-capacity RDHEI for
both VRBE and VRAE cases using pixel predictions and entropy encoding. We
propose an embedding room generation algorithm to produce vacated room by
generating the prediction-error histogram (PEH) of the selected cover using
adjacency prediction and the median edge detector (MED). In the VRBE scenario,
we propose a scheme that generates the embedding room using the proposed
algorithm, and encrypts the preprocessed image by using the stream cipher with
two encryption keys. In the VRAE scenario, we propose a scheme that involves an
improved block modulation and permutation encryption algorithm where the
spatial redundancy in the plain-text image can be largely preserved. Then the
proposed algorithm is applied on the encrypted image to generate the embedding
room. At the data hider's side of both the schemes, the data hider locates the
embedding room and embeds the encrypted additional data. On receiving the
marked encrypted image, the receivers with different authentication can
respectively conduct error-free data extraction and/or error-free image
recovery. The experimental results show that the two schemes in the proposed
framework can outperform many previous state-of-the-art RDHEI arts. Besides,
the proposed schemes can ensure high information security in that little detail
of the original image can be directly discovered from the encrypted images or
the marked encrypted images.]]></summary>

perform multi-target tracking (MOT) in real-time on low-end devices. Today's
MOT solutions employ deep neural networks, which tend to have high computation
complexity. Recognizing the effects of frame sizes on tracking performance, we
propose DeepScale, a model agnostic frame size selection approach that operates
on top of existing fully convolutional network-based trackers to accelerate
tracking throughput. In the training stage, we incorporate detectability scores
into a one-shot tracker architecture so that DeepScale can learn representation
estimations for different frame sizes in a self-supervised manner. During
inference, based on user-controlled parameters, it can find a suitable
trade-off between tracking accuracy and speed by adapting frame sizes at run

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: In medical imaging, prior studies have demonstrated disparate AI
performance by race, yet there is no known correlation for race on medical
imaging that would be obvious to the human expert interpreting the images.

Methods: Using private and public datasets we evaluate: A) performance
quantification of deep learning models to detect race from medical images,
including the ability of these models to generalize to external environments
and across multiple imaging modalities, B) assessment of possible confounding
anatomic and phenotype population features, such as disease distribution and
body habitus as predictors of race, and C) investigation into the underlying
mechanism by which AI models can recognize race.

Findings: Standard deep learning models can be trained to predict race from
medical images with high performance across multiple imaging modalities. Our
findings hold under external validation conditions, as well as when models are
optimized to perform clinically motivated tasks. We demonstrate this detection
is not due to trivial proxies or imaging-related surrogate covariates for race,
such as underlying disease distribution. Finally, we show that performance
persists over all anatomical regions and frequency spectrum of the images
suggesting that mitigation efforts will be challenging and demand further
study.

Interpretation: We emphasize that model ability to predict self-reported race
is itself not the issue of importance. However, our findings that AI can
trivially predict self-reported race -- even from corrupted, cropped, and
noised medical images -- in a setting where clinical experts cannot, creates an
enormous risk for all model deployments in medical imaging: if an AI model
secretly used its knowledge of self-reported race to misclassify all Black
patients, radiologists would not be able to tell using the same data the model
has access to.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many RGB-T trackers attempt to attain robust feature representation by
utilizing an adaptive weighting scheme (or attention mechanism). Different from
these works, we propose a new dynamic modality-aware filter generation module
(named MFGNet) to boost the message communication between visible and thermal
data by adaptively adjusting the convolutional kernels for various input images
in practical tracking. Given the image pairs as input, we first encode their
features with the backbone network. Then, we concatenate these feature maps and
generate dynamic modality-aware filters with two independent networks. The
visible and thermal filters will be used to conduct a dynamic convolutional
operation on their corresponding input feature maps respectively. Inspired by
residual connection, both the generated visible and thermal feature maps will
be summarized with input feature maps. The augmented feature maps will be fed
into the RoI align module to generate instance-level features for subsequent
classification. To address issues caused by heavy occlusion, fast motion, and
out-of-view, we propose to conduct a joint local and global search by
exploiting a new direction-aware target-driven attention mechanism. The spatial
and temporal recurrent neural network is used to capture the direction-aware
context for accurate global attention prediction. Extensive experiments on
three large-scale RGB-T tracking benchmark datasets validated the effectiveness
of our proposed algorithm. The project page of this paper is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video moment retrieval targets at retrieving a moment in a video for a given
language query. The challenges of this task include 1) the requirement of
localizing the relevant moment in an untrimmed video, and 2) bridging the
semantic gap between textual query and video contents. To tackle those
problems, early approaches adopt the sliding window or uniform sampling to
collect video clips first and then match each clip with the query. Obviously,
these strategies are time-consuming and often lead to unsatisfied accuracy in
localization due to the unpredictable length of the golden moment. To avoid the
limitations, researchers recently attempt to directly predict the relevant
moment boundaries without the requirement to generate video clips first. One
mainstream approach is to generate a multimodal feature vector for the target
query and video frames (e.g., concatenation) and then use a regression approach
upon the multimodal feature vector for boundary detection. Although some
progress has been achieved by this approach, we argue that those methods have
not well captured the cross-modal interactions between the query and video
frames.

In this paper, we propose an Attentive Cross-modal Relevance Matching (ACRM)
model which predicts the temporal boundaries based on an interaction modeling.
In addition, an attention module is introduced to assign higher weights to
query words with richer semantic cues, which are considered to be more
important for finding relevant video contents. Another contribution is that we
propose an additional predictor to utilize the internal frames in the model
training to improve the localization accuracy. Extensive experiments on two
datasets TACoS and Charades-STA demonstrate the superiority of our method over
several state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies have been also conducted to
examine the effectiveness of different modules in our ACRM model.]]></summary>

models often perform poorly on tasks that require causal reasoning, which is
often derived using some form of commonsense knowledge not immediately
available in the input but implicitly inferred by humans. Prior work has
unraveled spurious observational biases that models fall prey to in the absence
of causality. While language representation models preserve contextual
knowledge within learned embeddings, they do not factor in causal relationships
during training. By blending causal relationships with the input features to an
existing model that performs visual cognition tasks (such as scene
understanding, video captioning, video question-answering, etc.), better
performance can be achieved owing to the insight causal relationships bring
about. Recently, several models have been proposed that have tackled the task
of mining causal data from either the visual or textual modality. However,
there does not exist widespread research that mines causal relationships by
juxtaposing the visual and language modalities. While images offer a rich and
easy-to-process resource for us to mine causality knowledge from, videos are
denser and consist of naturally time-ordered events. Also, textual information
offers details that could be implicit in videos. We propose iReason, a
framework that infers visual-semantic commonsense knowledge using both videos
and natural language captions. Furthermore, iReason's architecture integrates a
causal rationalization module to aid the process of interpretability, error
analysis and bias detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of iReason using
a two-pronged comparative analysis with language representation learning models
(BERT, GPT-2) as well as current state-of-the-art multimodal causality models.]]></summary>

has been published at a dazzling pace, which makes it hard to follow the
research in this area without dedicated efforts. It is practically impossible
to implement this task manually due to the high volume of the relevant
literature. Text mining has been considered to be a powerful approach to
address this challenge, especially the topic modeling, a well-known
unsupervised method that aims to reveal latent topics from the literature.
However, in spite of its potential utility, the results generated from this
approach are often investigated manually. Hence, its application to the
COVID-19 literature is not straightforward and expert knowledge is needed to
make meaningful interpretations. In order to address these challenges, we
propose a novel analytical framework for estimating topic interactions and
effective visualization for topic interpretation. Here we assumed that topics
constituting a paper can be positioned on an interaction map, which belongs to
a high-dimensional Euclidean space. Based on this assumption, after summarizing
topics with their topic-word distributions using the biterm topic model, we
mapped these latent topics on networks to visualize relationships among the
topics. Moreover, in the proposed approach, the change of relationships among
topics can be traced using a trajectory plot generated with different levels of
word richness. These results together provide deeply mined and intuitive
representation of relationships among topics related to a specific research
area. The application of this proposed framework to the PubMed literature shows
that our approach facilitates understanding of the topics constituting the

corpus created on-demand by human experts, which is neither timely nor

generating prose that may be responsive to an information need, but at present
they are dilettantes rather than domain experts -- they do not have a true
understanding of the world, they are prone to hallucinating, and crucially they
are incapable of justifying their utterances by referring to supporting
documents in the corpus they were trained over. This paper examines how ideas

information strategically to steer its receiver's decision towards a desired
choice. Traditionally, such frameworks have always assumed that the sender and
the receiver comprehends the state of the choice environment, and that the
receiver always trusts the sender's signal. This paper deviates from these
assumptions and re-investigates strategic information design in the presence of
distrustful receiver and when both sender and receiver cannot
observe/comprehend the environment state space. Specifically, we assume that
both sender and receiver has access to non-identical beliefs about choice
rewards (with sender's belief being more accurate), but not the environment
state that determines these rewards. Furthermore, given that the receiver does
not trust the sender, we also assume that the receiver updates its prior in a
non-Bayesian manner. We evaluate the Stackelberg equilibrium and investigate
effects of information framing (i.e. send complete signal, or just expected
value of the signal) on the equilibrium. Furthermore, we also investigate trust
dynamics at the receiver, under the assumption that the receiver minimizes
regret in hindsight. Simulation results are presented to illustrate signaling
effects and trust dynamics in strategic information design.]]></summary>

GOAT adopts the primitive attacks' paradigm that assigns items for fake users
by sampling and the upgraded attacks' paradigm that generates fake ratings by a
deep learning-based model. It deploys a generative adversarial network (GAN)
that learns the real rating distribution to generate fake ratings.
Additionally, the generator combines a tailored graph convolution structure
that leverages the correlations between co-rated items to smoothen the fake
ratings and enhance their authenticity. The extensive experiments on two public
datasets evaluate GOAT's performance from multiple perspectives. Our study of
the GOAT demonstrates technical feasibility for building a more powerful and
intelligent attack model with a much-reduced cost, enables analysis the threat
of such an attack and guides for investigating necessary prevention measures.]]></summary>

training. Collecting this data at scale inevitably causes label noise.Hence,the
need to develop learning algorithms that are robust to label noise. In recent
years, k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) emerged as a viable solution to this problem.
Despite its success, kNN is not without its problems. Mainly, it requires a
huge memory footprint to store all the training samples and it needs an
advanced data structure to allow for fast retrieval of the relevant examples,
given a query sample. We propose a neural network, termed kNet, that learns to
perform kNN. Once trained, we no longer need to store the training data, and
processing a query sample is a simple matter of inference. To use kNet, we
first train a preliminary network on the data set, and then train kNet on the
penultimate layer of the preliminary network.We find that kNet gives a smooth
approximation of kNN,and cannot handle the sharp label changes between samples
that kNN can exhibit. This indicates that currently kNet is best suited to
approximate kNN with a fairly large k. Experiments on two data sets show that
this is the regime in which kNN works best,and can therefore be replaced by
kNet.In practice, kNet consistently improve the results of all preliminary
networks, in all label noise regimes, by up to 3%.]]></summary>

has become an increasingly important area of research. At the same time,
network regularization has been recognized as a crucial dimension to effective
training of DNNs. However, the role of metalearning in establishing effective
regularization has not yet been fully explored. There is recent evidence that
loss-function optimization could play this role, however it is computationally
impractical as an outer loop to full training. This paper presents an algorithm
called Evolutionary Population-Based Training (EPBT) that interleaves the
training of a DNN's weights with the metalearning of loss functions. They are
parameterized using multivariate Taylor expansions that EPBT can directly
optimize. Such simultaneous adaptation of weights and loss functions can be
deceptive, and therefore EPBT uses a quality-diversity heuristic called Novelty
Pulsation as well as knowledge distillation to prevent overfitting during
training. On the CIFAR-10 and SVHN image classification benchmarks, EPBT
results in faster, more accurate learning. The discovered hyperparameters adapt
to the training process and serve to regularize the learning task by
discouraging overfitting to the labels. EPBT thus demonstrates a practical
instantiation of regularization metalearning based on simultaneous training.]]></summary>

a set of processes and tools allow humans to better comprehend the decisions
generated by black box models. However, most of the available XAI tools are
often limited to simple explanations mainly quantifying the impact of
individual features to the models' output. Therefore, human users are not able
to understand how the features are related to each other to make predictions,
whereas the inner workings of the trained models remain hidden. This paper
contributes to the development of a novel graphical explainability tool that
not only indicates the significant features of the model but also reveals the
conditional relationships between features and the inference capturing both the
direct and indirect impact of features to the models' decision. The proposed
XAI methodology, termed as gLIME, provides graphical model-agnostic
explanations either at the global (for the entire dataset) or the local scale
(for specific data points). It relies on a combination of local interpretable
model-agnostic explanations (LIME) with graphical least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (GLASSO) producing undirected Gaussian graphical models.
Regularization is adopted to shrink small partial correlation coefficients to
zero providing sparser and more interpretable graphical explanations. Two
well-known classification datasets (BIOPSY and OAI) were selected to confirm
the superiority of gLIME over LIME in terms of both robustness and consistency
over multiple permutations. Specifically, gLIME accomplished increased
stability over the two datasets with respect to features' importance (76%-96%
compared to 52%-77% using LIME). gLIME demonstrates a unique potential to
extend the functionality of the current state-of-the-art in XAI by providing
informative graphically given explanations that could unlock black boxes.]]></summary>

effective tools for marginal likelihood estimation, but are not fully
differentiable due to the use of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) correction steps.
Differentiability is a desirable property as it would admit the possibility of
optimizing marginal likelihood as an objective using gradient-based methods. To
this end, we propose a differentiable AIS algorithm by abandoning MH steps,
which further unlocks mini-batch computation. We provide a detailed convergence
analysis for Bayesian linear regression which goes beyond previous analyses by
explicitly accounting for non-perfect transitions. Using this analysis, we
prove that our algorithm is consistent in the full-batch setting and provide a
sublinear convergence rate. However, we show that the algorithm is inconsistent
when mini-batch gradients are used due to a fundamental incompatibility between
the goals of last-iterate convergence to the posterior and elimination of the
pathwise stochastic error. This result is in stark contrast to our experience
with stochastic optimization and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, where
the effects of gradient noise can be washed out by taking more steps of a
smaller size. Our negative result relies crucially on our explicit
consideration of convergence to the stationary distribution, and it helps
explain the difficulty of developing practically effective AIS-like algorithms
that exploit mini-batch gradients.]]></summary>

dynamical isometry and speeding up training. The increase in learning speed
that results from orthogonal initialization in linear networks has been
well-proven. However, while the same is believed to also hold for nonlinear
networks when the dynamical isometry condition is satisfied, the training
dynamics behind this contention have not been thoroughly explored. In this
work, we study the dynamics of ultra-wide networks across a range of
architectures, including Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) and Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) with orthogonal initialization via neural tangent kernel
(NTK). Through a series of propositions and lemmas, we prove that two NTKs, one
corresponding to Gaussian weights and one to orthogonal weights, are equal when
the network width is infinite. Further, during training, the NTK of an
orthogonally-initialized infinite-width network should theoretically remain
constant. This suggests that the orthogonal initialization cannot speed up
training in the NTK (lazy training) regime, contrary to the prevailing
thoughts. In order to explore under what circumstances can orthogonality
accelerate training, we conduct a thorough empirical investigation outside the
NTK regime. We find that when the hyper-parameters are set to achieve a linear
regime in nonlinear activation, orthogonal initialization can improve the
learning speed with a large learning rate or large depth.]]></summary>

information for secondary uses, such as clinical events prediction or chronic
disease management. However, challenges exist for temporal data representation.
We therefore sought to identify these challenges and evaluate novel
methodologies for addressing them through a systematic examination of deep
learning solutions.

Methods: We searched five databases (PubMed, EMBASE, the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers [IEEE] Xplore Digital Library, the
Association for Computing Machinery [ACM] digital library, and Web of Science)
complemented with hand-searching in several prestigious computer science
conference proceedings. We sought articles that reported deep learning
methodologies on temporal data representation in structured EHR data from
January 1, 2010, to August 30, 2020. We summarized and analyzed the selected
articles from three perspectives: nature of time series, methodology, and model
implementation.

Results: We included 98 articles related to temporal data representation
using deep learning. Four major challenges were identified, including data
irregularity, data heterogeneity, data sparsity, and model opacity. We then
studied how deep learning techniques were applied to address these challenges.
Finally, we discuss some open challenges arising from deep learning.

Conclusion: Temporal EHR data present several major challenges for clinical
prediction modeling and data utilization. To some extent, current deep learning
solutions can address these challenges. Future studies can consider designing
comprehensive and integrated solutions. Moreover, researchers should
incorporate additional clinical domain knowledge into study designs and enhance
the interpretability of the model to facilitate its implementation in clinical
practice.]]></summary>

key enabler to the automation of data-led decision making. As an important
branch of state-of-the-art data analytics, business process predictions are
also faced with a challenge in regard to the lack of explanation to the
reasoning and decision by the underlying `black-box' prediction models. With
the development of interpretable machine learning techniques, explanations can
be generated for a black-box model, making it possible for (human) users to
access the reasoning behind machine learned predictions. In this paper, we aim
to present an approach that allows us to use model explanations to investigate
certain reasoning applied by machine learned predictions and detect potential
issues with the underlying methods thus enhancing trust in business process
prediction models. A novel contribution of our approach is the proposal of
model inspection that leverages both the explanations generated by
interpretable machine learning mechanisms and the contextual or domain
knowledge extracted from event logs that record historical process execution.
Findings drawn from this work are expected to serve as a key input to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sideslip angle is an important variable for understanding and monitoring
vehicle dynamics but it lacks an inexpensive method for direct measurement.
Therefore, it is typically estimated from inertial and other proprioceptive
sensors onboard using filtering methods from the family of the Kalman Filter.
As a novel alternative, this work proposes modelling the problem directly as a
graphical model (factor graph), which can then be optimized using a variety of
methods, such as whole dataset batch optimization for offline processing or
fixed-lag smoother for on-line operation. Experimental results on real vehicle
datasets validate the proposal with a good agreement between estimated and
actual sideslip angle, showing similar performance than the state-of-the-art
with a great potential for future extensions due to the flexible mathematical
framework.]]></summary>

and momentum where there is a need to draw insights from data while preserving
the data provider's privacy. However, one among other existing challenges in
the adoption of federated learning has been the lack of fair, transparent and
universally agreed incentivization schemes for rewarding the federated learning
contributors. Smart contracts on a blockchain network provide transparent,
immutable and independently verifiable proofs by all participants of the
network. We leverage this open and transparent nature of smart contracts on a
blockchain to define incentivization rules for the contributors, which is based
on a novel scalar quantity - federated contribution. Such a smart contract
based reward-driven model has the potential to revolutionize the federated
learning adoption in enterprises. Our contribution is two-fold: first is to
show how smart contract based blockchain can be a very natural communication
channel for federated learning. Second, leveraging this infrastructure, we can
show how an intuitive measure of each agents' contribution can be built and
integrated with the life cycle of the training and reward process.]]></summary>

of data and labels, and thus realize conditional generation. Among them,
auxiliary classifier generative adversarial networks (AC-GAN) have been widely
used, but suffer from the issue of low intra-class diversity on generated
samples. In this paper, we point out that the fundamental reason is that the
classifier of AC-GAN is generator-agnostic, and thus cannot provide informative
guidance to the generator to approximate the target joint distribution, leading
to a minimization of conditional entropy that decreases the intra-class
diversity. Based on this finding, we propose novel cGANs with auxiliary
discriminative classifier (ADC-GAN) to address the issue of AC-GAN.
Specifically, the auxiliary discriminative classifier becomes generator-aware
by distinguishing between the real and fake data while recognizing their
labels. We then optimize the generator based on the auxiliary classifier along
with the original discriminator to match the joint and marginal distributions
of the generated samples with those of the real samples. We provide theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence on synthetic and real-world datasets to
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ADC-GAN compared to competitive

critical domains, it remains an open question how human-AI teams can reliably
outperform AI alone and human alone in challenging prediction tasks (also known
as complementary performance). We explore two directions to understand the gaps
in achieving complementary performance. First, we argue that the typical
experimental setup limits the potential of human-AI teams. To account for lower
AI performance out-of-distribution than in-distribution because of distribution
shift, we design experiments with different distribution types and investigate
human performance for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution examples.
Second, we develop novel interfaces to support interactive explanations so that
humans can actively engage with AI assistance. Using virtual pilot studies and
large-scale randomized experiments across three tasks, we demonstrate a clear
difference between in-distribution and out-of-distribution, and observe mixed
results for interactive explanations: while interactive explanations improve
human perception of AI assistance's usefulness, they may reinforce human biases
and lead to limited performance improvement. Overall, our work points out
critical challenges and future directions towards enhancing human performance

Self-Supervised Selective Self-Training (S4T), a source-free adaptation

diverse views of each target image along with model confidence to classify
pixel predictions as either reliable or unreliable. Next, the model is
self-trained, using predicted pseudolabels for reliable predictions and
pseudolabels inferred via a selective interpolation strategy for unreliable
ones. S4T matches or improves upon the state-of-the-art in source-free

Interaction among agents would bring benefits, including reducing operating

important challenge in various applications. These challenges include the
effect of search space size on learning time, inefficient cooperation among
agents, and the lack of proper coordination among agents' decisions. Moreover,
reinforcement learning algorithms may suffer from long convergence time in
these problems. In this paper, a communication framework using knowledge
transfer concepts is introduced to address such challenges in the herding
problem with large state space. To handle the problems of convergence,
knowledge transfer has been utilized that can significantly increase the
efficiency of reinforcement learning algorithms. Coordination between the

alternative to NNs (Aitchison et al. 2020). Deep kernel processes flexibly
learn good top-layer representations by alternately sampling the kernel from a
distribution over positive semi-definite matrices and performing nonlinear
transformations. A particular deep kernel process, the deep Wishart process
(DWP), is of particular interest because its prior is equivalent to deep
Gaussian process (DGP) priors. However, inference in DWPs has not yet been
possible due to the lack of sufficiently flexible distributions over positive
semi-definite matrices. Here, we give a novel approach to obtaining flexible
distributions over positive semi-definite matrices by generalising the Bartlett
decomposition of the Wishart probability density. We use this new distribution
to develop an approximate posterior for the DWP that includes dependency across
layers. We develop a doubly-stochastic inducing-point inference scheme for the
DWP and show experimentally that inference in the DWP gives improved
performance over doing inference in a DGP with the equivalent prior.]]></summary>

influential in recent years, showing good performance in several tasks as they
efficiently transform a graph into a more computationally digestible format
while preserving relevant information. However, the theoretical properties of
such algorithms, in particular the influence of hyperparameters and of the
graph structure on their convergence behaviour, have so far not been
well-understood. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis for
random-walks based embeddings techniques. Firstly, we prove that, under some
weak assumptions, vertex embeddings derived from random walks do indeed
converge both in the single limit of the number of random walks $N \to \infty$
and in the double limit of both $N$ and the length of each random walk
$L\to\infty$. Secondly, we derive concentration bounds quantifying the converge
rate of the corpora for the single and double limits. Thirdly, we use these
results to derive a heuristic for choosing the hyperparameters $N$ and $L$. We
validate and illustrate the practical importance of our findings with a range
of numerical and visual experiments on several graphs drawn from real-world

non-compliance by the participants. While much of the existing work has studied
compliance as a static behavior, we propose a game-theoretic model to study
compliance as dynamic behavior that may change over time. In rounds, a social
planner interacts with a sequence of heterogeneous agents who arrive with their
unobserved private type that determines both their prior preferences across the
actions (e.g., control and treatment) and their baseline rewards without taking
any treatment. The planner provides each agent with a randomized recommendation
that may alter their beliefs and their action selection. We develop a novel
recommendation mechanism that views the planner's recommendation as a form of
instrumental variable (IV) that only affects an agents' action selection, but
not the observed rewards. We construct such IVs by carefully mapping the
history -- the interactions between the planner and the previous agents -- to a
random recommendation. Even though the initial agents may be completely
non-compliant, our mechanism can incentivize compliance over time, thereby
enabling the estimation of the treatment effect of each treatment, and
minimizing the cumulative regret of the planner whose goal is to identify the
optimal treatment.]]></summary>

from natural examples, pose a serious threat to learning models. Defending
against adversarial attacks is a critical element for a reliable learning
system. Support vector machine (SVM) is a classical yet still important
learning algorithm even in the current deep learning era. Although a wide range
of researches have been done in recent years to improve the adversarial
robustness of learning models, but most of them are limited to deep neural
networks (DNNs) and the work for kernel SVM is still vacant. In this paper, we
aim at kernel SVM and propose adv-SVM to improve its adversarial robustness via
adversarial training, which has been demonstrated to be the most promising
defense techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
devotes to the fast and scalable adversarial training of kernel SVM.
Specifically, we first build connection of perturbations of samples between
original and kernel spaces, and then give a reduced and equivalent formulation
of adversarial training of kernel SVM based on the connection. Next, doubly
stochastic gradients (DSG) based on two unbiased stochastic approximations
(i.e., one is on training points and another is on random features) are applied
to update the solution of our objective function. Finally, we prove that our
algorithm optimized by DSG converges to the optimal solution at the rate of
O(1/t) under the constant and diminishing stepsizes. Comprehensive experimental
results show that our adversarial training algorithm enjoys robustness against
various attacks and meanwhile has the similar efficiency and scalability with
classical DSG algorithm.]]></summary>

threats brought by deep learning models to data security and privacy,
especially in the field of domain adaptation. Existing unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods can achieve promising performance without transferring
data from source domain to target domain. However, UDA with representation
alignment or self-supervised pseudo-labeling relies on the transferred source
models. In many data-critical scenarios, methods based on model transferring
may suffer from membership inference attacks and expose private data. In this
paper, we aim to overcome a challenging new setting where the source models are
only queryable but cannot be transferred to the target domain. We propose
Black-box Probe Domain Adaptation (BPDA), which adopts query mechanism to probe
and refine information from source model using third-party dataset. In order to
gain more informative query results, we further propose Distributionally
Adversarial Training (DAT) to align the distribution of third-party data with
that of target data. BPDA uses public third-party dataset and adversarial
examples based on DAT as the information carrier between source and target
domains, dispensing with transferring source data or model. Experimental
results on benchmarks of Digit-Five, Office-Caltech, Office-31, Office-Home,

Our method performs well on unseen data, and is faster than previous methods

probability distribution over assignments, which, together with an existing MIP

steps as a Markov Decision Process, we train a Neural Neighborhood Selection
policy to select a search neighborhood at each step, which is searched using a
MIP solver to find the next assignment. The policy network is trained using
imitation learning. We propose a target policy for imitation that, given enough
compute resources, is guaranteed to select the neighborhood containing the
optimal next assignment across all possible choices for the neighborhood of a
specified size. Our approach matches or outperforms all the baselines on five

Reinforcement Learning methodologies and the problem of exploration/coverage of
unknown terrains. Within this scope, MarsExplorer, an openai-gym compatible
environment tailored to exploration/coverage of unknown areas, is presented.
MarsExplorer translates the original robotics problem into a Reinforcement
Learning setup that various off-the-shelf algorithms can tackle. Any learned
policy can be straightforwardly applied to a robotic platform without an
elaborate simulation model of the robot's dynamics to apply a different
learning/adaptation phase. One of its core features is the controllable
multi-dimensional procedural generation of terrains, which is the key for
producing policies with strong generalization capabilities. Four different
state-of-the-art RL algorithms (A3C, PPO, Rainbow, and SAC) are trained on the
MarsExplorer environment, and a proper evaluation of their results compared to
the average human-level performance is reported. In the follow-up experimental
analysis, the effect of the multi-dimensional difficulty setting on the
learning capabilities of the best-performing algorithm (PPO) is analyzed. A
milestone result is the generation of an exploration policy that follows the
Hilbert curve without providing this information to the environment or
rewarding directly or indirectly Hilbert-curve-like trajectories. The
experimental analysis is concluded by comparing PPO learned policy results with
frontier-based exploration context for extended terrain sizes. The source code

general scheme of prior methods is to optimize two-view representations of
input graphs. In many studies, a single graph-level representation is computed
as one of the contrastive objectives, capturing limited characteristics of
graphs. We argue that contrasting graphs in multiple subspaces enables graph
encoders to capture more abundant characteristics. To this end, we propose a
group contrastive learning framework in this work. Our framework embeds the
given graph into multiple subspaces, of which each representation is prompted
to encode specific characteristics of graphs. To learn diverse and informative
representations, we develop principled objectives that enable us to capture the
relations among both intra-space and inter-space representations in groups.
Under the proposed framework, we further develop an attention-based representor
function to compute representations that capture different substructures of a
given graph. Built upon our framework, we extend two current methods into
GroupCL and GroupIG, equipped with the proposed objective. Comprehensive
experimental results show our framework achieves a promising boost in

formulate the task as optimizing a binary mask distribution enabling an
accurate reconstruction. We then face two main challenges. One concerns
differentiability issues due to the binary distribution. The second one
corresponds to the elimination of redundant information by selecting variables
in a correlated fashion which requires modeling the covariance of the binary
distribution. We address both issues by introducing a relaxation of the problem
via a novel reparameterization of the logitNormal distribution. We demonstrate
that the proposed method provides an effective exploration scheme and leads to

that has low computation requirement at the edge device but has the
disadvantage of high communication overhead between edge device and server. To
reduce the communication overhead, this paper proposes a loss-based
asynchronous training scheme that updates the client-side model less frequently
and only sends/receives activations/gradients in selected epochs. To further
reduce the communication overhead, the activations/gradients are quantized
using 8-bit floating point prior to transmission. An added benefit of the
proposed communication reduction method is that the computations at the client
side are reduced due to reduction in the number of client model updates.
Furthermore, the privacy of the proposed communication reduction based split
learning method is almost the same as traditional split learning. Simulation
results on VGG11, VGG13 and ResNet18 models on CIFAR-10 show that the
communication cost is reduced by 1.64x-106.7x and the computations in the
client are reduced by 2.86x-32.1x when the accuracy degradation is less than
0.5% for the single-client case. For 5 and 10-client cases, the communication

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Traffic signal control is one of the most effective methods of traffic
management in urban areas. In recent years, traffic control methods based on
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have gained attention due to their ability to
exploit real-time traffic data, which is often poorly used by the traditional
hand-crafted methods. While most recent DRL-based methods have focused on
maximizing the throughput or minimizing the average travel time of the
vehicles, the fairness of the traffic signal controllers has often been
neglected. This is particularly important as neglecting fairness can lead to
situations where some vehicles experience extreme waiting times, or where the
throughput of a particular traffic flow is highly impacted by the fluctuations
of another conflicting flow at the intersection. In order to address these
issues, we introduce two notions of fairness: delay-based and throughput-based
fairness, which correspond to the two issues mentioned above. Furthermore, we
propose two DRL-based traffic signal control methods for implementing these
fairness notions, that can achieve a high throughput as well. We evaluate the
performance of our proposed methods using three traffic arrival distributions,
and find that our methods outperform the baselines in the tested scenarios.]]></summary>

be capable of exactly memorizing even randomly labelled data. Empirical studies

cross-entropy or squared error loss, results in significant improvement in the
ability of the network to resist such overfitting. We then provide a formal

have underlined the need for developing novel diagnosis and intervention
pipelines that can learn rapidly from small amounts of labeled data. Combined
with technological advances in next-generation sequencing, metagenome-based
diagnostic tools hold much promise to revolutionize rapid point-of-care
diagnosis. However, there are significant challenges in developing such an
approach, the chief among which is to learn self-supervised representations
that can help detect novel pathogen signatures with very low amounts of labeled
data. This is particularly a difficult task given that closely related
pathogens can share more than 90% of their genome structure. In this work, we
address these challenges by proposing MG-Net, a self-supervised representation
learning framework that leverages multi-modal context using pseudo-imaging data
derived from clinical metagenome sequences. We show that the proposed framework
can learn robust representations from unlabeled data that can be used for
downstream tasks such as metagenome sequence classification with limited access
to labeled data. Extensive experiments show that the learned features
outperform current baseline metagenome representations, given only 1000 samples
per class.]]></summary>

machine-learned predictions to overcome worst case lower bounds. This area has
revealed interesting algorithmic insights into problems, with particular
success in the design of competitive online algorithms. However, the question
of improving algorithm running times with predictions has largely been
unexplored.

We take a first step in this direction by combining the idea of
machine-learned predictions with the idea of "warm-starting" primal-dual
algorithms. We consider one of the most important primitives in combinatorial
optimization: weighted bipartite matching and its generalization to
$b$-matching. We identify three key challenges when using learned dual
variables in a primal-dual algorithm. First, predicted duals may be infeasible,
so we give an algorithm that efficiently maps predicted infeasible duals to
nearby feasible solutions. Second, once the duals are feasible, they may not be
optimal, so we show that they can be used to quickly find an optimal solution.
Finally, such predictions are useful only if they can be learned, so we show
that the problem of learning duals for matching has low sample complexity. We
validate our theoretical findings through experiments on both real and
synthetic data. As a result we give a rigorous, practical, and empirically
effective method to compute bipartite matchings.]]></summary>

which deals with convoluted and overlapping boundaries that arise due to
several labels being active for a particular data instance. We propose a
classifier capable of extracting underlying features and introducing
non-linearity to the data to handle the complex decision boundaries. A novel
neural network model has been developed where the input features are subjected
to two transformations adapted from multi-label functional link artificial
neural network and autoencoders. First, a functional expansion of the original
features are made using basis functions. This is followed by an
autoencoder-aided transformation and reduction on the expanded features. This
network is capable of improving separability for the multi-label data owing to
the two-layer transformation while reducing the expanded feature space to a
more manageable amount. This balances the input dimension which leads to a
better classification performance even for a limited amount of data. The
proposed network has been validated on five ML datasets which shows its
superior performance in comparison with six well-established ML classifiers.
Furthermore, a single-label variation of the proposed network has also been
formulated simultaneously and tested on four relevant datasets against three
existing classifiers to establish its effectiveness.]]></summary>

used for unsupervised anomaly detection. While performance keeps improving,
several limitations exist particularly attributed to difficulties at capturing
multimodal supports and to the ability to approximate the underlying
distribution closer to the tails, i.e. the boundary of the distribution's
support. This paper proposes an approach that attempts to alleviate such
shortcomings. We propose an invertible-residual-network-based model, the
Boundary of Distribution Support Generator (BDSG). GANs generally do not
guarantee the existence of a probability distribution and here, we use the
recently developed Invertible Residual Network (IResNet) and Residual Flow
(ResFlow), for density estimation. These models have not yet been used for
anomaly detection. We leverage IResNet and ResFlow for Out-of-Distribution
(OoD) sample detection and for sample generation on the boundary using a
compound loss function that forces the samples to lie on the boundary. The BDSG
addresses non-convex support, disjoint components, and multimodal
distributions. Results on synthetic data and data from multimodal
distributions, such as MNIST and CIFAR-10, demonstrate competitive performance
compared to methods from the literature.]]></summary>

critical cardiovascular syndromes such as arrhythmia and myocardial infarction
(MI). Current machine learning techniques either depend on manually extracted
features or large and complex deep learning networks which merely utilize the
1D ECG signal directly. Since intelligent multimodal fusion can perform at the
stateof-the-art level with an efficient deep network, therefore, in this paper,
we propose two computationally efficient multimodal fusion frameworks for ECG
heart beat classification called Multimodal Image Fusion (MIF) and Multimodal
Feature Fusion (MFF). At the input of these frameworks, we convert the raw ECG
data into three different images using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Recurrence
Plot (RP) and Markov Transition Field (MTF). In MIF, we first perform image
fusion by combining three imaging modalities to create a single image modality
which serves as input to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In MFF, we
extracted features from penultimate layer of CNNs and fused them to get unique
and interdependent information necessary for better performance of classifier.
These informational features are finally used to train a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) classifier for ECG heart-beat classification. We demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed fusion models by performing experiments on
PhysioNets MIT-BIH dataset for five distinct conditions of arrhythmias which
are consistent with the AAMI EC57 protocols and on PTB diagnostics dataset for
Myocardial Infarction (MI) classification. We achieved classification accuracy
of 99.7% and 99.2% on arrhythmia and MI classification, respectively.]]></summary>

communicating due to social isolation and quarantine. Also, it was the primary
source of misinformation dissemination on a large scale, referred to as the

To tackle this problem, we present two COVID-19 related misinformation datasets
on Twitter and propose a misinformation detection system comprising
network-based and content-based processes based on machine learning algorithms
and NLP techniques. In the network-based process, we focus on social
properties, network characteristics, and users. On the other hand, we classify
misinformation using the content of the tweets directly in the content-based
process, which contains text classification models (paragraph-level and
sentence-level) and similarity models. The evaluation results on the
network-based process show the best results for the artificial neural network
model with an F1 score of 88.68%. In the content-based process, our novel
similarity models, which obtained an F1 score of 90.26%, show an improvement in
the misinformation classification results compared to the network-based models.
In addition, in the text classification models, the best result was achieved
using the stacking ensemble-learning model by obtaining an F1 score of 95.18%.
Furthermore, we test our content-based models on the Constraint@AAAI2021
dataset, and by getting an F1 score of 94.38%, we improve the baseline results.
Finally, we develop a fact-checking website called Checkovid that uses each
process to detect misinformative and informative claims in the domain of
COVID-19 from different perspectives.]]></summary>

target task demonstrations. Prior approaches for demonstration-guided RL treat
every new task as an independent learning problem and attempt to follow the
provided demonstrations step-by-step, akin to a human trying to imitate a
completely unseen behavior by following the demonstrator's exact muscle
movements. Naturally, such learning will be slow, but often new behaviors are
not completely unseen: they share subtasks with behaviors we have previously
learned. In this work, we aim to exploit this shared subtask structure to
increase the efficiency of demonstration-guided RL. We first learn a set of
reusable skills from large offline datasets of prior experience collected
across many tasks. We then propose Skill-based Learning with Demonstrations
(SkiLD), an algorithm for demonstration-guided RL that efficiently leverages
the provided demonstrations by following the demonstrated skills instead of the
primitive actions, resulting in substantial performance improvements over prior
demonstration-guided RL approaches. We validate the effectiveness of our
approach on long-horizon maze navigation and complex robot manipulation tasks.]]></summary>

features from images for enabling detection of a vast amount of object types.
However, utilization of such backbones in object detection applications
developed for specific object types can unnecessarily over-process an extensive
amount of background. In addition, they are agnostic to object scales, thus
redundantly process all image regions at the same resolution. In this work we
introduce BLT-net, a new low-computation two-stage object detection
architecture designed to process images with a significant amount of background
and objects of variate scales. BLT-net reduces computations by separating
objects from background using a very lite first-stage. BLT-net then efficiently
merges obtained proposals to further decrease processed background and then
dynamically reduces their resolution to minimize computations. Resulting image
proposals are then processed in the second-stage by a highly accurate model. We
demonstrate our architecture on the pedestrian detection problem, where objects
are of different sizes, images are of high resolution and object detection is
required to run in real-time. We show that our design reduces computations by a
factor of x4-x7 on the Citypersons and Caltech datasets with respect to leading
pedestrian detectors, on account of a small accuracy degradation. This method
can be applied on other object detection applications in scenes with a
considerable amount of background and variate object sizes to reduce
computations.]]></summary>

continued access to source data during adaptation, which may be infeasible due

to a new target domain given only unlabeled target data. We propose
Self-Supervised Selective Self-Training (S4T), a source-free adaptation
algorithm that first uses the model's pixel-level predictive consistency across
diverse views of each target image along with model confidence to classify
pixel predictions as either reliable or unreliable. Next, the model is
self-trained, using predicted pseudolabels for reliable predictions and
pseudolabels inferred via a selective interpolation strategy for unreliable
ones. S4T matches or improves upon the state-of-the-art in source-free

model's prediction for an individual will change due to the inclusion or
removal of a single other person in the model's training data. Leave-one-out
unfairness appeals to the idea that fair decisions are not arbitrary: they
should not be based on the chance event of any one person's inclusion in the
training data. Leave-one-out unfairness is closely related to algorithmic
stability, but it focuses on the consistency of an individual point's
prediction outcome over unit changes to the training data, rather than the
error of the model in aggregate. Beyond formalizing leave-one-out unfairness,
we characterize the extent to which deep models behave leave-one-out unfairly
on real data, including in cases where the generalization error is small.
Further, we demonstrate that adversarial training and randomized smoothing
techniques have opposite effects on leave-one-out fairness, which sheds light
on the relationships between robustness, memorization, individual fairness, and
leave-one-out fairness in deep models. Finally, we discuss salient practical
applications that may be negatively affected by leave-one-out unfairness.]]></summary>

of main abdominal organs seems to be a solved problem as state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods have achieved comparable results with inter-rater variability on
many benchmark datasets. However, most of the existing abdominal datasets only
contain single-center, single-phase, single-vendor, or single-disease cases,
and it is unclear whether the excellent performance can generalize on diverse
datasets. This paper presents a large and diverse abdominal CT organ
segmentation dataset, termed AbdomenCT-1K, with more than 1000 (1K) CT scans
from 12 medical centers, including multi-phase, multi-vendor, and multi-disease
cases. Furthermore, we conduct a large-scale study for liver, kidney, spleen,
and pancreas segmentation and reveal the unsolved segmentation problems of the
SOTA methods, such as the limited generalization ability on distinct medical
centers, phases, and unseen diseases. To advance the unsolved problems, we
further build four organ segmentation benchmarks for fully supervised,
semi-supervised, weakly supervised, and continual learning, which are currently
challenging and active research topics. Accordingly, we develop a simple and
effective method for each benchmark, which can be used as out-of-the-box
methods and strong baselines. We believe the AbdomenCT-1K dataset will promote
future in-depth research towards clinical applicable abdominal organ
segmentation methods. The datasets, codes, and trained models are publicly

valuable guidance for graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn nodes'
representations. Existing GCN models that capture nodes' structural information
weight in- and out-neighbors equally or differentiate in- and out-neighbors
globally without considering nodes' local topologies. We observe that in- and
out-neighbors contribute differently for nodes with different local topologies.
To explore the directional structural information for different nodes, we
propose a GCN model with weighted structural features, named WGCN. WGCN first
captures nodes' structural fingerprints via a direction and degree aware Random
Walk with Restart algorithm, where the walk is guided by both edge direction
and nodes' in- and out-degrees. Then, the interactions between nodes'
structural fingerprints are used as the weighted node structural features. To
further capture nodes' high-order dependencies and graph geometry, WGCN embeds
graphs into a latent space to obtain nodes' latent neighbors and geometrical
relationships. Based on nodes' geometrical relationships in the latent space,
WGCN differentiates latent, in-, and out-neighbors with an attention-based
geometrical aggregation. Experiments on transductive node classification tasks
show that WGCN outperforms the baseline models consistently by up to 17.07% in

resizing and adding the resulting object 3D feature maps over background scene
feature maps. We show that classifiers for object categories, color, materials,

versatile backbone for visual recognition and dense predictions, unlike modern
MLP architectures, e.g., MLP-Mixer, ResMLP, and gMLP, whose architectures are
correlated to image size and thus are infeasible in object detection and
segmentation. CycleMLP has two advantages compared to modern approaches. (1) It
can cope with various image sizes. (2) It achieves linear computational
complexity to image size by using local windows. In contrast, previous MLPs
have quadratic computations because of their fully spatial connections. We
build a family of models that surpass existing MLPs and achieve a comparable
accuracy (83.2%) on ImageNet-1K classification compared to the state-of-the-art
Transformer such as Swin Transformer (83.3%) but using fewer parameters and
FLOPs. We expand the MLP-like models' applicability, making them a versatile
backbone for dense prediction tasks. CycleMLP aims to provide a competitive
baseline on object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation
for MLP models. In particular, CycleMLP achieves 45.1 mIoU on ADE20K val,

signal processing and control. For systems that are well-represented by a fully
known linear Gaussian state space (SS) model, the celebrated Kalman filter (KF)
is a low complexity optimal solution. However, both linearity of the underlying
SS model and accurate knowledge of it are often not encountered in practice.
Here, we present KalmanNet, a real-time state estimator that learns from data
to carry out Kalman filtering under non-linear dynamics with partial

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Radiation exposure in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging limits its
usage in the studies of radiation-sensitive populations, e.g., pregnant women,
children, and adults that require longitudinal imaging. Reducing the PET
radiotracer dose or acquisition time reduces photon counts, which can
deteriorate image quality. Recent deep-neural-network (DNN) based methods for
image-to-image translation enable the mapping of low-quality PET images
(acquired using substantially reduced dose), coupled with the associated
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, to high-quality PET images. However,
such DNN methods focus on applications involving test data that match the
statistical characteristics of the training data very closely and give little
attention to evaluating the performance of these DNNs on new
out-of-distribution (OOD) acquisitions. We propose a novel DNN formulation that
models the (i) underlying sinogram-based physics of the PET imaging system and
(ii) the uncertainty in the DNN output through the per-voxel heteroscedasticity
of the residuals between the predicted and the high-quality reference images.
Our sinogram-based uncertainty-aware DNN framework, namely, suDNN, estimates a
standard-dose PET image using multimodal input in the form of (i) a
low-dose/low-count PET image and (ii) the corresponding multi-contrast MRI
images, leading to improved robustness of suDNN to OOD acquisitions. Results on
in vivo simultaneous PET-MRI, and various forms of OOD data in PET-MRI, show
the benefits of suDNN over the current state of the art, quantitatively and
qualitatively.]]></summary>

accurately determined from clinical indicators. This is due in part to the
heterogeneity of damage inflicted to the brain, ultimately resulting in diverse
and complex outcomes. Using a data-driven approach on many distinct data
elements may be necessary to describe this large set of outcomes and thereby
robustly depict the nuanced differences among TBI patients' recovery. In this
work, we develop a method for modeling large heterogeneous data types relevant
to TBI. Our approach is geared toward the probabilistic representation of mixed
continuous and discrete variables with missing values. The model is trained on
a dataset encompassing a variety of data types, including demographics,
blood-based biomarkers, and imaging findings. In addition, it includes a set of
clinical outcome assessments at 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury. The model is
used to stratify patients into distinct groups in an unsupervised learning
setting. We use the model to infer outcomes using input data, and show that the
collection of input data reduces uncertainty of outcomes over a baseline
approach. In addition, we quantify the performance of a likelihood scoring
technique that can be used to self-evaluate the extrapolation risk of prognosis
on unseen patients.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The performance of deep neural networks crucially depends on good
hyperparameter configurations. Bayesian optimization is a powerful framework
for optimizing the hyperparameters of DNNs. These methods need sufficient
evaluation data to approximate and minimize the validation error function of
hyperparameters. However, the expensive evaluation cost of DNNs leads to very
few evaluation data within a limited time, which greatly reduces the efficiency
of Bayesian optimization. Besides, the previous researches focus on using the
complete evaluation data to conduct Bayesian optimization, and ignore the
intermediate evaluation data generated by early stopping methods. To alleviate
the insufficient evaluation data problem, we propose a fast hyperparameter
optimization method, HOIST, that utilizes both the complete and intermediate
evaluation data to accelerate the hyperparameter optimization of DNNs.
Specifically, we train multiple basic surrogates to gather information from the
mixed evaluation data, and then combine all basic surrogates using weighted
bagging to provide an accurate ensemble surrogate. Our empirical studies show
that HOIST outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on a wide range of DNNs,
including feed forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks,
recurrent neural networks, and variational autoencoder.]]></summary>

preserve the privacy of the users, therefore we do not allow any communication

In order to train the controllers, we use the idea of imitation learning --
we first find an optimum solution for a relaxed version of the problem using
quadratic optimization and then train the controllers to imitate this solution.
We also investigate the effects of regularization of the optimum solution on
the performance of the controllers. The method is evaluated on realistic data
and shows improved performance and training speed compared to similar

analyze the real-world evidence (RWE) of COVID-19 pharmacotherapy and validate
the results of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Machine learning (ML) methods
are being used in RWE and are promising tools for precision-medicine. In this
study, ML methods are applied to study the efficacy of therapies on COVID-19
hospital admissions in the Valencian Region in Spain. Methods: 5244 and 1312
COVID-19 hospital admissions - dated between January 2020 and January 2021 from
10 health departments, were used respectively for training and validation of
separate treatment-effect models (TE-ML) for remdesivir, corticosteroids,
tocilizumab, lopinavir-ritonavir, azithromycin and
chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. 2390 admissions from 2 additional health
departments were reserved as an independent test to analyze retrospectively the
survival benefits of therapies in the population selected by the TE-ML models
using cox-proportional hazard models. TE-ML models were adjusted using
treatment propensity scores to control for pre-treatment confounding variables
associated to outcome and further evaluated for futility. ML architecture was
based on boosted decision-trees. Results: In the populations identified by the
TE-ML models, only Remdesivir and Tocilizumab were significantly associated
with an increase in survival time, with hazard ratios of 0.41 (P = 0.04) and
0.21 (P = 0.001), respectively. No survival benefits from chloroquine
derivatives, lopinavir-ritonavir and azithromycin were demonstrated. Tools to
explain the predictions of TE-ML models are explored at patient-level as
potential tools for personalized decision making and precision medicine.
Conclusion: ML methods are suitable tools toward RWE analysis of COVID-19
pharmacotherapies. Results obtained reproduce published results on RWE and
validate the results from RCTs.]]></summary>

obstacles including: the need for labeled data, the violation of the locality
learning principle, the need for symmetric connections, and the lack of
modularity. Tourbillon is a new architecture that addresses all these
limitations. At its core, it consists of a stack of circular autoencoders
followed by an output layer. The circular autoencoders are trained in
self-supervised mode by recirculation algorithms and the top layer in
supervised mode by stochastic gradient descent, with the option of propagating
error information through the entire stack using non-symmetric connections.
While the Tourbillon architecture is meant primarily to address physical
constraints, and not to improve current engineering applications of deep
learning, we demonstrate its viability on standard benchmark datasets including
MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR10. We show that Tourbillon can achieve
comparable performance to models trained with backpropagation and outperform

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present polynomial time and sample efficient algorithms for learning an
unknown depth-2 feedforward neural network with general ReLU activations, under
mild non-degeneracy assumptions. In particular, we consider learning an unknown
network of the form $f(x) = {a}^{\mathsf{T}}\sigma({W}^\mathsf{T}x+b)$, where
$x$ is drawn from the Gaussian distribution, and $\sigma(t) := \max(t,0)$ is
the ReLU activation. Prior works for learning networks with ReLU activations
assume that the bias $b$ is zero. In order to deal with the presence of the
bias terms, our proposed algorithm consists of robustly decomposing multiple
higher order tensors arising from the Hermite expansion of the function $f(x)$.
Using these ideas we also establish identifiability of the network parameters
under minimal assumptions.]]></summary>

success of software projects. To support such activities and keep code
up-to-date and error-free, software communities make use of issue trackers,
i.e., tools for signaling, handling, and addressing the issues occurring in
software systems. However, in popular projects, tens or hundreds of issue
reports are daily submitted. In this context, identifying the type of each
submitted report (e.g., bug report, feature request, etc.) would facilitate the
management and the prioritization of the issues to address. To support issue
handling activities, in this paper, we propose Ticket Tagger, a GitHub app
analyzing the issue title and description through machine learning techniques
to automatically recognize the types of reports submitted on GitHub and assign
labels to each issue accordingly. We empirically evaluated the tool's
prediction performance on about 30,000 GitHub issues. Our results show that the
Ticket Tagger can identify the correct labels to assign to GitHub issues with
reasonably high effectiveness. Considering these results and the fact that the
tool is designed to be easily integrated in the GitHub issue management
process, Ticket Tagger consists in a useful solution for developers.]]></summary>

trajectories and use support vector machines to determine the boundaries
between initial conditions corresponding to different classes of trajectories.
We then show that these boundaries between different classes of trajectories
approximate invariant phase space structures of the same type observed in
earlier analyses of Chesnavich's model. Our approach is designed with

three-dimensional (3D) medical images has great potential that can be extended
to many medical applications, such as, image enhancement and disease
progression modeling. However, current GAN technologies for 3D medical image
synthesis need to be significantly improved to be readily adapted to real-world
medical problems. In this paper, we extend the state-of-the-art StyleGAN2
model, which natively works with two-dimensional images, to enable 3D image
synthesis. In addition to the image synthesis, we investigate the
controllability and interpretability of the 3D-StyleGAN via style vectors
inherited form the original StyleGAN2 that are highly suitable for medical
applications: (i) the latent space projection and reconstruction of unseen real
images, and (ii) style mixing. We demonstrate the 3D-StyleGAN's performance and
feasibility with ~12,000 three-dimensional full brain MR T1 images, although it
can be applied to any 3D volumetric images. Furthermore, we explore different
configurations of hyperparameters to investigate potential improvement of the
image synthesis with larger networks. The codes and pre-trained networks are

spectrum of important applications, from image recognition to autonomous
vehicles. Unfortunately, DNNs are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks
that affect virtually all state-of-the-art models. These attacks make small
imperceptible modifications to inputs that are sufficient to induce the DNNs to
produce the wrong classification.

In this paper we propose a novel, lightweight adversarial correction and/or
detection mechanism for image classifiers that relies on undervolting (running
a chip at a voltage that is slightly below its safe margin). We propose using
controlled undervolting of the chip running the inference process in order to
introduce a limited number of compute errors. We show that these errors disrupt
the adversarial input in a way that can be used either to correct the
classification or detect the input as adversarial. We evaluate the proposed
solution in an FPGA design and through software simulation. We evaluate 10
attacks on two popular DNNs and show an average detection rate of 80% to 95%.]]></summary>

solving new tasks, which suggests the need for learning algorithms that can
modify the mechanisms for choosing certain actions independently of those for

achieve this kind of modular credit assignment. To answer this question, we
define modular credit assignment as a constraint on minimizing the algorithmic
mutual information among feedback signals for different decisions. We introduce
what we call the modularity criterion for testing whether a learning algorithm
satisfies this constraint by performing causal analysis on the algorithm
itself. We generalize the recently proposed societal decision-making framework
as a more granular formalism than the Markov decision process to prove that for
decision sequences that do not contain cycles, certain single-step temporal
difference action-value methods meet this criterion while all policy-gradient

optimization over a rolling time horizon with a model predictive control (MPC)
component that relocates idle vehicles to anticipate the demand. The MPC
optimization operates over a longer time horizon to compensate for the inherent
myopic nature of the real-time dispatching. These longer time horizons are
beneficial for the quality of relocation decisions but increase computational
complexity. Consequently, the ride-sharing operators are often forced to use a
relatively short time horizon. To address this computational challenge, this
paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines machine learning and
optimization. The machine-learning component learns the optimal solution to the
MPC on the aggregated level to overcome the sparsity and high-dimensionality of
the solution. The optimization component transforms the machine-learning
prediction back to the original granularity through a tractable transportation
model. As a consequence, the original NP-hard MPC problem is reduced to a
polynomial time prediction and optimization, which allows the ride-sharing
operators to consider a longer time horizon. Experimental results show that the
hybrid approach achieves significantly better service quality than the MPC
optimization in terms of average rider waiting time, due to its ability to
model a longer horizon.]]></summary>

hands and information devices owing to its ability to reflect human motion
intentions. Although various EMG classification methods have been introduced
into EMG-based control systems, they do not fully consider the stochastic
characteristics of EMG signals. This paper proposes an EMG pattern
classification method incorporating a scale mixture-based generative model. A
scale mixture model is a stochastic EMG model in which the EMG variance is
considered as a random variable, enabling the representation of uncertainty in
the variance. This model is extended in this study and utilized for EMG pattern
classification. The proposed method is trained by variational Bayesian
learning, thereby allowing the automatic determination of the model complexity.
Furthermore, to optimize the hyperparameters of the proposed method with a
partial discriminative approach, a mutual information-based determination
method is introduced. Simulation and EMG analysis experiments demonstrated the
relationship between the hyperparameters and classification accuracy of the
proposed method as well as the validity of the proposed method. The comparison
using public EMG datasets revealed that the proposed method outperformed the
various conventional classifiers. These results indicated the validity of the
proposed method and its applicability to EMG-based control systems. In EMG
pattern recognition, a classifier based on a generative model that reflects the
stochastic characteristics of EMG signals can outperform the conventional
general-purpose classifier.]]></summary>

how users interact with multimodal items is a continuing concern within the
rapid development of recommender systems. The majority of previous work focuses
on modeling user-item interactions with multimodal features included as side
information. However, this scheme is not well-designed for multimedia
recommendation. Specifically, only collaborative item-item relationships are
implicitly modeled through high-order item-user-item relations. Considering
that items are associated with rich contents in multiple modalities, we argue
that the latent semantic item-item structures underlying these multimodal
contents could be beneficial for learning better item representations and
further boosting recommendation. To this end, we propose a LATent sTructure
mining method for multImodal reCommEndation, which we term LATTICE for brevity.
To be specific, in the proposed LATTICE model, we devise a novel modality-aware
structure learning layer, which learns item-item structures for each modality
and aggregates multiple modalities to obtain latent item graphs. Based on the
learned latent graphs, we perform graph convolutions to explicitly inject
high-order item affinities into item representations. These enriched item
representations can then be plugged into existing collaborative filtering
methods to make more accurate recommendations. Extensive experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art multimedia recommendation methods and validate the efficacy of
mining latent item-item relationships from multimodal features.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this work we introduce a manifold learning-based method for uncertainty
quantification (UQ) in systems describing complex spatiotemporal processes. Our
first objective is to identify the embedding of a set of high-dimensional data
representing quantities of interest of the computational or analytical model.
For this purpose, we employ Grassmannian diffusion maps, a two-step nonlinear
dimension reduction technique which allows us to reduce the dimensionality of
the data and identify meaningful geometric descriptions in a parsimonious and
inexpensive manner. Polynomial chaos expansion is then used to construct a
mapping between the stochastic input parameters and the diffusion coordinates
of the reduced space. An adaptive clustering technique is proposed to identify
an optimal number of clusters of points in the latent space. The similarity of
points allows us to construct a number of geometric harmonic emulators which
are finally utilized as a set of inexpensive pre-trained models to perform an
inverse map of realizations of latent features to the ambient space and thus
perform accurate out-of-sample predictions. Thus, the proposed method acts as
an encoder-decoder system which is able to automatically handle very
high-dimensional data while simultaneously operating successfully in the
small-data regime. The method is demonstrated on two benchmark problems and on
a system of advection-diffusion-reaction equations which model a first-order
chemical reaction between two species. In all test cases, the proposed method
is able to achieve highly accurate approximations which ultimately lead to the
significant acceleration of UQ tasks.]]></summary>

tools. This study demonstrates that we can effectively and automatically learn
a good heuristic via reinforcement learning for an invariant synthesizer PCSat.
Our experiment shows that PCSat combined with the heuristic learned by

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bayesian Networks have been widely used in the last decades in many fields,
to describe statistical dependencies among random variables. In general,
learning the structure of such models is a problem with considerable
theoretical interest that poses many challenges. On the one hand, it is a
well-known NP-complete problem, practically hardened by the huge search space
of possible solutions. On the other hand, the phenomenon of I-equivalence,
i.e., different graphical structures underpinning the same set of statistical
dependencies, may lead to multimodal fitness landscapes further hindering
maximum likelihood approaches to solve the task. In particular, we exploit the
NSGA-II multi-objective optimization procedure in order to explicitly account
for both the likelihood of a solution and the number of selected arcs, by
setting these as the two objective functions of the method. The aim of this
work is to investigate the behavior of NSGA-II and analyse the quality of its
solutions. We thus thoroughly examined the optimization results obtained on a
wide set of simulated data, by considering both the goodness of the inferred
solutions in terms of the objective functions values achieved, and by comparing
the retrieved structures with the ground truth, i.e., the networks used to
generate the target data. Our results show that NSGA-II can converge to
solutions characterized by better likelihood and less arcs than classic
approaches, although paradoxically characterized in many cases by a lower
similarity with the target network.]]></summary>

presence of large-scale labeled datasets. However, it is prohibitively
time-costly and labor-expensive to collect sufficient labeled data in most
realistic scenarios. To mitigate the requirement for labeled data,
semi-supervised learning (SSL) focuses on simultaneously exploring both labeled
and unlabeled data, while transfer learning (TL) popularizes a favorable
practice of fine-tuning a pre-trained model to the target data. A dilemma is
thus encountered: Without a decent pre-trained model to provide an implicit
regularization, SSL through self-training from scratch will be easily misled by
inaccurate pseudo-labels, especially in large-sized label space; Without
exploring the intrinsic structure of unlabeled data, TL through fine-tuning
from limited labeled data is at risk of under-transfer caused by model shift.
To escape from this dilemma, we present Self-Tuning to enable data-efficient

with rare alphabets, is a challenging problem. The main difficulty comes from
the very few annotated data and the limited linguistic information (e.g.
dictionaries and language models). Thus, we propose a few-shot learning-based
handwriting recognition approach that significantly reduces the human labor
annotation process, requiring only few images of each alphabet symbol. First,
our model detects all symbols of a given alphabet in a textline image, then a
decoding step maps the symbol similarity scores to the final sequence of
transcribed symbols. Our model is first pretrained on synthetic line images
generated from any alphabet, even though different from the target domain. A
second training step is then applied to diminish the gap between the source and
target data. Since this retraining would require annotation of thousands of
handwritten symbols together with their bounding boxes, we propose to avoid
such human effort through an unsupervised progressive learning approach that
automatically assigns pseudo-labels to the non-annotated data. The evaluation
on different manuscript datasets show that our model can lead to competitive
results with a significant reduction in human effort.]]></summary>

but its acquisition speed is quite slow due to the physiological limitations.
Recently, super-resolution methods have shown excellent performance in
accelerating MRI. In some circumstances, it is difficult to obtain
high-resolution images even with prolonged scan time. Therefore, we proposed a
novel super-resolution method that uses a generative adversarial network (GAN)
with cyclic loss and attention mechanism to generate high-resolution MR images
from low-resolution MR images by a factor of 2. We implemented our model on
pelvic images from healthy subjects as training and validation data, while
those data from patients were used for testing. The MR dataset was obtained
using different imaging sequences, including T2, T2W SPAIR, and mDIXON-W. Four
methods, i.e., BICUBIC, SRCNN, SRGAN, and EDSR were used for comparison.
Structural similarity, peak signal to noise ratio, root mean square error, and
variance inflation factor were used as calculation indicators to evaluate the
performances of the proposed method. Various experimental results showed that
our method can better restore the details of the high-resolution MR image as
compared to the other methods. In addition, the reconstructed high-resolution
MR image can provide better lesion textures in the tumor patients, which is
promising to be used in clinical diagnosis.]]></summary>

recent years owing to their capability to model and learn from graph-structured
data. Such an ability has strong implications in a wide variety of fields whose
data is inherently relational, for which conventional neural networks do not
perform well. Indeed, as recent reviews can attest, research in the area of
GNNs has grown rapidly and has lead to the development of a variety of GNN
algorithm variants as well as to the exploration of groundbreaking applications
in chemistry, neurology, electronics, or communication networks, among others.
At the current stage of research, however, the efficient processing of GNNs is
still an open challenge for several reasons. Besides of their novelty, GNNs are
hard to compute due to their dependence on the input graph, their combination
of dense and very sparse operations, or the need to scale to huge graphs in
some applications. In this context, this paper aims to make two main
contributions. On the one hand, a review of the field of GNNs is presented from
the perspective of computing. This includes a brief tutorial on the GNN
fundamentals, an overview of the evolution of the field in the last decade, and
a summary of operations carried out in the multiple phases of different GNN
algorithm variants. On the other hand, an in-depth analysis of current software
and hardware acceleration schemes is provided, from which a hardware-software,
graph-aware, and communication-centric vision for GNN accelerators is
distilled.]]></summary>

single-step policies or single-step models, leveraging the Markov property to
factorize the problem in time. However, we can also view RL as a sequence
modeling problem, with the goal being to predict a sequence of actions that
leads to a sequence of high rewards. Viewed in this way, it is tempting to
consider whether powerful, high-capacity sequence prediction models that work
well in other domains, such as natural-language processing, can also provide
simple and effective solutions to the RL problem. To this end, we explore how
RL can be reframed as "one big sequence modeling" problem, using
state-of-the-art Transformer architectures to model distributions over
sequences of states, actions, and rewards. Addressing RL as a sequence modeling
problem significantly simplifies a range of design decisions: we no longer
require separate behavior policy constraints, as is common in prior work on
offline model-free RL, and we no longer require ensembles or other epistemic
uncertainty estimators, as is common in prior work on model-based RL. All of
these roles are filled by the same Transformer sequence model. In our
experiments, we demonstrate the flexibility of this approach across
long-horizon dynamics prediction, imitation learning, goal-conditioned RL, and
offline RL.]]></summary>

promising successes in goodness-of-fit tests and model learning in high
dimensions. Despite their theoretical elegance, their empirical performance
depends crucially on the search of optimal slicing directions to discriminate
between two distributions. Unfortunately, previous gradient-based optimisation
approaches for this task return sub-optimal results: they are computationally
expensive, sensitive to initialization, and they lack theoretical guarantees
for convergence. We address these issues in two steps. First, we provide
theoretical results stating that the requirement of using optimal slicing
directions in the kernelized version of SSD can be relaxed, validating the
resulting discrepancy with finite random slicing directions. Second, given that
good slicing directions are crucial for practical performance, we propose a
fast algorithm for finding such slicing directions based on ideas of active
sub-space construction and spectral decomposition. Experiments on
goodness-of-fit tests and model learning show that our approach achieves both
improved performance and faster convergence. Especially, we demonstrate a
14-80x speed-up in goodness-of-fit tests when comparing with gradient-based

meta-RL) problem setting and proposes an algorithm that performs well in this
setting. Offline meta-RL is analogous to the widely successful supervised
learning strategy of pre-training a model on a large batch of fixed,
pre-collected data (possibly from various tasks) and fine-tuning the model to a
new task with relatively little data. That is, in offline meta-RL, we
meta-train on fixed, pre-collected data from several tasks in order to adapt to
a new task with a very small amount (less than 5 trajectories) of data from the
new task. By nature of being offline, algorithms for offline meta-RL can
utilize the largest possible pool of training data available and eliminate
potentially unsafe or costly data collection during meta-training. This setting
inherits the challenges of offline RL, but it differs significantly because
offline RL does not generally consider a) transfer to new tasks or b) limited
data from the test task, both of which we face in offline meta-RL. Targeting
the offline meta-RL setting, we propose Meta-Actor Critic with Advantage
Weighting (MACAW), an optimization-based meta-learning algorithm that uses
simple, supervised regression objectives for both the inner and outer loop of
meta-training. On offline variants of common meta-RL benchmarks, we empirically
find that this approach enables fully offline meta-reinforcement learning and
achieves notable gains over prior methods.]]></summary>

the sphere, which arises in various machine learning applications such as
orthogonal dictionary learning (ODL) and robust subspace recovery (RSR). The
problem is numerically challenging due to its nonsmooth objective and nonconvex
constraint, and its algorithmic aspects have not been well explored. In this
paper, we show how the manifold structure of the sphere can be exploited to
design fast algorithms for tackling this problem. Specifically, our
contribution is threefold. First, we present a manifold proximal point
algorithm (ManPPA) for the problem and show that it converges at a sublinear
rate. Furthermore, we show that ManPPA can achieve a quadratic convergence rate
when applied to the ODL and RSR problems. Second, we propose a stochastic
variant of ManPPA called StManPPA, which is well suited for large-scale
computation, and establish its sublinear convergence rate. Both ManPPA and
StManPPA have provably faster convergence rates than existing subgradient-type
methods. Third, using ManPPA as a building block, we propose a new approach to
solving a matrix analog of the problem, in which the sphere is replaced by the
Stiefel manifold. The results from our extensive numerical experiments on the
ODL and RSR problems demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our proposed
methods.]]></summary>

society since a growing number of users use them for information seeking and
decision making. Therefore, it is crucial to address the potential unfairness
problems in recommendations. Just like users have personalized preferences on
items, users' demands for fairness are also personalized in many scenarios.
Therefore, it is important to provide personalized fair recommendations for
users to satisfy their personalized fairness demands. Besides, previous works
on fair recommendation mainly focus on association-based fairness. However, it
is important to advance from associative fairness notions to causal fairness
notions for assessing fairness more properly in recommender systems. Based on
the above considerations, this paper focuses on achieving personalized
counterfactual fairness for users in recommender systems. To this end, we
introduce a framework for achieving counterfactually fair recommendations
through adversary learning by generating feature-independent user embeddings
for recommendation. The framework allows recommender systems to achieve
personalized fairness for users while also covering non-personalized
situations. Experiments on two real-world datasets with shallow and deep
recommendation algorithms show that our method can generate fairer
recommendations for users with a desirable recommendation performance.]]></summary>

result, the trained models typically perform well for the majority of the data
but the performance may deteriorate in less dense regions of the dataset. This
issue also arises in generative modeling. A generative model may overlook
underrepresented modes that are less frequent in the empirical data
distribution. This problem is known as complete mode coverage. We propose a
sampling procedure based on ridge leverage scores which significantly improves
mode coverage when compared to standard methods and can easily be combined with
any GAN. Ridge leverage scores are computed by using an explicit feature map,
associated with the next-to-last layer of a GAN discriminator or of a

method first constructs a piecewise planar scaffolding of the scene, and then
uses it to infer dense depth using the image along with the sparse points. We

photometric consistency across time, forward-backward pose consistency, and
geometric compatibility with the sparse point cloud. We also launch the first
visual-inertial + depth dataset, which we hope will foster additional
exploration into combining the complementary strengths of visual and inertial

entities. These entities have properties -- both visible and latent -- that
determine the manner in which they interact with one another. To partition
images into entities, deep-learning researchers have proposed structural
inductive biases such as slot-based architectures. To model interactions among
entities, equivariant graph neural nets (GNNs) are used, but these are not
particularly well suited to the task for two reasons. First, GNNs do not
predispose interactions to be sparse, as relationships among independent
entities are likely to be. Second, GNNs do not factorize knowledge about
interactions in an entity-conditional manner. As an alternative, we take
inspiration from cognitive science and resurrect a classic approach, production
systems, which consist of a set of rule templates that are applied by binding
placeholder variables in the rules to specific entities. Rules are scored on
their match to entities, and the best fitting rules are applied to update
entity properties. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that this
architecture achieves a flexible, dynamic flow of control and serves to
factorize entity-specific and rule-based information. This disentangling of
knowledge achieves robust future-state prediction in rich visual environments,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods using GNNs, and allows for the
extrapolation from simple (few object) environments to more complex
environments.]]></summary>

that the area under the curve of the margin distribution on the training set is

model architecture. Compared to other deep models, DRMMs allow more flexible
conditional sampling: The model can be trained once with all variables, and
then used for sampling with arbitrary combinations of conditioning variables,
Gaussian priors, and (in)equality constraints. This provides new opportunities
for interactive and exploratory machine learning, where one should minimize the
user waiting for retraining a model. We demonstrate DRMMs in constrained

environment featuring interactions between different types of vehicles (speed
and dimension), under varying visibility and traffic conditions. Airport ground
movements are deemed safety-critical activities, and safe-separation procedures
must be maintained by Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs). Large airports with
complicated runway-taxiway systems use advanced ground surveillance systems.
However, these systems have inherent limitations and a lack of real-time
analytics. In this paper, we propose a novel computer-vision based framework,
namely "Deep4Air", which can not only augment the ground surveillance systems
via the automated visual monitoring of runways and taxiways for aircraft
location, but also provide real-time speed and distance analytics for aircraft
on runways and taxiways. The proposed framework includes an adaptive deep
neural network for efficiently detecting and tracking aircraft. The
experimental results show an average precision of detection and tracking of up
to 99.8% on simulated data with validations on surveillance videos from the
digital tower at George Bush Intercontinental Airport. The results also
demonstrate that "Deep4Air" can locate aircraft positions relative to the
airport runway and taxiway infrastructure with high accuracy. Furthermore,
aircraft speed and separation distance are monitored in real-time, providing
enhanced safety management.]]></summary>

inconspicuous texture changes of liver tumor, contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CT) imaging is effective for the diagnosis of liver cancer. In this
paper, we focus on improving automated liver tumor segmentation by integrating
multi-modal CT images. To this end, we propose a novel mutual learning (ML)
strategy for effective and robust multi-modal liver tumor segmentation.
Different from existing multi-modal methods that fuse information from
different modalities by a single model, with ML, an ensemble of
modality-specific models learn collaboratively and teach each other to distill
both the characteristics and the commonality between high-level representations
of different modalities. The proposed ML not only enables the superiority for
multi-modal learning but can also handle missing modalities by transferring
knowledge from existing modalities to missing ones. Additionally, we present a
modality-aware (MA) module, where the modality-specific models are
interconnected and calibrated with attention weights for adaptive information
exchange. The proposed modality-aware mutual learning (MAML) method achieves
promising results for liver tumor segmentation on a large-scale clinical
dataset. Moreover, we show the efficacy and robustness of MAML for handling
missing modalities on both the liver tumor and public brain tumor (BRATS 2018)

relationships as edges is the basis for a deep understanding of image content.
Despite recent advances, such as message passing and joint classification, the
detection of visual relationships remains a challenging task due to sub-optimal
exploration of the mutual interaction among the visual objects. In this work,
we propose a novel transformer formulation for scene graph generation and
relation prediction. We leverage the encoder-decoder architecture of the
transformer for rich feature embedding of nodes and edges. Specifically, we
model the node-to-node interaction with the self-attention of the transformer
encoder and the edge-to-node interaction with the cross-attention of the
transformer decoder. Further, we introduce a novel positional embedding
suitable to handle edges in the decoder. Finally, our relation prediction
module classifies the directed relation from the learned node and edge
embedding. We name this architecture as Relation Transformer Network (RTN). On
the Visual Genome and GQA dataset, we have achieved an overall mean of 4.85%
and 3.1% point improvement in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. Our
experiments show that Relation Transformer can efficiently model context across
various datasets with small, medium, and large-scale relation classification.]]></summary>

provide complementary information and microstructure details to improve the
operational performance and accuracy in brain surgery. However, compared to the
substantial image data, it is almost impossible to obtain the intraoperative 3D
shape information by using physical methods such as sensor scanning, especially
in minimally invasive surgery and robot-guided surgery. In this paper, a
general generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture based on graph
convolutional networks is proposed to reconstruct the 3D point clouds (PCs) of
brains by using one single 2D image, thus relieving the limitation of acquiring
3D shape data during surgery. Specifically, a tree-structured generative
mechanism is constructed to use the latent vector effectively and transfer
features between hidden layers accurately. With the proposed generative model,
a spontaneous image-to-PC conversion is finished in real-time. Competitive
qualitative and quantitative experimental results have been achieved on our
model. In multiple evaluation methods, the proposed model outperforms another
common point cloud generative model PointOutNet.]]></summary>

using point clouds from lidar or structured light sensors, we have few hundreds

method first constructs a piecewise planar scaffolding of the scene, and then
uses it to infer dense depth using the image along with the sparse points. We

photometric consistency across time, forward-backward pose consistency, and
geometric compatibility with the sparse point cloud. We also launch the first
visual-inertial + depth dataset, which we hope will foster additional
exploration into combining the complementary strengths of visual and inertial

description of an audio clip. Most captioning models follow an encoder-decoder

be limited in modelling temporal relationships among the time frames in an
audio signal, while RNNs can be limited in modelling the long-range

method has a better ability to model the global information within an audio

across different observations are not independent conditioned on their feature
vectors, but dependent, capturing settings where e.g. these observations are
collected on a spatial domain, a temporal domain, or a social network, which
induce dependencies. We model these dependencies in the language of Markov
Random Fields and, importantly, allow these dependencies to be substantial, i.e
do not assume that the Markov Random Field capturing these dependencies is in
high temperature. As our main contribution we provide algorithms and
statistically efficient estimation rates for this model, giving several
instantiations of our bounds in logistic regression, sparse logistic
regression, and neural network settings with dependent data. Our estimation
guarantees follow from novel results for estimating the parameters (i.e.
external fields and interaction strengths) of Ising models from a {\em single}
sample. {We evaluate our estimation approach on real networked data, showing
that it outperforms standard regression approaches that ignore dependencies,
across three text classification datasets: Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed.}]]></summary>

from incomplete and noisy perception. In this work, we draw insight that 3D
reconstruction and grasp learning are two intimately connected tasks, both of
which require a fine-grained understanding of local geometry details. We thus
propose to utilize the synergies between grasp affordance and 3D reconstruction
through multi-task learning of a shared representation. Our model takes
advantage of deep implicit functions, a continuous and memory-efficient
representation, to enable differentiable training of both tasks. We train the
model on self-supervised grasp trials data in simulation. Evaluation is
conducted on a clutter removal task, where the robot clears cluttered objects
by grasping them one at a time. The experimental results in simulation and on
the real robot have demonstrated that the use of implicit neural
representations and joint learning of grasp affordance and 3D reconstruction
have led to state-of-the-art grasping results. Our method outperforms baselines
by over 10% in terms of grasp success rate. Additional results and videos can

senior care and surgery. Existing fabric manipulation techniques, however, are
designed for specific tasks, making it difficult to generalize across different
but related tasks. We build upon the Visual Foresight framework to learn fabric
dynamics that can be efficiently reused to accomplish different sequential
fabric manipulation tasks with a single goal-conditioned policy. We extend our
earlier work on VisuoSpatial Foresight (VSF), which learns visual dynamics on
domain randomized RGB images and depth maps simultaneously and completely in
simulation. In this earlier work, we evaluated VSF on multi-step fabric
smoothing and folding tasks against 5 baseline methods in simulation and on the
da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) surgical robot without any demonstrations at train
or test time. A key finding was that depth sensing significantly improves
performance: RGBD data yields an 80% improvement in fabric folding success rate
in simulation over pure RGB data. In this work, we vary 4 components of VSF,
including data generation, visual dynamics model, cost function, and
optimization procedure. Results suggest that training visual dynamics models
using longer, corner-based actions can improve the efficiency of fabric folding
by 76% and enable a physical sequential fabric folding task that VSF could not
previously perform with 90% reliability. Code, data, videos, and supplementary

volleyball). The individuals distinct relations are then merged through an

recently. The task is challenging as it requires abstract problem understanding
and symbolic reasoning with axiomatic knowledge. However, current datasets are

Interpretable Geometry Problem Solver (Inter-GPS). Inter-GPS first parses the

parsing and neural object detecting, respectively. Unlike implicit learning in
existing methods, Inter-GPS incorporates theorem knowledge as conditional rules
and performs symbolic reasoning step by step. Also, a theorem predictor is
designed to infer the theorem application sequence fed to the symbolic solver
for the more efficient and reasonable searching path. Extensive experiments on
the Geometry3K and GEOS datasets demonstrate that Inter-GPS achieves
significant improvements over existing methods. The project with code and data

source model degrades when bumping into the high data density near decision
boundary in target domain. A common solution is to minimize the Shannon Entropy
to push the decision boundary away from the high density area. However, entropy
minimization also leads to severe reduction of prediction diversity, and
unfortunately brings harm to the domain adaptation. In this paper, we
investigate the prediction discriminability and diversity by studying the
structure of the classification output matrix of a randomly selected data
batch. We find by theoretical analysis that the prediction discriminability and
diversity could be separately measured by the Frobenius-norm and rank of the
batch output matrix. The nuclear-norm is an upperbound of the former, and a
convex approximation of the latter. Accordingly, we propose Batch Nuclear-norm
Maximization and Minimization, which performs nuclear-norm maximization on the
target output matrix to enhance the target prediction ability, and nuclear-norm
minimization on the source batch output matrix to increase applicability of the
source domain knowledge. We further approximate the nuclear-norm by
L_{1,2}-norm, and design multi-batch optimization for stable solution on large
number of categories. The fast approximation method achieves O(n^2)
computational complexity and better convergence property. Experiments show that
our method could boost the adaptation accuracy and robustness under three
typical domain adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

the sphere, which arises in various machine learning applications such as
orthogonal dictionary learning (ODL) and robust subspace recovery (RSR). The
problem is numerically challenging due to its nonsmooth objective and nonconvex
constraint, and its algorithmic aspects have not been well explored. In this
paper, we show how the manifold structure of the sphere can be exploited to
design fast algorithms for tackling this problem. Specifically, our
contribution is threefold. First, we present a manifold proximal point
algorithm (ManPPA) for the problem and show that it converges at a sublinear
rate. Furthermore, we show that ManPPA can achieve a quadratic convergence rate
when applied to the ODL and RSR problems. Second, we propose a stochastic
variant of ManPPA called StManPPA, which is well suited for large-scale
computation, and establish its sublinear convergence rate. Both ManPPA and
StManPPA have provably faster convergence rates than existing subgradient-type
methods. Third, using ManPPA as a building block, we propose a new approach to
solving a matrix analog of the problem, in which the sphere is replaced by the
Stiefel manifold. The results from our extensive numerical experiments on the
ODL and RSR problems demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our proposed

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Automated image processing approaches are indispensable for many biomedical
experiments and help to cope with the increasing amount of microscopy image
data in a fast and reproducible way. Especially state-of-the-art deep
learning-based approaches most often require large amounts of annotated
training data to produce accurate and generalist outputs, but they are often
compromised by the general lack of those annotated data sets. In this work, we
propose how conditional generative adversarial networks can be utilized to
generate realistic image data for 3D fluorescence microscopy from annotation
masks of 3D cellular structures. In combination with mask simulation
approaches, we demonstrate the generation of fully-annotated 3D microscopy data
sets that we make publicly available for training or benchmarking. An
additional positional conditioning of the cellular structures enables the
reconstruction of position-dependent intensity characteristics and allows to
generate image data of different quality levels. A patch-wise working principle
and a subsequent full-size reassemble strategy is used to generate image data
of arbitrary size and different organisms. We present this as a
proof-of-concept for the automated generation of fully-annotated training data
sets requiring only a minimum of manual interaction to alleviate the need of
manual annotations.]]></summary>

occurrence of a future accident from dashcam videos, which is vital for a
safety-guaranteed self-driving system. To encourage an early and accurate
decision, existing approaches typically focus on capturing the cues of spatial
and temporal context before a future accident occurs. However, their
decision-making lacks visual explanation and ignores the dynamic interaction
with the environment. In this paper, we propose Deep ReInforced accident
anticipation with Visual Explanation, named DRIVE. The method simulates both
the bottom-up and top-down visual attention mechanism in a dashcam observation
environment so that the decision from the proposed stochastic multi-task agent
can be visually explained by attentive regions. Moreover, the proposed dense
anticipation reward and sparse fixation reward are effective in training the
DRIVE model with our improved reinforcement learning algorithm. Experimental
results show that the DRIVE model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
multiple real-world traffic accident datasets. The code and pre-trained model

how users interact with multimodal items is a continuing concern within the
rapid development of recommender systems. The majority of previous work focuses
on modeling user-item interactions with multimodal features included as side
information. However, this scheme is not well-designed for multimedia
recommendation. Specifically, only collaborative item-item relationships are
implicitly modeled through high-order item-user-item relations. Considering
that items are associated with rich contents in multiple modalities, we argue
that the latent semantic item-item structures underlying these multimodal
contents could be beneficial for learning better item representations and
further boosting recommendation. To this end, we propose a LATent sTructure
mining method for multImodal reCommEndation, which we term LATTICE for brevity.
To be specific, in the proposed LATTICE model, we devise a novel modality-aware
structure learning layer, which learns item-item structures for each modality
and aggregates multiple modalities to obtain latent item graphs. Based on the
learned latent graphs, we perform graph convolutions to explicitly inject
high-order item affinities into item representations. These enriched item
representations can then be plugged into existing collaborative filtering
methods to make more accurate recommendations. Extensive experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art multimedia recommendation methods and validate the efficacy of
mining latent item-item relationships from multimodal features.]]></summary>

the mainstream of the existing work still limits their models with a single
prediction space but completely neglects the way to leverage their model with
multi-prediction spaces. This work fills this gap. For the first time, we
deeply study numerous strategies to perform video forecasting in
multi-prediction spaces and fuse their results together to boost performance.
The prediction in the pixel space usually lacks the ability to preserve the
semantic and structure content of the video however the prediction in the
high-level feature space is prone to generate errors in the reduction and
recovering process. Therefore, we build a recurrent connection between
different feature spaces and incorporate their generations in the upsampling
process. Rather surprisingly, this simple idea yields a much more significant
performance boost than PhyDNet (performance improved by 32.1% MAE on MNIST-2
dataset, and 21.4% MAE on KTH dataset). Both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on four datasets demonstrate the generalization ability and
effectiveness of our approach. We show that our model significantly reduces the
troublesome distortions and blurry artifacts and brings remarkable improvements
to the accuracy in long term video prediction. The code will be released soon.]]></summary>

of data and labels, and thus realize conditional generation. Among them,
auxiliary classifier generative adversarial networks (AC-GAN) have been widely
used, but suffer from the issue of low intra-class diversity on generated
samples. In this paper, we point out that the fundamental reason is that the
classifier of AC-GAN is generator-agnostic, and thus cannot provide informative
guidance to the generator to approximate the target joint distribution, leading
to a minimization of conditional entropy that decreases the intra-class
diversity. Based on this finding, we propose novel cGANs with auxiliary
discriminative classifier (ADC-GAN) to address the issue of AC-GAN.
Specifically, the auxiliary discriminative classifier becomes generator-aware
by distinguishing between the real and fake data while recognizing their
labels. We then optimize the generator based on the auxiliary classifier along
with the original discriminator to match the joint and marginal distributions
of the generated samples with those of the real samples. We provide theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence on synthetic and real-world datasets to

but its acquisition speed is quite slow due to the physiological limitations.
Recently, super-resolution methods have shown excellent performance in
accelerating MRI. In some circumstances, it is difficult to obtain
high-resolution images even with prolonged scan time. Therefore, we proposed a
novel super-resolution method that uses a generative adversarial network (GAN)
with cyclic loss and attention mechanism to generate high-resolution MR images
from low-resolution MR images by a factor of 2. We implemented our model on
pelvic images from healthy subjects as training and validation data, while
those data from patients were used for testing. The MR dataset was obtained
using different imaging sequences, including T2, T2W SPAIR, and mDIXON-W. Four
methods, i.e., BICUBIC, SRCNN, SRGAN, and EDSR were used for comparison.
Structural similarity, peak signal to noise ratio, root mean square error, and
variance inflation factor were used as calculation indicators to evaluate the
performances of the proposed method. Various experimental results showed that
our method can better restore the details of the high-resolution MR image as
compared to the other methods. In addition, the reconstructed high-resolution
MR image can provide better lesion textures in the tumor patients, which is
promising to be used in clinical diagnosis.]]></summary>

requires holistic integration of images, scripts, and sounds based on natural
language processing, temporal dependency, and reasoning. Recently, substantial
attempts have been made on several video datasets with associated question
answering (QA) on a large scale. However, existing evaluation metrics for video
question answering (VideoQA) do not provide meaningful analysis. To make
progress, we argue that a well-made framework, established on the way humans
understand, is required to explain and evaluate the performance of
understanding in detail. Then we propose a top-down evaluation system for
VideoQA, based on the cognitive process of humans and story elements: Cognitive
Modules for Evaluation (CogME). CogME is composed of three cognitive modules:
targets, contents, and thinking. The interaction among the modules in the
understanding procedure can be expressed in one sentence as follows: "I
understand the CONTENT of the TARGET through a way of THINKING." Each module
has sub-components derived from the story elements. We can specify the required
aspects of understanding by annotating the sub-components to individual
questions. CogME thus provides a framework for an elaborated specification of
VideoQA datasets. To examine the suitability of a VideoQA dataset for
validating video understanding intelligence, we evaluated the baseline model of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using multimodal neuroimaging data to characterize brain network is currently
an advanced technique for Alzheimer's disease(AD) Analysis. Over recent years
the neuroimaging community has made tremendous progress in the study of
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) derived from
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)
derived from white matter fiber tractography. However, Due to the heterogeneity
and complexity between BOLD signals and fiber tractography, Most existing
multimodal data fusion algorithms can not sufficiently take advantage of the
complementary information between rs-fMRI and DTI. To overcome this problem, a
novel Hypergraph Generative Adversarial Networks(HGGAN) is proposed in this
paper, which utilizes Interactive Hyperedge Neurons module (IHEN) and Optimal
Hypergraph Homomorphism algorithm(OHGH) to generate multimodal connectivity of
Brain Network from rs-fMRI combination with DTI. To evaluate the performance of
this model, We use publicly available data from the ADNI database to
demonstrate that the proposed model not only can identify discriminative brain
regions of AD but also can effectively improve classification performance.]]></summary>

The text router and image router in Dual-Router accept text modal information

generates fused weights for the fusion of experts. Experts are model backbones

we have tested 12 backbones such as Visual BERT on multimodal dataset Hateful

dementia, but small size of complete multimodal data limits the ability in
representation learning. Moreover, the data distribution inconsistency from
different modalities may lead to ineffective fusion, which fails to
sufficiently explore the intra-modal and inter-modal interactions and
compromises the disease diagnosis performance. To solve these problems, we
proposed a novel multimodal representation learning and adversarial hypergraph
fusion (MRL-AHF) framework for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using complete
trimodal images. First, adversarial strategy and pre-trained model are
incorporated into the MRL to extract latent representations from multimodal
data. Then two hypergraphs are constructed from the latent representations and
the adversarial network based on graph convolution is employed to narrow the
distribution difference of hyperedge features. Finally, the hyperedge-invariant
features are fused for disease prediction by hyperedge convolution. Experiments
on the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative(ADNI) database
demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance on Alzheimer's disease
detection compared with other related models and provides a possible way to
understand the underlying mechanisms of disorder's progression by analyzing the

speakers with only a single target-speaker utterance for reference, can be
effectively achieved by speech representation disentanglement. Existing work
generally ignores the correlation between different speech representations
during training, which causes leakage of content information into the speaker
representation and thus degrades VC performance. To alleviate this issue, we
employ vector quantization (VQ) for content encoding and introduce mutual
information (MI) as the correlation metric during training, to achieve proper
disentanglement of content, speaker and pitch representations, by reducing
their inter-dependencies in an unsupervised manner. Experimental results
reflect the superiority of the proposed method in learning effective
disentangled speech representations for retaining source linguistic content and
intonation variations, while capturing target speaker characteristics. In doing
so, the proposed approach achieves higher speech naturalness and speaker
similarity than current state-of-the-art one-shot VC systems. Our code,
pre-trained models and demo are available at

in misinformed conspiracy theories. Yet, they also offer avenues for conspiracy
theorists to express their doubts and experiences of cognitive dissonance. Such
expressions of dissonance may shed light on who abandons misguided beliefs and
under which circumstances. This paper characterizes self-disclosures of
dissonance about QAnon, a conspiracy theory initiated by a mysterious leader Q
and popularized by their followers, anons in conspiracy theory subreddits. To
understand what dissonance and disbelief mean within conspiracy communities, we
first characterize their social imaginaries, a broad understanding of how
people collectively imagine their social existence. Focusing on 2K posts from
two image boards, 4chan and 8chan, and 1.2 M comments and posts from 12
subreddits dedicated to QAnon, we adopt a mixed methods approach to uncover the
symbolic language representing the movement, expectations, practices, heroes
and foes of the QAnon community. We use these social imaginaries to create a
computational framework for distinguishing belief and dissonance from general
discussion about QAnon. Further, analyzing user engagement with QAnon
conspiracy subreddits, we find that self-disclosures of dissonance correlate
with a significant decrease in user contributions and ultimately with their
departure from the community. We contribute a computational framework for
identifying dissonance self-disclosures and measuring the changes in user
engagement surrounding dissonance. Our work can provide insights into designing
dissonance-based interventions that can potentially dissuade conspiracists from
online conspiracy discussion communities.]]></summary>

the \textit{Source} and the \textit{Target} point sets are separated by large

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detecting 3D landmarks on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is crucial to
assessing and quantifying the anatomical abnormalities in 3D cephalometric
analysis. However, the current methods are time-consuming and suffer from large
biases in landmark localization, leading to unreliable diagnosis results. In
this work, we propose a novel Structure-Aware Long Short-Term Memory framework
(SA-LSTM) for efficient and accurate 3D landmark detection. To reduce the
computational burden, SA-LSTM is designed in two stages. It first locates the
coarse landmarks via heatmap regression on a down-sampled CBCT volume and then
progressively refines landmarks by attentive offset regression using
high-resolution cropped patches. To boost accuracy, SA-LSTM captures
global-local dependence among the cropping patches via self-attention.
Specifically, a graph attention module implicitly encodes the landmark's global
structure to rationalize the predicted position. Furthermore, a novel
attention-gated module recursively filters irrelevant local features and
maintains high-confident local predictions for aggregating the final result.
Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy on an in-house dataset and a public
dataset, achieving 1.64 mm and 2.37 mm average errors, respectively, and using
only 0.5 seconds for inferring the whole CBCT volume of resolution 768*768*576.
Moreover, all predicted landmarks are within 8 mm error, which is vital for
acceptable cephalometric analysis.]]></summary>

adapting an encoder-decoder transfer learning method from computer vision to
investigate the structure among 100 different feature spaces extracted from
hidden representations of various networks trained on language tasks. This
method reveals a low-dimensional structure where language models and
translation models smoothly interpolate between word embeddings, syntactic and
semantic tasks, and future word embeddings. We call this low-dimensional
structure a language representation embedding because it encodes the
relationships between representations needed to process language for a variety
of NLP tasks. We find that this representation embedding can predict how well
each individual feature space maps to human brain responses to natural language

of this structure can be used to create a metric which highlights the brain's
natural language processing hierarchy. This suggests that the embedding

musical pieces are spreading much quickly, and music creation is getting much
easier. The increasing number of musical pieces have made the problem of music
plagiarism prominent. There is an urgent need for a tool that can detect music
plagiarism automatically. Researchers have proposed various methods to extract
low-level and high-level features of music and compute their similarities.
However, low-level features such as cepstrum coefficients have weak relation
with the copyright protection of musical pieces. Existing algorithms
considering high-level features fail to detect the case in which two musical
pieces are not quite similar overall, but have some highly similar regions.
This paper proposes a new method named MESMF, which innovatively converts the
music plagiarism detection problem into the bipartite graph matching task. It
can be solved via the maximum weight matching and edit distances model. We
design several kinds of melody representations and the similarity computation
methods according to the music theory. The proposed method can deal with the
shift, swapping, transposition, and tempo variance problems in music
plagiarism. It can also effectively pick out the local similar regions from two
musical pieces with relatively low global similarity. We collect a new music
plagiarism dataset from real legally-judged music plagiarism cases and conduct
detailed ablation studies. Experimental results prove the excellent performance
of the proposed algorithm. The source code and our dataset are available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multimedia content is of predominance in the modern Web era. Investigating
how users interact with multimodal items is a continuing concern within the
rapid development of recommender systems. The majority of previous work focuses
on modeling user-item interactions with multimodal features included as side
information. However, this scheme is not well-designed for multimedia
recommendation. Specifically, only collaborative item-item relationships are
implicitly modeled through high-order item-user-item relations. Considering
that items are associated with rich contents in multiple modalities, we argue
that the latent semantic item-item structures underlying these multimodal
contents could be beneficial for learning better item representations and
further boosting recommendation. To this end, we propose a LATent sTructure
mining method for multImodal reCommEndation, which we term LATTICE for brevity.
To be specific, in the proposed LATTICE model, we devise a novel modality-aware
structure learning layer, which learns item-item structures for each modality
and aggregates multiple modalities to obtain latent item graphs. Based on the
learned latent graphs, we perform graph convolutions to explicitly inject
high-order item affinities into item representations. These enriched item
representations can then be plugged into existing collaborative filtering
methods to make more accurate recommendations. Extensive experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art multimedia recommendation methods and validate the efficacy of
mining latent item-item relationships from multimodal features.]]></summary>

to study linguistic change. This work explores the word rank dynamics of eight
languages by investigating the Google Books corpus unigram frequency data set.
We observed the rank changes of the unigrams from 1900 to 2008 and compared it
to a Wright-Fisher inspired model that we developed for our analysis. The model
simulates a neutral evolutionary process with the restriction of having no
disappearing words. This work explains the mathematical framework of the model
- written as a Markov Chain with multinomial transition probabilities - to show
how frequencies of words change in time. From our observations in the data and
our model, word rank stability shows two types of characteristics: (1) the
increase/decrease in ranks are monotonic, or (2) the average rank stays the
same. Based on our model, high-ranked words tend to be more stable while
low-ranked words tend to be more volatile. Some words change in ranks in two
ways: (a) by an accumulation of small increasing/decreasing rank changes in
time and (b) by shocks of increase/decrease in ranks. Most of the stopwords and
Swadesh words are observed to be stable in ranks across eight languages. These

usage in the studies of radiation-sensitive populations, e.g., pregnant women,
children, and adults that require longitudinal imaging. Reducing the PET
radiotracer dose or acquisition time reduces photon counts, which can
deteriorate image quality. Recent deep-neural-network (DNN) based methods for
image-to-image translation enable the mapping of low-quality PET images
(acquired using substantially reduced dose), coupled with the associated
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, to high-quality PET images. However,
such DNN methods focus on applications involving test data that match the
statistical characteristics of the training data very closely and give little
attention to evaluating the performance of these DNNs on new
out-of-distribution (OOD) acquisitions. We propose a novel DNN formulation that
models the (i) underlying sinogram-based physics of the PET imaging system and
(ii) the uncertainty in the DNN output through the per-voxel heteroscedasticity
of the residuals between the predicted and the high-quality reference images.
Our sinogram-based uncertainty-aware DNN framework, namely, suDNN, estimates a
standard-dose PET image using multimodal input in the form of (i) a
low-dose/low-count PET image and (ii) the corresponding multi-contrast MRI
images, leading to improved robustness of suDNN to OOD acquisitions. Results on
in vivo simultaneous PET-MRI, and various forms of OOD data in PET-MRI, show
the benefits of suDNN over the current state of the art, quantitatively and
qualitatively.]]></summary>

to many medical applications, such as, image enhancement and disease

applications: (i) the latent space projection and reconstruction of unseen real
images, and (ii) style mixing. We demonstrate the 3D-StyleGAN's performance and
feasibility with ~12,000 three-dimensional full brain MR T1 images, although it
can be applied to any 3D volumetric images. Furthermore, we explore different
configurations of hyperparameters to investigate potential improvement of the

to extract causal relations from natural language requirements in fine-grained

between causes and effects. They also do not allow to split causes and effects
into more granular text fragments (e.g., variable and condition), making the
extracted relations unsuitable for automatic test case derivation. [Objective &
Contributions:] We address this research gap and make the following
contributions: First, we present the Causality Treebank, which is the first
corpus of fully labeled binary parse trees representing the composition of
1,571 causal requirements. Second, we propose a fine-grained causality
extractor based on Recursive Neural Tensor Networks. Our approach is capable of
recovering the composition of causal statements written in natural language and

society since a growing number of users use them for information seeking and
decision making. Therefore, it is crucial to address the potential unfairness
problems in recommendations. Just like users have personalized preferences on
items, users' demands for fairness are also personalized in many scenarios.
Therefore, it is important to provide personalized fair recommendations for
users to satisfy their personalized fairness demands. Besides, previous works
on fair recommendation mainly focus on association-based fairness. However, it
is important to advance from associative fairness notions to causal fairness
notions for assessing fairness more properly in recommender systems. Based on
the above considerations, this paper focuses on achieving personalized
counterfactual fairness for users in recommender systems. To this end, we
introduce a framework for achieving counterfactually fair recommendations
through adversary learning by generating feature-independent user embeddings
for recommendation. The framework allows recommender systems to achieve
personalized fairness for users while also covering non-personalized
situations. Experiments on two real-world datasets with shallow and deep
recommendation algorithms show that our method can generate fairer
recommendations for users with a desirable recommendation performance.]]></summary>

speakers with only a single target-speaker utterance for reference, can be
effectively achieved by speech representation disentanglement. Existing work
generally ignores the correlation between different speech representations
during training, which causes leakage of content information into the speaker
representation and thus degrades VC performance. To alleviate this issue, we
employ vector quantization (VQ) for content encoding and introduce mutual
information (MI) as the correlation metric during training, to achieve proper
disentanglement of content, speaker and pitch representations, by reducing
their inter-dependencies in an unsupervised manner. Experimental results
reflect the superiority of the proposed method in learning effective
disentangled speech representations for retaining source linguistic content and
intonation variations, while capturing target speaker characteristics. In doing
so, the proposed approach achieves higher speech naturalness and speaker

significance of our bias-mitigation approach on downstream NLP applications.
Our proposed methods establish the state-of-the-art performance for debiasing

recently. The task is challenging as it requires abstract problem understanding
and symbolic reasoning with axiomatic knowledge. However, current datasets are
either small in scale or not publicly available. Thus, we construct a new
large-scale benchmark, Geometry3K, consisting of 3,002 geometry problems with
dense annotation in formal language. We further propose a novel geometry
solving approach with formal language and symbolic reasoning, called
Interpretable Geometry Problem Solver (Inter-GPS). Inter-GPS first parses the
problem text and diagram into formal language automatically via rule-based text
parsing and neural object detecting, respectively. Unlike implicit learning in
existing methods, Inter-GPS incorporates theorem knowledge as conditional rules
and performs symbolic reasoning step by step. Also, a theorem predictor is
designed to infer the theorem application sequence fed to the symbolic solver
for the more efficient and reasonable searching path. Extensive experiments on
the Geometry3K and GEOS datasets demonstrate that Inter-GPS achieves
significant improvements over existing methods. The project with code and data

to extract causal relations from natural language requirements in fine-grained

between causes and effects. They also do not allow to split causes and effects
into more granular text fragments (e.g., variable and condition), making the

communicating due to social isolation and quarantine. Also, it was the primary
source of misinformation dissemination on a large scale, referred to as the
infodemic. Therefore, automatic debunking misinformation is a crucial problem.
To tackle this problem, we present two COVID-19 related misinformation datasets
on Twitter and propose a misinformation detection system comprising
network-based and content-based processes based on machine learning algorithms
and NLP techniques. In the network-based process, we focus on social
properties, network characteristics, and users. On the other hand, we classify
misinformation using the content of the tweets directly in the content-based
process, which contains text classification models (paragraph-level and
sentence-level) and similarity models. The evaluation results on the
network-based process show the best results for the artificial neural network
model with an F1 score of 88.68%. In the content-based process, our novel
similarity models, which obtained an F1 score of 90.26%, show an improvement in
the misinformation classification results compared to the network-based models.
In addition, in the text classification models, the best result was achieved
using the stacking ensemble-learning model by obtaining an F1 score of 95.18%.
Furthermore, we test our content-based models on the Constraint@AAAI2021
dataset, and by getting an F1 score of 94.38%, we improve the baseline results.
Finally, we develop a fact-checking website called Checkovid that uses each
process to detect misinformative and informative claims in the domain of
COVID-19 from different perspectives.]]></summary>

Key to our approach is the use of Mixup noise to create similar and dissimilar
examples by mixing data samples differently either at the input or hidden-state
levels. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DACL, we conduct experiments across
various domains such as tabular data, images, and graphs. Our results show that
DACL not only outperforms other domain-agnostic noising methods, such as

SimCLR, to improve self-supervised visual representation learning. Finally, we

research path that has already provided promising results for industries.
However, it is impossible to collect enough data to learn all types of faults

conditions only, were developed to perform unsupervised anomaly detection. A
key issue in the development of these algorithms is the noise in the signals,
as it impacts the anomaly detection performance. In this work, we propose a
powerful data-driven and quasi non-parametric denoising strategy for spectral
data based on a tensor decomposition: the Non-negative Canonical Polyadic (CP)
decomposition. This method is particularly adapted for machine emitting
stationary sound. We demonstrate in a case study, the Malfunctioning Industrial
Machine Investigation and Inspection (MIMII) baseline, how the use of our
denoising strategy leads to a sensible improvement of the unsupervised anomaly

microscopy imagery of living cells, based on a past experiment. This novel
generative adversarial network synthesises a multi-domain sequence of
consecutive timesteps. We showcase Multi-StyleGAN on imagery of multiple live
yeast cells in microstructured environments and train on a dataset recorded in
our laboratory. The simulation captures underlying biophysical factors and time
dependencies, such as cell morphology, growth, physical interactions, as well
as the intensity of a fluorescent reporter protein. An immediate application is
to generate additional training and validation data for feature extraction
algorithms or to aid and expedite development of advanced experimental

with variational inference techniques, enable state-of-the-art sparse
approaches to infer GPs at scale through mini batch-based learning. In this
work, we address one limitation of sparse GPs, which is due to the challenge in
dealing with a large number of inducing variables without imposing a special
structure on the inducing inputs. In particular, we introduce a novel
hierarchical prior, which imposes sparsity on the set of inducing variables. We
treat our model variationally, and we experimentally show considerable
computational gains compared to standard sparse GPs when sparsity on the
inducing variables is realized considering the nearest inducing inputs of a
random mini-batch of the data. We perform an extensive experimental validation
that demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach compared to the

language (NL) user queries is an important but under-studied topic. One of the
challenges in pursuing this direction is the lack of annotated data. To address
this issue, we present the Query-based Video Highlights (QVHighlights) dataset.
It consists of over 10,000 YouTube videos, covering a wide range of topics,
from everyday activities and travel in lifestyle vlog videos to social and
political activities in news videos. Each video in the dataset is annotated
with: (1) a human-written free-form NL query, (2) relevant moments in the video
w.r.t. the query, and (3) five-point scale saliency scores for all
query-relevant clips. This comprehensive annotation enables us to develop and
evaluate systems that detect relevant moments as well as salient highlights for
diverse, flexible user queries. We also present a strong baseline for this
task, Moment-DETR, a transformer encoder-decoder model that views moment
retrieval as a direct set prediction problem, taking extracted video and query
representations as inputs and predicting moment coordinates and saliency scores
end-to-end. While our model does not utilize any human prior, we show that it
performs competitively when compared to well-engineered architectures. With
weakly supervised pretraining using ASR captions, Moment-DETR substantially
outperforms previous methods. Lastly, we present several ablations and
visualizations of Moment-DETR. Data and code is publicly available at

models exhibited discrimination among people based on race, sex, age, etc.
Research has been conducted to measure and mitigate unfairness in machine
learning models. For a machine learning task, it is a common practice to build
a pipeline that includes an ordered set of data preprocessing stages followed
by a classifier. However, most of the research on fairness has considered a
single classifier based prediction task. What are the fairness impacts of the
preprocessing stages in machine learning pipeline? Furthermore, studies showed
that often the root cause of unfairness is ingrained in the data itself, rather
than the model. But no research has been conducted to measure the unfairness
caused by a specific transformation made in the data preprocessing stage. In
this paper, we introduced the causal method of fairness to reason about the
fairness impact of data preprocessing stages in ML pipeline. We leveraged
existing metrics to define the fairness measures of the stages. Then we
conducted a detailed fairness evaluation of the preprocessing stages in 37
pipelines collected from three different sources. Our results show that certain
data transformers are causing the model to exhibit unfairness. We identified a
number of fairness patterns in several categories of data transformers.
Finally, we showed how the local fairness of a preprocessing stage composes in
the global fairness of the pipeline. We used the fairness composition to choose
appropriate downstream transformer that mitigates unfairness in the machine
learning pipeline.]]></summary>

and generalization performance of federated learning (FL) when the aggregation
of devices' knowledge occurs in the gradient space. For example, devices may
differ in terms of data distribution, network latency, input/output space,

local gradients. To improve the tolerance to heterogeneity, we propose a novel
federated prototype learning (FedProto) framework in which the devices and
server communicate the class prototypes instead of the gradients. FedProto
aggregates the local prototypes collected from different devices, and then
sends the global prototypes back to all devices to regularize the training of
local models. The training on each device aims to minimize the classification
error on the local data while keeping the resulting local prototypes
sufficiently close to the corresponding global ones. Through experiments, we
propose a benchmark setting tailored for heterogeneous FL, with FedProto
outperforming several recent FL approaches on multiple datasets.]]></summary>

hardware have wide-ranging benefits, depending on the application, from lower
inference latency to higher data throughput and reduced energy consumption. Two
popular techniques for reducing computation in neural networks are pruning,
removing insignificant synapses, and quantization, reducing the precision of
the calculations. In this work, we explore the interplay between pruning and
quantization during the training of neural networks for ultra low latency
applications targeting high energy physics use cases. Techniques developed for
this study have potential applications across many other domains. We study
various configurations of pruning during quantization-aware training, which we
term quantization-aware pruning, and the effect of techniques like
regularization, batch normalization, and different pruning schemes on
performance, computational complexity, and information content metrics. We find
that quantization-aware pruning yields more computationally efficient models
than either pruning or quantization alone for our task. Further,
quantization-aware pruning typically performs similar to or better in terms of
computational efficiency compared to other neural architecture search
techniques like Bayesian optimization. Surprisingly, while networks with
different training configurations can have similar performance for the
benchmark application, the information content in the network can vary
significantly, affecting its generalizability.]]></summary>

effective exploration is only possible with coherent representations.
Furthermore, we would like to learn representations that not only generalize
across tasks but also accelerate downstream exploration for efficient
task-specific training. To address these challenges we propose Proto-RL, a
self-supervised framework that ties representation learning with exploration
through prototypical representations. These prototypes simultaneously serve as
a summarization of the exploratory experience of an agent as well as a basis
for representing observations. We pre-train these task-agnostic representations
and prototypes on environments without downstream task information. This

networks. In this paper, we propose a fully hyperbolic framework to build
hyperbolic networks based on the Lorentz model by adapting the Lorentz
transformations (including boost and rotation) to formalize essential
operations of neural networks. Moreover, we also prove that linear
transformation in tangent spaces used by existing hyperbolic networks is a
relaxation of the Lorentz rotation and does not include the boost, implicitly
limiting the capabilities of existing hyperbolic networks. The experimental

while keeping the training data on the devices. Most FL schemes are
synchronous: they perform a synchronized aggregation of model updates from
individual devices. Synchronous training can be slow because of late-arriving
devices (stragglers). On the other hand, completely asynchronous training makes
FL less private because of incompatibility with secure aggregation. In this
work, we propose a model aggregation scheme, FedBuff, that combines the best
properties of synchronous and asynchronous FL. Similar to synchronous FL,
FedBuff is compatible with secure aggregation. Similar to asynchronous FL,
FedBuff is robust to stragglers. In FedBuff, clients trains asynchronously and
send updates to the server. The server aggregates client updates in a private
buffer until updates have been received, at which point a server model update
is immediately performed. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for
FedBuff in a non-convex setting. Empirically, FedBuff converges up to 3.8x
faster than previous proposals for synchronous FL (e.g., FedAvgM), and up to
2.5x faster than previous proposals for asynchronous FL (e.g., FedAsync). We
show that FedBuff is robust to different staleness distributions and is more

BASE Layers, while requiring no routing parameters or extra terms in the
objective function such as a load balancing loss, and no sophisticated
assignment algorithm. We study the performance of different hashing techniques,
hash sizes and input features, and show that balanced and random hashes focused
on the most local features work best, compared to either learning clusters or
using longer-range context. We show our approach works well both on large
language modeling and dialogue tasks, and on downstream fine-tuning tasks.]]></summary>

advantages for large-scale applications that rely on collaborative learning,
especially when the training data is either unbalanced or inaccessible due to
privacy constraints. We hypothesize that Federated Averaging underestimates the
full extent of heterogeneity of data when the aggregation is performed. We
propose Precision-weighted Federated Learning a novel algorithm that takes into
account the variance of the stochastic gradients when computing the weighted
average of the parameters of models trained in a Federated Learning setting.
With Precision-weighted Federated Learning, we provide an alternate averaging
scheme that leverages the heterogeneity of the data when it has a large
diversity of features in its composition. Our method was evaluated using
standard image classification datasets with two different data partitioning
strategies (IID/non-IID) to measure the performance and speed of our method in
resource-constrained environments, such as mobile and IoT devices. We obtained
a good balance between computational efficiency and convergence rates with
Precision-weighted Federated Learning. Our performance evaluations show 9%
better predictions with MNIST, 18% with Fashion-MNIST, and 5% with CIFAR-10 in
the non-IID setting. Further reliability evaluations ratify the stability in
our method by reaching a 99% reliability index with IID partitions and 96% with
non-IID partitions. In addition, we obtained a 20x speedup on Fashion-MNIST
with only 10 clients and up to 37x with 100 clients participating in the
aggregation concurrently per communication round. The results indicate that
Precision-weighted Federated Learning is an effective and faster alternative
approach for aggregating private data, especially in domains where data is
highly heterogeneous.]]></summary>

methods with the efficiency of conventional force fields. However, current
ML-FFs typically ignore electronic degrees of freedom, such as the total charge
or spin state, and assume chemical locality, which is problematic when
molecules have inconsistent electronic states, or when nonlocal effects play a
significant role. This work introduces SpookyNet, a deep neural network for
constructing ML-FFs with explicit treatment of electronic degrees of freedom
and quantum nonlocality. Chemically meaningful inductive biases and analytical
corrections built into the network architecture allow it to properly model
physical limits. SpookyNet improves upon the current state-of-the-art (or
achieves similar performance) on popular quantum chemistry data sets. Notably,
it is able to generalize across chemical and conformational space and can
leverage the learned chemical insights, e.g. by predicting unknown spin states,
thus helping to close a further important remaining gap for today's machine
learning models in quantum chemistry.]]></summary>

globally shared model through cycles of model aggregation and local model
training, without the need to share data. Most existing FL methods train local
models separately on different clients, and then simply average their
parameters to obtain a centralized model on the server side. However, these
approaches generally suffer from large aggregation errors and severe local
forgetting, which are particularly bad in heterogeneous data settings. To
tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel FL framework that uses
online Laplace approximation to approximate posteriors on both the client and
server side. On the server side, a multivariate Gaussian product mechanism is
employed to construct and maximize a global posterior, largely reducing the
aggregation errors induced by large discrepancies between local models. On the
client side, a prior loss that uses the global posterior probabilistic
parameters delivered from the server is designed to guide the local training.
Binding such learning constraints from other clients enables our method to
mitigate local forgetting. Finally, we achieve state-of-the-art results on
several benchmarks, clearly demonstrating the advantages of the proposed
method.]]></summary>

errors made when reconstructing accelerated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
data.

Methods: Scan-Specific Artifact Reduction in k-space (SPARK) trains a
convolutional-neural-network to estimate and correct k-space errors made by an
input reconstruction technique by back-propagating from the mean-squared-error
loss between an auto-calibration signal (ACS) and the input technique's
reconstructed ACS. First, SPARK is applied to GRAPPA and demonstrates improved
robustness over other scan-specific models, such as RAKI and residual-RAKI.
Subsequent experiments demonstrate that SPARK synergizes with residual-RAKI to
improve reconstruction performance. SPARK also improves reconstruction quality
when applied to advanced acquisition and reconstruction techniques like 2D
virtual coil (VC-) GRAPPA, 2D LORAKS, 3D GRAPPA without an integrated ACS
region, and 2D/3D wave-encoded images.

Results: SPARK yields 1.5x - 2x RMSE reduction when applied to GRAPPA and
improves robustness to ACS size for various acceleration rates in comparison to
other scan-specific techniques. When applied to advanced reconstruction
techniques such as residual-RAKI, 2D VC-GRAPPA and LORAKS, SPARK achieves up to
20% RMSE improvement. SPARK with 3D GRAPPA also improves performance by ~2x and
perceived image quality without a fully sampled ACS region. Finally, SPARK
synergizes with non-cartesian 2D and 3D wave-encoding imaging by reducing RMSE
between 20-25% and providing qualitative improvements.

Conclusion: SPARK synergizes with physics-based acquisition and
reconstruction techniques to improve accelerated MRI by training scan-specific
models to estimate and correct reconstruction errors in k-space.]]></summary>

non-convex, gradient-based methods have been wildly successful at learning
neural networks in practice. This juxtaposition has led to a number of recent

Unfortunately, the techniques in these works are often highly specific to the
problem studied in each setting, relying on different assumptions on the
distribution, optimization parameters, and network architectures, making it
difficult to generalize across different settings. In this work, we propose a
unified non-convex optimization framework for the analysis of neural network
training. We introduce the notions of proxy convexity and proxy
Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequalities, which are satisfied if the original
objective function induces a proxy objective function that is implicitly
minimized when using gradient methods. We show that stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) on objectives satisfying proxy convexity or the proxy PL inequality leads
to efficient guarantees for proxy objective functions. We further show that
many existing guarantees for neural networks trained by gradient descent can be

cause Recurrent Congestion (RC) patterns is crucial for numerous real-world
applications, including urban planning and scheduling of public transportation

overlooked. This article proposes the ST-Discovery algorithm, a novel
unsupervised spatio-temporal data mining algorithm that facilitates the
effective data-driven discovery of RC dependencies induced by the road network
topology using real-world traffic data. We factor out regularly reoccurring
traffic phenomena, such as rush hours, mainly induced by the daytime, by
modelling and systematically exploiting temporal traffic load outliers. We
present an algorithm that first constructs connected subgraphs of the road
network based on the traffic speed outliers. Second, the algorithm identifies
pairs of subgraphs that indicate spatio-temporal correlations in their traffic
load behaviour to identify topological dependencies within the road network.
Finally, we rank the identified subgraph pairs based on the dependency score
determined by our algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate that
ST-Discovery can effectively reveal topological dependencies in urban road

data has a low intrinsic dimension, at least locally. In this work, we consider
the problem of estimating a $d$ dimensional sub-manifold of $\mathbb{R}^D$ from
a finite set of noisy samples. Assuming that the data was sampled uniformly
from a tubular neighborhood of $\mathcal{M}\in \mathcal{C}^k$, a compact
manifold without boundary, we present an algorithm that takes a point $r$ from
the tubular neighborhood and outputs $\hat p_n\in \mathbb{R}^D$, and
$\widehat{T_{\hat p_n}\mathcal{M}}$ an element in the Grassmanian $Gr(d, D)$.
We prove that as the number of samples $n\to\infty$ the point $\hat p_n$
converges to $p\in \mathcal{M}$ and $\widehat{T_{\hat p_n}\mathcal{M}}$
converges to $T_p\mathcal{M}$ (the tangent space at that point) with high
probability. Furthermore, we show that the estimation yields asymptotic rates
of convergence of $n^{-\frac{k}{2k + d}}$ for the point estimation and
$n^{-\frac{k-1}{2k + d}}$ for the estimation of the tangent space. These rates
are known to be optimal for the case of function estimation.]]></summary>

lives and has affected all aspects of human life. This paper focuses on the
application of deep learning (DL) models to medical imaging and drug discovery
for managing COVID-19 disease. In this article, we detail various medical
imaging-based studies such as X-rays and computed tomography (CT) images along
with DL methods for classifying COVID-19 affected versus pneumonia. The
applications of DL techniques to medical images are further described in terms
of image localization, segmentation, registration, and classification leading
to COVID-19 detection. The reviews of recent papers indicate that the highest
classification accuracy of 99.80% is obtained when InstaCovNet-19 DL method is
applied to an X-ray dataset of 361 COVID-19 patients, 362 pneumonia patients
and 365 normal people. Furthermore, it can be seen that the best classification
accuracy of 99.054% can be achieved when EDL_COVID DL method is applied to a CT
image dataset of 7500 samples where COVID-19 patients, lung tumor patients and
normal people are equal in number. Moreover, we illustrate the potential DL
techniques in drug or vaccine discovery in combating the coronavirus. Finally,
we address a number of problems, concerns and future research directions
relevant to DL applications for COVID-19.]]></summary>

perform conditional generation in a completely unsupervised manner. However,
the salient attributes of unlabeled data in the real-world are mostly
imbalanced. Existing unsupervised conditional GANs cannot properly cluster the

the attributes. To address this problem, we theoretically derive Stein latent
optimization that provides reparameterizable gradient estimations of the latent

latent space. Structurally, we introduce an encoder network and a novel
contrastive loss to help generated data from a single mixture component to
represent a single attribute. We confirm that the proposed method, named Stein
Latent Optimization for GANs (SLOGAN), successfully learns the balanced or
imbalanced attributes and performs unsupervised tasks such as unsupervised
conditional generation, unconditional generation, and cluster assignment even
in the absence of information of the attributes (e.g. the imbalance ratio).
Moreover, we demonstrate that the attributes to be learned can be manipulated

zero-shot transfer to a priori unknown test distributions. However, common
evaluation protocols only test a single, fixed data split in which train and
test classes are assigned randomly. More realistic evaluations should consider
a broad spectrum of distribution shifts with potentially varying degree and
difficulty. In this work, we systematically construct train-test splits of
increasing difficulty and present the ooDML benchmark to characterize
generalization under out-of-distribution shifts in DML. ooDML is designed to
probe the generalization performance on much more challenging, diverse
train-to-test distribution shifts. Based on our new benchmark, we conduct a
thorough empirical analysis of state-of-the-art DML methods. We find that while
generalization tends to consistently degrade with difficulty, some methods are
better at retaining performance as the distribution shift increases. Finally,
we propose few-shot DML as an efficient way to consistently improve
generalization in response to unknown test shifts presented in ooDML. Code

certification of deep neural network classifiers at scale. All prior art on
randomized smoothing has focused on isotropic $\ell_p$ certification, which has
the advantage of yielding certificates that can be easily compared among
isotropic methods via $\ell_p$-norm radius. However, isotropic certification
limits the region that can be certified around an input to worst-case
adversaries, i.e., it cannot reason about other "close", potentially large,
constant prediction safe regions. To alleviate this issue, (i) we theoretically
extend the isotropic randomized smoothing $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ certificates to
their generalized anisotropic counterparts following a simplified analysis.
Moreover, (ii) we propose evaluation metrics allowing for the comparison of
general certificates - a certificate is superior to another if it certifies a
superset region - with the quantification of each certificate through the
volume of the certified region. We introduce ANCER, a practical framework for
obtaining anisotropic certificates for a given test set sample via volume
maximization. Our empirical results demonstrate that ANCER achieves
state-of-the-art $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ certified accuracy on both CIFAR-10 and
ImageNet at multiple radii, while certifying substantially larger regions in
terms of volume, thus highlighting the benefits of moving away from isotropic
analysis. Code used in our experiments is available in

have on a machine learning model. To use differential privacy in machine
learning, data scientists must choose privacy parameters $(\epsilon,\delta)$.
Choosing meaningful privacy parameters is key, since models trained with weak
privacy parameters might result in excessive privacy leakage, while strong
privacy parameters might overly degrade model utility. However, privacy
parameter values are difficult to choose for two main reasons. First, the
theoretical upper bound on privacy loss $(\epsilon,\delta)$ might be loose,
depending on the chosen sensitivity and data distribution of practical
datasets. Second, legal requirements and societal norms for anonymization often
refer to individual identifiability, to which $(\epsilon,\delta)$ are only
indirectly related.

We transform $(\epsilon,\delta)$ to a bound on the Bayesian posterior belief
of the adversary assumed by differential privacy concerning the presence of any
record in the training dataset. The bound holds for multidimensional queries
under composition, and we show that it can be tight in practice. Furthermore,
we derive an identifiability bound, which relates the adversary assumed in
differential privacy to previous work on membership inference adversaries. We
formulate an implementation of this differential privacy adversary that allows
data scientists to audit model training and compute empirical identifiability
scores and empirical $(\epsilon,\delta)$.]]></summary>

decomposition, or robust principal component analysis (PCA), has achieved
stunning performance. However, the selection of the parameters of L+S is
empirical, and the acceleration rate is limited, which are common failings of
iterative compressed sensing MR imaging (CS-MRI) reconstruction methods. Many
deep learning approaches have been proposed to address these issues, but few of
them use a low-rank prior. In this paper, a model-based low-rank plus sparse
network, dubbed L+S-Net, is proposed for dynamic MR reconstruction. In
particular, we use an alternating linearized minimization method to solve the
optimization problem with low-rank and sparse regularization. Learned soft
singular value thresholding is introduced to ensure the clear separation of the
L component and S component. Then, the iterative steps are unrolled into a
network in which the regularization parameters are learnable. We prove that the
proposed L+S-Net achieves global convergence under two standard assumptions.
Experiments on retrospective and prospective cardiac cine datasets show that
the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art CS and existing deep learning
methods and has great potential for extremely high acceleration factors (up to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most important lessons from the success of deep learning is that
learned representations tend to perform much better at any task compared to
representations we design by hand. Yet evolution of evolvability algorithms,
which aim to automatically learn good genetic representations, have received
relatively little attention, perhaps because of the large amount of
computational power they require. The recent method Evolvability ES allows
direct selection for evolvability with little computation. However, it can only
be used to solve problems where evolvability and task performance are aligned.
We propose Quality Evolvability ES, a method that simultaneously optimizes for
task performance and evolvability and without this restriction. Our proposed
approach Quality Evolvability has similar motivation to Quality Diversity
algorithms, but with some important differences. While Quality Diversity aims
to find an archive of diverse and well-performing, but potentially genetically
distant individuals, Quality Evolvability aims to find a single individual with
a diverse and well-performing distribution of offspring. By doing so Quality
Evolvability is forced to discover more evolvable representations. We
demonstrate on robotic locomotion control tasks that Quality Evolvability ES,
similarly to Quality Diversity methods, can learn faster than objective-based
methods and can handle deceptive problems.]]></summary>

nondiscrimination are all demanded already by existing law and regulations -
albeit, in many cases, to an uncertain degree. Next, we discuss the underlying
technical challenges, possible ways for addressing them, and their respective
merits and drawbacks. We notice that distribution shift, spurious correlations,
model underspecification, and data scarcity represent severe challenges in the
medical context (and others) that are very difficult to solve with classical
black-box deep neural networks. Important measures that may help to address
these challenges include the use of large and representative datasets and
federated learning as a means to that end, the careful exploitation of domain

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Human activity recognition (HAR) in ubiquitous computing has been beginning
to incorporate attention into the context of deep neural networks (DNNs), in
which the rich sensing data from multimodal sensors such as accelerometer and
gyroscope is used to infer human activities. Recently, two attention methods
are proposed via combining with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) network, which can capture the dependencies of sensing signals in
both spatial and temporal domains simultaneously. However, recurrent networks
often have a weak feature representing power compared with convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). On the other hand, two attention, i.e., hard attention and
soft attention, are applied in temporal domains via combining with CNN, which
pay more attention to the target activity from a long sequence. However, they
can only tell where to focus and miss channel information, which plays an
important role in deciding what to focus. As a result, they fail to address the
spatial-temporal dependencies of multimodal sensing signals, compared with
attention-based GRU or LSTM. In the paper, we propose a novel dual attention
method called DanHAR, which introduces the framework of blending channel

state-of-the-art performance with negligible overhead of parameters.
Furthermore, visualizing analysis is provided to show that our attention can

interpretation of the predictions of machine learning models based on Shapley
values. While exact calculation of SHAP values is computationally intractable
in general, a recursive polynomial-time algorithm called TreeShap is available
for decision tree models. However, despite its polynomial time complexity,
TreeShap can become a significant bottleneck in practical machine learning
pipelines when applied to large decision tree ensembles. We present
GPUTreeShap, a modified TreeShap algorithm suitable for massively parallel
computation on graphics processing units. Our approach first preprocesses each
decision tree to isolate variable sized sub-problems from the original
recursive algorithm, then solves a bin packing problem, and finally maps
sub-problems to single-instruction, multiple-thread (SIMT) tasks for parallel
execution with specialised hardware instructions. With a single NVIDIA Tesla
V100-32 GPU, we achieve speedups of up to 19x for SHAP values, and speedups of
up to 340x for SHAP interaction values, over a state-of-the-art multi-core CPU
implementation executed on two 20-core Xeon E5-2698 v4 2.2 GHz CPUs. We also
experiment with multi-GPU computing using eight V100 GPUs, demonstrating
throughput of 1.2M rows per second -- equivalent CPU-based performance is
estimated to require 6850 CPU cores.]]></summary>

handful of samples at test time, which has been predominantly tackled with the
idea of meta-learning. However, meta-learning approaches essentially learn
across a variety of few-shot tasks and thus still require large-scale training
data with fine-grained supervision to derive a generalized model, thereby
involving prohibitive annotation cost. In this paper, we advance the few-shot
classification paradigm towards a more challenging scenario, i.e.,
cross-granularity few-shot classification, where the model observes only coarse
labels during training while is expected to perform fine-grained classification
during testing. This task largely relieves the annotation cost since
fine-grained labeling usually requires strong domain-specific expertise. To
bridge the cross-granularity gap, we approximate the fine-grained data
distribution by greedy clustering of each coarse-class into pseudo-fine-classes
according to the similarity of image embeddings. We then propose a
meta-embedder that jointly optimizes the visual- and semantic-discrimination,
in both instance-wise and coarse class-wise, to obtain a good feature space for
this coarse-to-fine pseudo-labeling process. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our
approach on three representative datasets.]]></summary>

millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless communications. To address this issue, in
this paper, we propose a wide beam based training approach to calibrate the
narrow beam direction according to the channel power leakage. To handle the
complex nonlinear properties of the channel power leakage, deep learning is
utilized to predict the optimal narrow beam directly. Specifically, three deep
learning assisted calibrated beam training schemes are proposed. The first
scheme adopts convolution neural network to implement the prediction based on
the instantaneous received signals of wide beam training. We also perform the
additional narrow beam training based on the predicted probabilities for
further beam direction calibrations. However, the first scheme only depends on
one wide beam training, which lacks the robustness to noise. To tackle this
problem, the second scheme adopts long-short term memory (LSTM) network for
tracking the movement of users and calibrating the beam direction according to
the received signals of prior beam training, in order to enhance the robustness
to noise. To further reduce the overhead of wide beam training, our third
scheme, an adaptive beam training strategy, selects partial wide beams to be
trained based on the prior received signals. Two criteria, namely, optimal
neighboring criterion and maximum probability criterion, are designed for the
selection. Furthermore, to handle mobile scenarios, auxiliary LSTM is
introduced to calibrate the directions of the selected wide beams more
precisely. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed schemes achieve
significantly higher beamforming gain with smaller beam training overhead
compared with the conventional and existing deep-learning based counterparts.]]></summary>

to measure the total power consumption of a building. Using an energy
disaggregation method, the consumption of individual appliances can be
estimated from the aggregate measurement. Recent disaggregation algorithms have
significantly improved the performance of NILM systems. However, the
generalization capability of these methods to different houses as well as the
disaggregation of multi-state appliances are still major challenges. In this
paper we address these issues and propose an energy disaggregation approach
based on the variational autoencoders framework. The probabilistic encoder
makes this approach an efficient model for encoding information relevant to the
reconstruction of the target appliance consumption. In particular, the proposed
model accurately generates more complex load profiles, thus improving the power
signal reconstruction of multi-state appliances. Moreover, its regularized
latent space improves the generalization capabilities of the model across
different houses. The proposed model is compared to state-of-the-art NILM
approaches on the UK-DALE and REFIT datasets, and yields competitive results.
The mean absolute error reduces by 18% on average across all appliances
compared to the state-of-the-art. The F1-Score increases by more than 11%,
showing improvements for the detection of the target appliance in the aggregate
measurement.]]></summary>

knowing what those goals are? Generic reinforcement learning agents could be
trained to behave altruistically towards others by rewarding them for
altruistic behaviour, i.e., rewarding them for benefiting other agents in a
given situation. Such an approach assumes that other agents' goals are known so
that the altruistic agent can cooperate in achieving those goals. However,
explicit knowledge of other agents' goals is often difficult to acquire. Even
assuming such knowledge to be given, training of altruistic agents would
require manually-tuned external rewards for each new environment. Thus, it is
beneficial to develop agents that do not depend on external supervision and can
learn altruistic behaviour in a task-agnostic manner. Assuming that other
agents rationally pursue their goals, we hypothesize that giving them more
choices will allow them to pursue those goals better. Some concrete examples
include opening a door for others or safeguarding them to pursue their
objectives without interference. We formalize this concept and propose an
altruistic agent that learns to increase the choices another agent has by
maximizing the number of states that the other agent can reach in its future.
We evaluate our approach on three different multi-agent environments where
another agent's success depends on the altruistic agent's behaviour. Finally,
we show that our unsupervised agents can perform comparably to agents
explicitly trained to work cooperatively. In some cases, our agents can even
outperform the supervised ones.]]></summary>

results of iterative algorithms on a large portion of the D4RL benchmark. The
simple one-step baseline achieves this strong performance without many of the
tricks used by previously proposed iterative algorithms and is more robust to

approaches is a result of the high variance inherent in doing off-policy

the predicted top probability does not reflect the actual accuracy, and tends
to be over-confident. It is commonly believed that such over-confidence is
mainly due to over-parametrization, in particular when the model is large
enough to memorize the training data and maximize the confidence.

In this paper, we show theoretically that over-parametrization is not the
only reason for over-confidence. We prove that logistic regression is
inherently over-confident, in the realizable, under-parametrized setting where
the data is generated from the logistic model, and the sample size is much
larger than the number of parameters. Further, this over-confidence happens for
general well-specified binary classification problems as long as the activation
is symmetric and concave on the positive part. Perhaps surprisingly, we also
show that over-confidence is not always the case -- there exists another
activation function (and a suitable loss function) under which the learned
classifier is under-confident at some probability values. Overall, our theory
provides a precise characterization of calibration in realizable binary

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sparse coding is a class of unsupervised methods for learning a sparse
representation of the input data in the form of a linear combination of a
dictionary and a sparse code. This learning framework has led to
state-of-the-art results in various image and video processing tasks. However,
classical methods learn the dictionary and the sparse code based on alternating
optimizations, usually without theoretical guarantees for either optimality or
convergence due to non-convexity of the problem. Recent works on sparse coding
with a complete dictionary provide strong theoretical guarantees thanks to the
development of the non-convex optimization. However, initial non-convex
approaches learn the dictionary in the sparse coding problem sequentially in an
atom-by-atom manner, which leads to a long execution time. More recent works
seek to directly learn the entire dictionary at once, which substantially
reduces the execution time. However, the associated recovery performance is
degraded with a finite number of data samples. In this paper, we propose an
efficient sparse coding scheme with a two-stage optimization. The proposed
scheme leverages the global and local Riemannian geometry of the two-stage
optimization problem and facilitates fast implementation for superb dictionary
recovery performance by a finite number of samples without atom-by-atom
calculation. We further prove that, with high probability, the proposed scheme
can exactly recover any atom in the target dictionary with a finite number of
samples if it is adopted to recover one atom of the dictionary. An application
on wireless sensor data compression is also proposed. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world data verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the
proposed scheme.]]></summary>

improve the band-utilization efficiency via spectrum sharing or hardware
sharing between radar and communication systems. Since a common radio resource
budget is shared by both functionalities, there exists a tradeoff between the
sensing and communication performance. However, this tradeoff curve is
currently unknown in ISAC systems with human motion recognition tasks based on
deep learning. To fill this gap, this paper formulates and solves a
multi-objective optimization problem which simultaneously maximizes the
recognition accuracy and the communication data rate. The key ingredient of
this new formulation is a nonlinear recognition accuracy model with respect to
the wireless resources, where the model is derived from power function
regression of the system performance of the deep spectrogram network. To avoid
cost-expensive data collection procedures, a primitive-based autoregressive
hybrid (PBAH) channel model is developed, which facilitates efficient training
and testing dataset generation for human motion recognition in a virtual
environment. Extensive results demonstrate that the proposed wireless
recognition accuracy and PBAH channel models match the actual experimental data
very well. Moreover, it is found that the accuracy-rate region consists of a
communication saturation zone, a sensing saturation zone, and a
communication-sensing adversarial zone, of which the third zone achieves the
desirable balanced performance for ISAC systems.]]></summary>

tasks with orders of magnitude less data than standard RL, but meta-training
itself is costly and time-consuming. If we can meta-train on offline data, then
we can reuse the same static dataset, labeled once with rewards for different
tasks, to meta-train policies that adapt to a variety of new tasks at meta-test
time. Although this capability would make meta-RL a practical tool for
real-world use, offline meta-RL presents additional challenges beyond online
meta-RL or standard offline RL settings. Meta-RL learns an exploration strategy
that collects data for adapting, and also meta-trains a policy that quickly
adapts to data from a new task. Since this policy was meta-trained on a fixed,
offline dataset, it might behave unpredictably when adapting to data collected
by the learned exploration strategy, which differs systematically from the
offline data and thus induces distributional shift. We do not want to remove
this distributional shift by simply adopting a conservative exploration
strategy, because learning an exploration strategy enables an agent to collect
better data for faster adaptation. Instead, we propose a hybrid offline meta-RL
algorithm, which uses offline data with rewards to meta-train an adaptive
policy, and then collects additional unsupervised online data, without any
reward labels to bridge this distribution shift. By not requiring reward labels
for online collection, this data can be much cheaper to collect. We compare our
method to prior work on offline meta-RL on simulated robot locomotion and
manipulation tasks and find that using additional unsupervised online data
collection leads to a dramatic improvement in the adaptive capabilities of the
meta-trained policies, matching the performance of fully online meta-RL on a
range of challenging domains that require generalization to new tasks.]]></summary>

consistency theory for R\'enyi divergence estimators. By applying this theory
to neural-network estimators, we show that if a neural network family satisfies
one of several strengthened versions of the universal approximation property
then the corresponding R\'enyi divergence estimator is consistent. In contrast
to density-estimator based methods, our estimators involve only expectations
under $Q$ and $P$ and hence are more effective in high dimensional systems. We
illustrate this via several numerical examples of neural network estimation in

$\smash{\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\theta(G) T})}$ with adversarial losses;
$\mathcal{O}(\theta(G)\operatorname{polylog}{T})$ with stochastic losses; and
$\mathcal{O}(\theta(G)\operatorname{polylog}{T} + \smash{\sqrt{\theta(G) C})}$

$\theta(G)$ is the clique covering number of the graph $G$. Our algorithm is an
instantiation of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader with a novel regularization that
can be seen as a product of a Tsallis entropy component (inspired by Zimmert

stochastic case by Amir et al. (2020)), thus subtly interpolating between the
two forms of entropies. One of our key technical contributions is in

led to an outburst in the amount of data stored digitally. Consequently,
several retrieval systems have been developed depending on the type of data

search for 3D models is non-trivial. Among 3D models, retrieving 3D
Engineering/CAD models or mechanical components is even more challenging due to
the presence of holes, volumetric features, presence of sharp edges etc., which
make CAD a domain unto itself. The research work presented in this paper aims
at developing a dataset suitable for building a retrieval system for 3D CAD
models based on deep learning. 3D CAD models from the available CAD databases
are collected, and a dataset of computer-generated sketch data, termed
'CADSketchNet', has been prepared. Additionally, hand-drawn sketches of the
components are also added to CADSketchNet. Using the sketch images from this
dataset, the paper also aims at evaluating the performance of various retrieval

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[End-to-end text-spotting, which aims to integrate detection and recognition
in a unified framework, has attracted increasing attention due to its
simplicity of the two complimentary tasks. It remains an open problem
especially when processing arbitrarily-shaped text instances. Previous methods
can be roughly categorized into two groups: character-based and
segmentation-based, which often require character-level annotations and/or
complex post-processing due to the unstructured output. Here, we tackle
end-to-end text spotting by presenting Adaptive Bezier Curve Network v2 (ABCNet
v2). Our main contributions are four-fold: 1) For the first time, we adaptively
fit arbitrarily-shaped text by a parameterized Bezier curve, which, compared
with segmentation-based methods, can not only provide structured output but
also controllable representation. 2) We design a novel BezierAlign layer for
extracting accurate convolution features of a text instance of arbitrary
shapes, significantly improving the precision of recognition over previous
methods. 3) Different from previous methods, which often suffer from complex
post-processing and sensitive hyper-parameters, our ABCNet v2 maintains a
simple pipeline with the only post-processing non-maximum suppression (NMS). 4)
As the performance of text recognition closely depends on feature alignment,
ABCNet v2 further adopts a simple yet effective coordinate convolution to
encode the position of the convolutional filters, which leads to a considerable
improvement with negligible computation overhead. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on various bilingual (English and Chinese) benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ABCNet v2 can achieve state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining very high efficiency.]]></summary>

stability from an initial structured signal. In multiple signal domains it has
been shown to yield more discriminative representations compared to other
non-learned representations, and to outperform learned representations in
certain tasks, particularly on limited labeled data and highly structured
signals. The wavelet filters used in the scattering transform are typically
selected to create a tight frame via a parameterized mother wavelet. Focusing
on Morlet wavelets, we propose to instead adapt the scales, orientations, and
slants of the filters to produce problem-specific parametrizations of the
scattering transform. We show that our learned versions of the scattering
transform yield significant performance gains over the standard scattering
transform in the small sample classification settings, and our empirical
results suggest that tight frames may not always be necessary for scattering
transforms to extract effective representations.]]></summary>

for future machine learning systems due to its privacy preservation and
communication efficiency. In beyond-5G/6G systems, it is likely to have
multiple FL groups with different learning purposes. This scenario leads to a
question: How does a wireless network support multiple FL groups? As an answer,
we first propose to use a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) network to guarantee the stable operation of multiple FL processes by
letting the iterations of these FL processes be executed together within a
large-scale coherence time. We then develop a novel scheme that asynchronously
executes the iterations of FL processes under multicasting downlink and
conventional uplink transmission protocols. Finally, we propose a
simple/low-complexity resource allocation algorithm which optimally chooses the
power and computation resources to minimize the execution time of each
iteration of each FL process.]]></summary>

attacks. The adversary can easily change the outputs of DNNs by adding small
well-designed perturbations to inputs. Adversarial example detection is a
fundamental work for robust DNNs-based service. Adversarial examples show the
difference between humans and DNNs in image recognition. From a human-centric
perspective, image features could be divided into dominant features that are
comprehensible to humans, and recessive features that are incomprehensible to
humans, yet are exploited by DNNs. In this paper, we reveal that imperceptible
adversarial examples are the product of recessive features misleading neural
networks, and an adversarial attack is essentially a kind of method to enrich
these recessive features in the image. The imperceptibility of the adversarial
examples indicates that the perturbations enrich recessive features, yet hardly
affect dominant features. Therefore, adversarial examples are sensitive to
filtering off recessive features, while benign examples are immune to such
operation. Inspired by this idea, we propose a label-only adversarial detection
approach that is referred to as feature-filter. Feature-filter utilizes
discrete cosine transform to approximately separate recessive features from
dominant features, and gets a mutant image that is filtered off recessive
features. By only comparing DNN's prediction labels on the input and its
mutant, feature-filter can real-time detect imperceptible adversarial examples
at high accuracy and few false positives.]]></summary>

patient age and the radiographic finding of lung lesion, pneumothorax or

misclassification for some chest x-ray models. Second, we develop
misclassification predictors on chest x-ray models using their outputs and
clinical features. We find that our best performing misclassification

our misclassification identifiers, we develop a corrective algorithm to
selectively flip model predictions that have high likelihood of
misclassification at inference time. We observe F1 improvement on the
prediction of Consolidation (0.008 [95% CI 0.005, 0.010]) and Edema (0.003,

specific instance of an algorithmic problem class, such as the Boolean
satisfiability problem, is called instance-specific algorithm selection. Over

a number of different methods for algorithm selection. Although most of these
methods are based on machine learning, surprisingly little work has been done
on meta learning, that is, on taking advantage of the complementarity of
existing algorithm selection methods in order to combine them into a single
superior algorithm selector. In this paper, we introduce the problem of meta
algorithm selection, which essentially asks for the best way to combine a given
set of algorithm selectors. We present a general methodological framework for
meta algorithm selection as well as several concrete learning methods as
instantiations of this framework, essentially combining ideas of meta learning
and ensemble learning. In an extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate
that ensembles of algorithm selectors can significantly outperform single
algorithm selectors and have the potential to form the new state of the art in
algorithm selection.]]></summary>

methods are mostly based on two-stage frameworks, which include top-down and
bottom-up methods. Two-stage methods either suffer from high computational
redundancy for additional person detectors or they need to group keypoints
heuristically after predicting all the instance-agnostic keypoints. The
single-stage paradigm aims to simplify the multi-person pose estimation
pipeline and receives a lot of attention. However, recent single-stage methods
have the limitation of low performance due to the difficulty of regressing
various full-body poses from a single feature vector. Different from previous
solutions that involve complex heuristic designs, we present a simple yet
effective solution by employing instance-aware dynamic networks. Specifically,
we propose an instance-aware module to adaptively adjust (part of) the network
parameters for each instance. Our solution can significantly increase the
capacity and adaptive-ability of the network for recognizing various poses,
while maintaining a compact end-to-end trainable pipeline. Extensive

but often sacrifice interpretability and computational efficiency.
Interpretability is crucial in many disciplines, such as science and medicine,
where models must be carefully vetted or where interpretation is the goal
itself. Moreover, interpretable models are concise and often yield
computational efficiency. Here, we propose adaptive wavelet distillation (AWD),
a method which aims to distill information from a trained neural network into a
wavelet transform. Specifically, AWD penalizes feature attributions of a neural
network in the wavelet domain to learn an effective multi-resolution wavelet
transform. The resulting model is highly predictive, concise, computationally
efficient, and has properties (such as a multi-scale structure) which make it
easy to interpret. In close collaboration with domain experts, we showcase how
AWD addresses challenges in two real-world settings: cosmological parameter
inference and molecular-partner prediction. In both cases, AWD yields a
scientifically interpretable and concise model which gives predictive
performance better than state-of-the-art neural networks. Moreover, AWD
identifies predictive features that are scientifically meaningful in the
context of respective domains. All code and models are released in a

impressive results in various regression and classification tasks. However, to
achieve these results, there is a high demand for computing and storing
resources. This becomes problematic when, for instance, real-time, mobile
applications are considered, in which the involved (embedded) devices have
limited resources. A common way of addressing this problem is to transform the
original large pre-trained networks into new smaller models, by utilizing Model
Compression and Acceleration (MCA) techniques. Within the MCA framework, we
propose a clustering-based approach that is able to increase the number of
employed centroids/representatives, while at the same time, have an
acceleration gain compared to conventional, $k$-means based approaches. This is
achieved by imposing a special structure to the employed representatives, which
is enabled by the particularities of the problem at hand. Moreover, the
theoretical acceleration gains are presented and the key system
hyper-parameters that affect that gain, are identified. Extensive evaluation
studies carried out using various state-of-the-art DNN models trained in image
classification, validate the superiority of the proposed method as compared for
its use in MCA tasks.]]></summary>

conditionally automated driving. One of the critical factors that quantifies
the safe takeover transition is takeover time. Previous studies identified the
effects of many factors on takeover time, such as takeover lead time,
non-driving tasks, modalities of the takeover requests (TORs), and scenario
urgency. However, there is a lack of research to predict takeover time by
considering these factors all at the same time. Toward this end, we used
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to predict the takeover time using a
dataset from a meta-analysis study [1]. In addition, we used SHAP (SHapley
Additive exPlanation) to analyze and explain the effects of the predictors on
takeover time. We identified seven most critical predictors that resulted in
the best prediction performance. Their main effects and interaction effects on
takeover time were examined. The results showed that the proposed approach
provided both good performance and explainability. Our findings have
implications on the design of in-vehicle monitoring and alert systems to
facilitate the interaction between the drivers and the automated vehicle.]]></summary>

across all industries, such as disease diagnosis in healthcare or quality
assurance in manufacturing. Manual inspection of images, when extended over a
monotonously repetitive period of time is very time consuming and can lead to
anomalies being overlooked.Artificial neural networks have proven themselves
very successful on simple, repetitive tasks, in some cases even outperforming
humans. Therefore, in this paper we investigate different methods of deep
learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, for anomaly detection
applied to a quality assurance use case. We utilize the MVTec anomaly dataset
and develop three different models, a CNN for supervised anomaly detection,
KD-CAE for autoencoder anomaly detection, NI-CAE for noise induced anomaly
detection and a DCGAN for generating reconstructed images. By experiments, we
found that KD-CAE performs better on the anomaly datasets compared to CNN and
NI-CAE, with NI-CAE performing the best on the Transistor dataset. We also
implemented a DCGAN for the creation of new training data but due to
computational limitation and lack of extrapolating the mechanics of AnoGAN, we
restricted ourselves just to the generation of GAN based images. We conclude
that unsupervised methods are more powerful for anomaly detection in images,
especially in a setting where only a small amount of anomalous data is
available, or the data is unlabeled.]]></summary>

certification of deep neural network classifiers at scale. All prior art on
randomized smoothing has focused on isotropic $\ell_p$ certification, which has
the advantage of yielding certificates that can be easily compared among
isotropic methods via $\ell_p$-norm radius. However, isotropic certification
limits the region that can be certified around an input to worst-case
adversaries, i.e., it cannot reason about other "close", potentially large,
constant prediction safe regions. To alleviate this issue, (i) we theoretically
extend the isotropic randomized smoothing $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ certificates to
their generalized anisotropic counterparts following a simplified analysis.
Moreover, (ii) we propose evaluation metrics allowing for the comparison of
general certificates - a certificate is superior to another if it certifies a
superset region - with the quantification of each certificate through the
volume of the certified region. We introduce ANCER, a practical framework for
obtaining anisotropic certificates for a given test set sample via volume
maximization. Our empirical results demonstrate that ANCER achieves
state-of-the-art $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ certified accuracy on both CIFAR-10 and
ImageNet at multiple radii, while certifying substantially larger regions in
terms of volume, thus highlighting the benefits of moving away from isotropic
analysis. Code used in our experiments is available in

recognition, it is still a challenging task to design a calibration-free
system, since there exists a significant variability of EEG signals among
different subjects and recording sessions. As deep learning has received much
research attention in recent years, many efforts have been made to use deep
learning methods for EEG signal recognition. However, existing works mostly
treat deep learning models as blackbox classifiers, while what have been
learned by the models and to which extent they are affected by the noise from
EEG data are still underexplored. In this paper, we develop a novel
convolutional neural network that can explain its decision by highlighting the
local areas of the input sample that contain important information for the
classification. The network has a compact structure for ease of interpretation
and takes advantage of separable convolutions to process the EEG signals in a
spatial-temporal sequence. Results show that the model achieves an average
accuracy of 78.35% on 11 subjects for leave-one-out cross-subject drowsiness
recognition, which is higher than the conventional baseline methods of
53.4%-72.68% and state-of-art deep learning methods of 63.90%-65.61%.
Visualization results show that the model has learned to recognize biologically
explainable features from EEG signals, e.g., Alpha spindles, as strong
indicators of drowsiness across different subjects. In addition, we also
explore reasons behind some wrongly classified samples and how the model is
affected by artifacts and noise in the data. Our work illustrates a promising
direction on using interpretable deep learning models to discover meaning
patterns related to different mental states from complex EEG signals.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising technology to
enable artificial intelligence (AI) at the network edge, where distributed
mobile devices collaboratively train a shared AI model under the coordination
of an edge server. To significantly improve the communication efficiency of FL,
over-the-air computation allows a large number of mobile devices to
concurrently upload their local models by exploiting the superposition property
of wireless multi-access channels. Due to wireless channel fading, the model
aggregation error at the edge server is dominated by the weakest channel among
all devices, causing severe straggler issues. In this paper, we propose a
relay-assisted cooperative FL scheme to effectively address the straggler
issue. In particular, we deploy multiple half-duplex relays to cooperatively
assist the devices in uploading the local model updates to the edge server. The
nature of the over-the-air computation poses system objectives and constraints
that are distinct from those in traditional relay communication systems.
Moreover, the strong coupling between the design variables renders the
optimization of such a system challenging. To tackle the issue, we propose an
alternating-optimization-based algorithm to optimize the transceiver and relay
operation with low complexity. Then, we analyze the model aggregation error in
a single-relay case and show that our relay-assisted scheme achieves a smaller
error than the one without relays provided that the relay transmit power and
the relay channel gains are sufficiently large. The analysis provides critical
insights on relay deployment in the implementation of cooperative FL. Extensive
numerical results show that our design achieves faster convergence compared
with state-of-the-art schemes.]]></summary>

Photoplethysmogram (PPG), and Skin Temperature (ST) sensors embedded in a smart
wristband for detecting physiological stress. The stress detection model is
trained and tested using stress labels obtained from salivary cortisol which is
a clinically established biomarker for physiological stress. A voice-based

integration in a smart home environment is analyzed by simulating a data
acquisition and streaming scenario. We have also proposed a blood pressure
estimation model using PPG signal and advanced regression techniques for
integration with the stress detection model in the wearable health monitoring
system. Finally, the design of a voice-assisted indoor location system is
proposed for integration with the proposed system within a smart home

a critical problem in a variety of domains, including operations research,
informatics, and material design. Yet, current techniques either require
extremely high iteration counts or a large number of random restarts for good
performance. In this work, we propose adapting recent developments in
meta-learning to these many-minima problems by learning the optimization
algorithm for various loss landscapes. We focus on problems from atomic
structural optimization--finding low energy configurations of many-atom
systems--including widely studied models such as bimetallic clusters and
disordered silicon. We find that our optimizer learns a 'hopping' behavior
which enables efficient exploration and improves the rate of low energy minima
discovery. Finally, our learned optimizers show promising generalization with
efficiency gains on never before seen tasks (e.g. new elements or
compositions). Code will be made available shortly.]]></summary>

has achieved great success in learning visual representations without data
annotations. However, most of methods mainly focus on the instance level
information (\ie, the different augmented images of the same instance should
have the same feature or cluster into the same class), but there is a lack of
attention on the relationships between different instances. In this paper, we
introduced a novel SSL paradigm, which we term as relational self-supervised
learning (ReSSL) framework that learns representations by modeling the
relationship between different instances. Specifically, our proposed method
employs sharpened distribution of pairwise similarities among different
instances as \textit{relation} metric, which is thus utilized to match the
feature embeddings of different augmentations. Moreover, to boost the
performance, we argue that weak augmentations matter to represent a more
reliable relation, and leverage momentum strategy for practical efficiency.
Experimental results show that our proposed ReSSL significantly outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both performance and training
efficiency. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/KyleZheng1997/ReSSL}.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The success of deep neural networks in real-world problems has prompted many
attempts to explain their training dynamics and generalization performance, but
more guiding principles for the training of neural networks are still needed.
Motivated by the edge of chaos principle behind the optimal performance of
neural networks, we study the role of various hyperparameters in modern neural
network training algorithms in terms of the order-chaos phase diagram. In
particular, we study a fully analytical feedforward neural network trained on
the widely adopted Fashion-MNIST dataset, and study the dynamics associated
with the hyperparameters in back-propagation during the training process. We
find that for the basic algorithm of stochastic gradient descent with momentum,
in the range around the commonly used hyperparameter values, clear scaling
relations are present with respect to the training time during the ordered
phase in the phase diagram, and the model's optimal generalization power at the
edge of chaos is similar across different training parameter combinations. In
the chaotic phase, the same scaling no longer exists. The scaling allows us to
choose the training parameters to achieve faster training without sacrificing
performance. In addition, we find that the commonly used model regularization
method - weight decay - effectively pushes the model towards the ordered phase
to achieve better performance. Leveraging on this fact and the scaling
relations in the other hyperparameters, we derived a principled guideline for
hyperparameter determination, such that the model can achieve optimal
performance by saturating it at the edge of chaos. Demonstrated on this simple
neural network model and training algorithm, our work improves the
understanding of neural network training dynamics, and can potentially be
extended to guiding principles of more complex model architectures and
algorithms.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to the high communication cost in distributed and federated learning,
methods relying on compressed communication are becoming increasingly popular.
Besides, the best theoretically and practically performing gradient-type
methods invariably rely on some form of acceleration/momentum to reduce the
number of communications (faster convergence), e.g., Nesterov's accelerated
gradient descent (Nesterov, 2004) and Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014). In order to
combine the benefits of communication compression and convergence acceleration,
we propose a \emph{compressed and accelerated} gradient method for distributed
optimization, which we call CANITA. Our CANITA achieves the \emph{first
accelerated rate}
$O\bigg(\sqrt{\Big(1+\sqrt{\frac{\omega^3}{n}}\Big)\frac{L}{\epsilon}} +
\omega\big(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\big)^{\frac{1}{3}}\bigg)$, which improves upon
the state-of-the-art non-accelerated rate
$O\left((1+\frac{\omega}{n})\frac{L}{\epsilon} +
\frac{\omega^2+n}{\omega+n}\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ of DIANA (Khaled et al.,
2020b) for distributed general convex problems, where $\epsilon$ is the target
error, $L$ is the smooth parameter of the objective, $n$ is the number of
machines/devices, and $\omega$ is the compression parameter (larger $\omega$
means more compression can be applied, and no compression implies $\omega=0$).
Our results show that as long as the number of devices $n$ is large (often true
in distributed/federated learning), or the compression $\omega$ is not very
high, CANITA achieves the faster convergence rate
$O\Big(\sqrt{\frac{L}{\epsilon}}\Big)$, i.e., the number of communication
rounds is $O\Big(\sqrt{\frac{L}{\epsilon}}\Big)$ (vs.
$O\big(\frac{L}{\epsilon}\big)$ achieved by previous works). As a result,
CANITA enjoys the advantages of both compression (compressed communication in
each round) and acceleration (much fewer communication rounds).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success for cognitive
applications. The core operation in a DNN is the dot product between quantized
inputs and weights. Prior works exploit the weight/input repetition that arises
due to quantization to avoid redundant computations in Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). However, in this paper we show that their effectiveness is
severely limited when applied to Fully-Connected (FC) layers, which are
commonly used in state-of-the-art DNNs, as it is the case of modern Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformer models.

To improve energy-efficiency of FC computation we present CREW, a hardware
accelerator that implements Computation Reuse and an Efficient Weight Storage
mechanism to exploit the large number of repeated weights in FC layers. CREW
first performs the multiplications of the unique weights by their respective
inputs and stores the results in an on-chip buffer. The storage requirements
are modest due to the small number of unique weights and the relatively small
size of the input compared to convolutional layers. Next, CREW computes each
output by fetching and adding its required products. To this end, each weight
is replaced offline by an index in the buffer of unique products. Indices are
typically smaller than the quantized weights, since the number of unique
weights for each input tends to be much lower than the range of quantized
weights, which reduces storage and memory bandwidth requirements.

Overall, CREW greatly reduces the number of multiplications and provides
significant savings in model memory footprint and memory bandwidth usage. We
evaluate CREW on a diverse set of modern DNNs. On average, CREW provides 2.61x
speedup and 2.42x energy savings over a TPU-like accelerator. Compared to UCNN,
a state-of-art computation reuse technique, CREW achieves 2.10x speedup and
2.08x energy savings on average.]]></summary>

functions. Introductions to deep learning theory commonly present the

avoiding social and economic loss in coastal cities. Compared to the
traditional empirical-based or numerical-based forecasting models, "soft
computing" approaches, including machine learning and deep learning models,
have shown numerous success in recent years. In this paper, we focus on
enabling the deep learning model to learn both short-term and long-term
spatial-temporal dependencies for SWH prediction. A Wavelet Graph Neural
Network (WGNN) approach is proposed to integrate the advantages of wavelet
transform and graph neural network. Several parallel graph neural networks are
separately trained on wavelet decomposed data, and the reconstruction of each
model's prediction forms the final SWH prediction. Experimental results show
that the proposed WGNN approach outperforms other models, including the
numerical models, the machine learning models, and several deep learning

deep learning as a special case, there has been considerable interest in
developing representation learning techniques that can incorporate known
physical constraints into the learned representation. As one example, in many
applications that involve a signal propagating through physical media (e.g.,
optics, acoustics, fluid dynamics, etc), it is known that the dynamics of the
signal must satisfy constraints imposed by the wave equation. Here we propose a
matrix factorization technique that decomposes such signals into a sum of
components, where each component is regularized to ensure that it satisfies
wave equation constraints. Although our proposed formulation is non-convex, we
prove that our model can be efficiently solved to global optimality in
polynomial time. We demonstrate the benefits of our work by applications in
structural health monitoring, where prior work has attempted to solve this
problem using sparse dictionary learning approaches that do not come with any
theoretical guarantees regarding convergence to global optimality and employ
heuristics to capture desired physical constraints.]]></summary>

challenges in deployment in application scenarios with limited memory and
computation capacity. Knowledge distillation is one approach to derive compact
models from bigger ones. However, it has been observed that a converged heavy
teacher model is strongly constrained for learning a compact student network
and could make the optimization subject to poor local optima. In this paper, we
propose ProKT, a new model-agnostic method by projecting the supervision
signals of a teacher model into the student's parameter space. Such projection
is implemented by decomposing the training objective into local intermediate
targets with an approximate mirror descent technique. The proposed method could
be less sensitive with the quirks during optimization which could result in a
better local optimum. Experiments on both image and text datasets show that our

to their interpretability, ease of use, and strong theoretical guarantees.
Cross-validation (CV) is widely used for hyperparameter tuning in these models,
but do practical optimization methods minimize the true out-of-sample loss? A
recent line of research promises to show that the optimum of the CV loss
matches the optimum of the out-of-sample loss (possibly after simple
corrections). It remains to show how tractable it is to minimize the CV loss.
In the present paper, we show that, in the case of ridge regression, the CV
loss may fail to be quasiconvex and thus may have multiple local optima. We can
guarantee that the CV loss is quasiconvex in at least one case: when the
spectrum of the covariate matrix is nearly flat and the noise in the observed
responses is not too high. More generally, we show that quasiconvexity status
is independent of many properties of the observed data (response norm,
covariate-matrix right singular vectors and singular-value scaling) and has a
complex dependence on the few that remain. We empirically confirm our theory
using simulated experiments.]]></summary>

method that has been widely studied in the past decade. In 1bCS, linear samples
of a high dimensional signal are quantized to only one bit per sample (sign of
the measurement). Assuming the original signal vector to be sparse, existing
results either aim to find the support of the vector, or approximate the signal
within an $\epsilon$-ball. The focus of this paper is support recovery, which
often also computationally facilitates approximate signal recovery. A universal
measurement matrix for 1bCS refers to one set of measurements that work for all
sparse signals. With universality, it is known that $\tilde{\Theta}(k^2)$ 1bCS
measurements are necessary and sufficient for support recovery (where $k$
denotes the sparsity). In this work, we show that it is possible to universally
recover the support with a small number of false positives with
$\tilde{O}(k^{3/2})$ measurements. If the dynamic range of the signal vector is
known, then with a different technique, this result can be improved to only
$\tilde{O}(k)$ measurements. Further results on support recovery are also

levels on many AI tasks. Several applications rely more and more on DNNs to
deliver sophisticated services and DNN accelerators are becoming integral

operations per inference and DNN accelerators integrate thousands of
multiply-accumulate units leading to increased energy requirements. Approximate
computing principles are employed to significantly lower the energy consumption
of DNN accelerators at the cost of some accuracy loss. Nevertheless, recent
research demonstrated that complex DNNs are increasingly sensitive to

targeting tight accuracy constraints. In this work, we present a dynamically

exact, positive error, and negative error. In addition, we propose a
filter-oriented approximation method to map the weights to the appropriate
modes of the approximate multiplier. Our mapping algorithm balances the
positive with the negative errors due to the approximate multiplications,
aiming at maximizing the energy reduction while minimizing the overall
convolution error. We evaluate our approach on multiple DNNs and datasets

reward. Neural-guided search provides a flexible means of searching these
combinatorial spaces using an autoregressive recurrent neural network. A major
benefit of this approach is that builds up objects sequentially--this provides
an opportunity to incorporate domain knowledge into the search by directly
modifying the logits emitted during sampling. In this work, we formalize a
framework for incorporating such in situ priors and constraints into
neural-guided search, and provide sufficient conditions for enforcing

speech processing. With recent state-of-the-art attention-based automatic
speech recognition (ASR) structure, NAR can realize promising real-time factor
(RTF) improvement with only small degradation of accuracy compared to the
autoregressive (AR) models. However, the recognition inference needs to wait
for the completion of a full speech utterance, which limits their applications
on low latency scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end
streaming NAR speech recognition system by combining blockwise-attention and
connectionist temporal classification with mask-predict (Mask-CTC) NAR. During
inference, the input audio is separated into small blocks and then processed in
a blockwise streaming way. To address the insertion and deletion error at the
edge of the output of each block, we apply an overlapping decoding strategy
with a dynamic mapping trick that can produce more coherent sentences.
Experimental results show that the proposed method improves online ASR
recognition in low latency conditions compared to vanilla Mask-CTC. Moreover,
it can achieve a much faster inference speed compared to the AR attention-based
models. All of our codes will be publicly available at

used to address two challenges that autonomous systems face when they endeavor
to learn from, adapt to, and collaborate with humans : (1) identifying the
human's intent and (2) safely optimizing the autonomous system's behavior to
achieve this inferred intent. First, we use the offline dataset to efficiently
infer the human's reward function via pool-based active preference learning.
Second, given this learned reward function, we perform offline reinforcement
learning to optimize a policy based on the inferred human intent. Crucially,
our proposed approach does not require actual physical rollouts or an accurate
simulator for either the reward learning or policy optimization steps, enabling
both safe and efficient apprenticeship learning. We identify and evaluate our
approach on a subset of existing offline RL benchmarks that are well suited for
offline reward learning and also evaluate extensions of these benchmarks which
allow more open-ended behaviors. Our experiments show that offline
preference-based reward learning followed by offline reinforcement learning
enables efficient and high-performing policies, while only requiring small

described by a vector of parameters $\theta$, and realized as a piecewise
linear continuous function $R_{\theta}: x \in \mathbb R^{d} \mapsto
R_{\theta}(x) \in \mathbb R^{k}$. Natural scalings and permutations operations
on the parameters $\theta$ leave the realization unchanged, leading to
equivalence classes of parameters that yield the same realization. These
considerations in turn lead to the notion of identifiability -- the ability to
recover (the equivalence class of) $\theta$ from the sole knowledge of its
realization $R_{\theta}$. The overall objective of this paper is to introduce
an embedding for ReLU neural networks of any depth, $\Phi(\theta)$, that is
invariant to scalings and that provides a locally linear parameterization of
the realization of the network. Leveraging these two key properties, we derive
some conditions under which a deep ReLU network is indeed locally identifiable
from the knowledge of the realization on a finite set of samples $x_{i} \in
\mathbb R^{d}$. We study the shallow case in more depth, establishing necessary

able to compose skills and concepts in novel ways, regardless of whether the

existing models have much to improve upon towards handling new compositions. We
present a novel method for learning to compose skills and concepts that
separates these two factors implicitly within a model by learning grounded
concept representations and disentangling the encoding of skills from that of

genetic programming for finding accurate and trustworthy prediction models for
this task. However, it is not straight-forward how nominal variables can be
included. In particular, a one-hot-encoding is unsatisfactory because genetic
programming tends to remove such indicator variables. We have therefore used
so-called factor variables for representing nominal variables in symbolic
regression models. Our results show that GP is able to produce symbolic

has low variance, and can be used with differentiable and non-differentiable

models. Exemplar VAE, as a variant of VAE with an exemplar-based prior, has
achieved impressive results. However, due to the nature of model design, an
exemplar-based model usually requires vast amounts of data to participate in
training, which leads to huge computational complexity. To address this issue,
we propose Bayesian Pseudocoresets Exemplar VAE (ByPE-VAE), a new variant of
VAE with a prior based on Bayesian pseudocoreset. The proposed prior is
conditioned on a small-scale pseudocoreset rather than the whole dataset for
reducing the computational cost and avoiding overfitting. Simultaneously, we
obtain the optimal pseudocoreset via a stochastic optimization algorithm during
VAE training aiming to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the
prior based on the pseudocoreset and that based on the whole dataset.
Experimental results show that ByPE-VAE can achieve competitive improvements
over the state-of-the-art VAEs in the tasks of density estimation,
representation learning, and generative data augmentation. Particularly, on a
basic VAE architecture, ByPE-VAE is up to 3 times faster than Exemplar VAE
while almost holding the performance. Code is available at our supplementary

still very useful, e.g, Search Engines (Google Chrome). Speeding them up, in
small additional space with respect to the table being searched into, is still
a quite significant achievement. Static Learned Indexes have been very
successful in achieving such a speed-up, but leave open a major question: To
what extent one can enjoy the speed-up of Learned Indexes while using constant
or nearly constant additional space. By generalizing the experimental
methodology of a recent benchmarking study on Learned Indexes, we shed light on
this question, by considering two scenarios. The first, quite elementary, i.e.,
textbook code, and the second using advanced Learned Indexing algorithms and
the supporting sophisticated software platforms. Although in both cases one
would expect a positive answer, its achievement is not as simple as it seems.
Indeed, our extensive set of experiments reveal a complex relationship between

corresponding quantitative estimates, across memory levels, can be of interest
to algorithm designers and of use to practitioners as well. As an essential
part of our research, we introduce two new models that are of interest in their
own right. The first is a constant space model that can be seen as a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph neural networks (GNNs) are naturally distributed architectures for
learning representations from network data. This renders them suitable
candidates for decentralized tasks. In these scenarios, the underlying graph
often changes with time due to link failures or topology variations, creating a
mismatch between the graphs on which GNNs were trained and the ones on which
they are tested. Online learning can be leveraged to retrain GNNs at testing
time to overcome this issue. However, most online algorithms are centralized
and usually offer guarantees only on convex problems, which GNNs rarely lead
to. This paper develops the Wide and Deep GNN (WD-GNN), a novel architecture
that can be updated with distributed online learning mechanisms. The WD-GNN
consists of two components: the wide part is a linear graph filter and the deep
part is a nonlinear GNN. At training time, the joint wide and deep architecture
learns nonlinear representations from data. At testing time, the wide, linear
part is retrained, while the deep, nonlinear one remains fixed. This often
leads to a convex formulation. We further propose a distributed online learning
algorithm that can be implemented in a decentralized setting. We also show the
stability of the WD-GNN to changes of the underlying graph and analyze the
convergence of the proposed online learning procedure. Experiments on movie
recommendation, source localization and robot swarm control corroborate
theoretical findings and show the potential of the WD-GNN for distributed
online learning.]]></summary>

small variations can distort the dynamics described by trajectory data. This
work builds on operator inference from scientific machine learning to infer
low-dimensional models from high-dimensional state trajectories polluted with
noise. The presented analysis shows that, under certain conditions, the
inferred operators are unbiased estimators of the well-studied projection-based
reduced operators from traditional model reduction. Furthermore, the connection
between operator inference and projection-based model reduction enables
bounding the mean-squared errors of predictions made with the learned models
with respect to traditional reduced models. The analysis also motivates an
active operator inference approach that judiciously samples high-dimensional
trajectories with the aim of achieving a low mean-squared error by reducing the
effect of noise. Numerical experiments with high-dimensional linear and
nonlinear state dynamics demonstrate that predictions obtained with active
operator inference have orders of magnitude lower mean-squared errors than
operator inference with traditional, equidistantly sampled trajectory data.]]></summary>

with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We find empirically that long after
performance has converged, networks continue to move through parameter space by
a process of anomalous diffusion in which distance travelled grows as a power
law in the number of gradient updates with a nontrivial exponent. We reveal an
intricate interaction between the hyperparameters of optimization, the
structure in the gradient noise, and the Hessian matrix at the end of training
that explains this anomalous diffusion. To build this understanding, we first
derive a continuous-time model for SGD with finite learning rates and batch
sizes as an underdamped Langevin equation. We study this equation in the
setting of linear regression, where we can derive exact, analytic expressions
for the phase space dynamics of the parameters and their instantaneous
velocities from initialization to stationarity. Using the Fokker-Planck
equation, we show that the key ingredient driving these dynamics is not the
original training loss, but rather the combination of a modified loss, which
implicitly regularizes the velocity, and probability currents, which cause
oscillations in phase space. We identify qualitative and quantitative
predictions of this theory in the dynamics of a ResNet-18 model trained on
ImageNet. Through the lens of statistical physics, we uncover a mechanistic
origin for the anomalous limiting dynamics of deep neural networks trained with
SGD.]]></summary>

failure of some of the agents observed from the command base. It is generally
difficult to distinguish whether the failure is caused by actuators
(hypothesis, $h_a$) or sensors (hypothesis, $h_s$) solely by the communication
between the command base and the concerning agent. By making a collision to the
agent by another, we would be able to distinguish which hypothesis is likely:
For $h_a$, we expect to detect corresponding displacements while for $h_a$ we
do not. Such swarm strategies to grasp the situation are preferably to be
generated autonomously by artificial intelligence (AI). Preferable actions
($e.g.$, the collision) for the distinction would be those maximizing the
difference between the expected behaviors for each hypothesis, as a value
function. Such actions exist, however, only very sparsely in the whole
possibilities, for which the conventional search based on gradient methods does
not make sense. Instead, we have successfully applied the reinforcement
learning technique, achieving the maximization of such a sparse value function.
The machine learning actually concluded autonomously the colliding action to
distinguish the hypothesises. Getting recognized an agent with actuator error
by the action, the agents behave as if other ones want to assist the
malfunctioning one to achieve a given mission.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper presents a constrained policy gradient algorithm. We introduce
constraints for safe learning with the following steps. First, learning is
slowed down (lazy learning) so that the episodic policy change can be computed
with the help of the policy gradient theorem and the neural tangent kernel.
Then, this enables us the evaluation of the policy at arbitrary states too. In
the same spirit, learning can be guided, ensuring safety via augmenting episode
batches with states where the desired action probabilities are prescribed.
Finally, exogenous discounted sum of future rewards (returns) can be computed
at these specific state-action pairs such that the policy network satisfies
constraints. Computing the returns is based on solving a system of linear
equations (equality constraints) or a constrained quadratic program (inequality
constraints). Simulation results suggest that adding constraints (external
information) to the learning can improve learning in terms of speed and safety
reasonably if constraints are appropriately selected. The efficiency of the
constrained learning was demonstrated with a shallow and wide ReLU network in
the Cartpole and Lunar Lander OpenAI gym environments. The main novelty of the
paper is giving a practical use of the neural tangent kernel in reinforcement
learning.]]></summary>

promising successes in approximate inference for complex distributions.
However, their empirical performance depends crucially on the choice of optimal

previous approaches which has been proved sub-optimal. Inspired by the paradigm
of multiple kernel learning, our solution to this issue is using a combination
of multiple kernels to approximate the optimal kernel instead of a single one
which may limit the performance and flexibility. To do so, we extend Kernelized
Stein Discrepancy (KSD) to its multiple kernel view called Multiple Kernelized
Stein Discrepancy (MKSD). Further, we leverage MKSD to construct a general
algorithm based on SVGD, which be called Multiple Kernel SVGD (MK-SVGD).
Besides, we automatically assign a weight to each kernel without any other
parameters. The proposed method not only gets rid of optimal kernel dependence
but also maintains computational effectiveness. Experiments on various tasks
and models show the effectiveness of our method.]]></summary>

Resonance (MR) image acquisition can cause image artifacts. Motion correction
techniques have been proposed to compensate for these types of motion during
thoracic scans, relying on accurate motion estimation from undersampled
motion-resolved reconstruction. A particular interest and challenge lie in the
derivation of reliable non-rigid motion fields from the undersampled
motion-resolved data. Motion estimation is usually formulated in image space
via diffusion, parametric-spline, or optical flow methods. However, image-based
registration can be impaired by remaining aliasing artifacts due to the
undersampled motion-resolved reconstruction. In this work, we describe a
formalism to perform non-rigid registration directly in the sampled Fourier
space, i.e. k-space. We propose a deep-learning based approach to perform fast
and accurate non-rigid registration from the undersampled k-space data. The
basic working principle originates from the Local All-Pass (LAP) technique, a
recently introduced optical flow-based registration. The proposed LAPNet is
compared against traditional and deep learning image-based registrations and
tested on fully-sampled and highly-accelerated (with two undersampling
strategies) 3D respiratory motion-resolved MR images in a cohort of 40 patients

surveillance applications that capture visual data from a bird's-eye
perspective. This leaves aside precious relationships and visual cues that
could be captured through a first-person view of a scene. In this work, we
propose a strategy to exploit the power of current game engines, such as Unity,
to transform pre-existing bird's-eye view datasets into a first-person view, in
particular, a depth view. Using this strategy, we are able to generate large
volumes of synthetic data that can be used to pre-train a social navigation
model. To test our ideas, we present DeepSocNav, a deep learning based model
that takes advantage of the proposed approach to generate synthetic data.
Furthermore, DeepSocNav includes a self-supervised strategy that is included as
an auxiliary task. This consists of predicting the next depth frame that the
agent will face. Our experiments show the benefits of the proposed model that

popular. However, it is still challenging to propose a robust makeup transfer
method in the real-world environment. Current makeup transfer methods mostly
work well on good-conditioned clean makeup images, but transferring makeup that
exhibits shadow and occlusion is not satisfying. To alleviate it, we propose a
novel makeup transfer method, called 3D-Aware Shadow and Occlusion Robust GAN
(SOGAN). Given the source and the reference faces, we first fit a 3D face model
and then disentangle the faces into shape and texture. In the texture branch,
we map the texture to the UV space and design a UV texture generator to
transfer the makeup. Since human faces are symmetrical in the UV space, we can
conveniently remove the undesired shadow and occlusion from the reference image
by carefully designing a Flip Attention Module (FAM). After obtaining cleaner
makeup features from the reference image, a Makeup Transfer Module (MTM) is
introduced to perform accurate makeup transfer. The qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate that our SOGAN not only achieves superior
results in shadow and occlusion situations but also performs well in large pose
and expression variations.]]></summary>

imaging due to their promising pattern recognition capabilities. However, Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs) require a huge amount of data, and because of the lack
of sufficient data in this field, transfer learning can be a great solution.
DNNs used for disease diagnosis meticulously concentrate on improving the
accuracy of predictions without providing a figure about their confidence of
predictions. Knowing how much a DNN model is confident in a computer-aided
diagnosis model is necessary for gaining clinicians' confidence and trust in
DL-based solutions. To address this issue, this work presents three different
methods for quantifying uncertainties for skin cancer detection from images. It
also comprehensively evaluates and compares performance of these DNNs using
novel uncertainty-related metrics. The obtained results reveal that the
predictive uncertainty estimation methods are capable of flagging risky and
erroneous predictions with a high uncertainty estimate. We also demonstrate
that ensemble approaches are more reliable in capturing uncertainties through

a novel topic, weakly-supervised semantic segmentation in cityscape via HSIs.
It is based on the idea that high-resolution HSIs in city scenes contain rich
spectral information, which can be easily associated to semantics without
manual labeling. Therefore, it enables low cost, highly reliable semantic
segmentation in complex scenes. Specifically, in this paper, we theoretically
analyze the HSIs and introduce a weakly-supervised HSI semantic segmentation
framework, which utilizes spectral information to improve the coarse labels to
a finer degree. The experimental results show that our method can obtain highly
competitive labels and even have higher edge fineness than artificial fine
labels in some classes. At the same time, the results also show that the
refined labels can effectively improve the effect of semantic segmentation. The

human-computer interaction. Early methods focus on extracting appearance and
geometry features associated with human affects, while ignoring the latent
semantic information among individual facial changes, leading to limited
performance and generalization. Recent work attempts to establish a graph-based
representation to model these semantic relationships and develop frameworks to
leverage them for various FAA tasks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive
review of graph-based FAA, including the evolution of algorithms and their
applications. First, the FAA background knowledge is introduced, especially on
the role of the graph. We then discuss approaches that are widely used for
graph-based affective representation in literature and show a trend towards
graph construction. For the relational reasoning in graph-based FAA, existing
studies are categorized according to their usage of traditional methods or deep
models, with a special emphasis on the latest graph neural networks.
Performance comparisons of the state-of-the-art graph-based FAA methods are
also summarized. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential directions.
As far as we know, this is the first survey of graph-based FAA methods. Our
findings can serve as a reference for future research in this field.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The two leading hypotheses for the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) in the
$\textit{Fermi}$ data are an unresolved population of faint millisecond pulsars
(MSPs) and dark-matter (DM) annihilation. The dichotomy between these
explanations is typically reflected by modeling them as two separate emission
components. However, point-sources (PSs) such as MSPs become statistically
degenerate with smooth Poisson emission in the ultra-faint limit (formally
where each source is expected to contribute much less than one photon on
average), leading to an ambiguity that can render questions such as whether the
emission is PS-like or Poissonian in nature ill-defined. We present a
conceptually new approach that describes the PS and Poisson emission in a
unified manner and only afterwards derives constraints on the Poissonian
component from the so obtained results. For the implementation of this
approach, we leverage deep learning techniques, centered around a neural
network-based method for histogram regression that expresses uncertainties in
terms of quantiles. We demonstrate that our method is robust against a number
of systematics that have plagued previous approaches, in particular DM / PS
misattribution. In the $\textit{Fermi}$ data, we find a faint GCE described by
a median source-count distribution (SCD) peaked at a flux of $\sim4 \times
10^{-11} \ \text{counts} \ \text{cm}^{-2} \ \text{s}^{-1}$ (corresponding to
$\sim3 - 4$ expected counts per PS), which would require $N \sim
\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ sources to explain the entire excess (median value $N =
\text{29,300}$ across the sky). Although faint, this SCD allows us to derive
the constraint $\eta_P \leq 66\%$ for the Poissonian fraction of the GCE flux
$\eta_P$ at 95% confidence, suggesting that a substantial amount of the GCE
flux is due to PSs.]]></summary>

consecutive timesteps. We showcase Multi-StyleGAN on imagery of multiple live
yeast cells in microstructured environments and train on a dataset recorded in
our laboratory. The simulation captures underlying biophysical factors and time
dependencies, such as cell morphology, growth, physical interactions, as well
as the intensity of a fluorescent reporter protein. An immediate application is
to generate additional training and validation data for feature extraction
algorithms or to aid and expedite development of advanced experimental
techniques such as online monitoring or control of cells.

Availability of sufficient pixel-level annotations for the training data is a
hurdle. Active learning helps learning from small amounts of data by suggesting
the most promising samples for labeling. In this work, we propose a new
pool-based method for active learning, which proposes promising patches
extracted from full image, in each acquisition step. The problem is framed in
an exploration-exploitation framework by combining an embedding based on
Uniform Manifold Approximation to model representativeness with entropy as
uncertainty measure to model informativeness. We applied our proposed method to
the autonomous driving datasets CamVid and Cityscapes and performed a
quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art baselines. We find that our

solutions for interactive tasks in large-scale realistic scenes. Our
environment contains 15 fully interactive home-sized scenes with 108 rooms
populated with rigid and articulated objects. The scenes are replicas of
real-world homes, with distribution and the layout of objects aligned to those
of the real world. iGibson 1.0 integrates several key features to facilitate
the study of interactive tasks: i) generation of high-quality virtual sensor
signals (RGB, depth, segmentation, LiDAR, flow and so on), ii) domain
randomization to change the materials of the objects (both visual and physical)
and/or their shapes, iii) integrated sampling-based motion planners to generate
collision-free trajectories for robot bases and arms, and iv) intuitive
human-iGibson interface that enables efficient collection of human
demonstrations. Through experiments, we show that the full interactivity of the
scenes enables agents to learn useful visual representations that accelerate
the training of downstream manipulation tasks. We also show that iGibson 1.0
features enable the generalization of navigation agents, and that the
human-iGibson interface and integrated motion planners facilitate efficient
imitation learning of human demonstrated (mobile) manipulation behaviors.
iGibson 1.0 is open-source, equipped with comprehensive examples and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning techniques for 3D brain vessel image segmentation have not been
as successful as in the segmentation of other organs and tissues. This can be
explained by two factors. First, deep learning techniques tend to show poor
performances at the segmentation of relatively small objects compared to the
size of the full image. Second, due to the complexity of vascular trees and the
small size of vessels, it is challenging to obtain the amount of annotated
training data typically needed by deep learning methods. To address these
problems, we propose a novel annotation-efficient deep learning vessel
segmentation framework. The framework avoids pixel-wise annotations, only
requiring weak patch-level labels to discriminate between vessel and non-vessel
2D patches in the training set, in a setup similar to the CAPTCHAs used to
differentiate humans from bots in web applications. The user-provided weak
annotations are used for two tasks: 1) to synthesize pixel-wise pseudo-labels
for vessels and background in each patch, which are used to train a
segmentation network, and 2) to train a classifier network. The classifier
network allows to generate additional weak patch labels, further reducing the
annotation burden, and it acts as a noise filter for poor quality images. We
use this framework for the segmentation of the cerebrovascular tree in
Time-of-Flight angiography (TOF) and Susceptibility-Weighted Images (SWI). The
results show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while
reducing the annotation time by ~77% w.r.t. learning-based segmentation methods
using pixel-wise labels for training.]]></summary>

protoplanetary disk, are often interpreted as signatures of embedded planets.
Fitting a model of planetary gaps to these observed features using customized
simulations or empirical relations can reveal the characteristics of the hidden
planets. However, customized fitting is often impractical owing to the
increasing sample size and the complexity of disk-planet interaction. In this
paper we introduce the architecture of DPNNet-2.0, second in the series after
DPNNet \citep{aud20}, designed using a Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN, here
specifically ResNet50) for predicting exoplanet masses directly from simulated
images of protoplanetary disks hosting a single planet. DPNNet-2.0 additionally
consists of a multi-input framework that uses both a CNN and multi-layer
perceptron (a class of artificial neural network) for processing image and disk
parameters simultaneously. This enables DPNNet-2.0 to be trained using images
directly, with the added option of considering disk parameters (disk
viscosities, disk temperatures, disk surface density profiles, dust abundances,
and particle Stokes numbers) generated from disk-planet hydrodynamic
simulations as inputs. This work provides the required framework and is the
first step towards the use of computer vision (implementing CNN) to directly
extract mass of an exoplanet from planetary gaps observed in dust-surface
density maps by telescopes such as the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimeter Array.]]></summary>

exploration, using jointly their senses of vision and touch. However, in 3D
shape reconstruction, most recent progress has relied on static datasets of
limited sensory data such as RGB images, depth maps or haptic readings, leaving
the active exploration of the shape largely unexplored. In active touch sensing
for 3D reconstruction, the goal is to actively select the tactile readings that
maximize the improvement in shape reconstruction accuracy. However, the
development of deep learning-based active touch models is largely limited by
the lack of frameworks for shape exploration. In this paper, we focus on this
problem and introduce a system composed of: 1) a haptic simulator leveraging
high spatial resolution vision-based tactile sensors for active touching of 3D
objects; 2) a mesh-based 3D shape reconstruction model that relies on tactile
or visuotactile signals; and 3) a set of data-driven solutions with either
tactile or visuotactile priors to guide the shape exploration. Our framework
enables the development of the first fully data-driven solutions to active
touch on top of learned models for object understanding. Our experiments show
the benefits of such solutions in the task of 3D shape understanding where our
models consistently outperform natural baselines. We provide our framework as a
tool to foster future research in this direction.]]></summary>

effective for strengthening the context modeling ability in convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). However, its pixel-wise computational overhead is
prohibitive which renders it unsuitable for high resolution imagery. In this
paper, we explore the efficiency of context graph reasoning and propose a novel
framework called Squeeze Reasoning. Instead of propagating information on the
spatial map, we first learn to squeeze the input feature into a channel-wise
global vector and perform reasoning within the single vector where the
computation cost can be significantly reduced. Specifically, we build the node
graph in the vector where each node represents an abstract semantic concept.
The refined feature within the same semantic category results to be consistent,
which is thus beneficial for downstream tasks. We show that our approach can be
modularized as an end-to-end trained block and can be easily plugged into

growth in the inflation rate has compelled people to invest in the stock and
commodity markets and other areas rather than saving. Further, the ability of
Deep Learning models to make predictions on the time series data has been
proven time and again. Technical analysis on the stock market with the help of
technical indicators has been the most common practice among traders and
investors. One more aspect is the sentiment analysis - the emotion of the
investors that shows the willingness to invest. A variety of techniques have
been used by people around the globe involving basic Machine Learning and
Neural Networks. Ranging from the basic linear regression to the advanced
neural networks people have experimented with all possible techniques to
predict the stock market. It's evident from recent events how news and
headlines affect the stock markets and cryptocurrencies. This paper proposes an
ensemble of state-of-the-art methods for predicting stock prices. Firstly
sentiment analysis of the news and the headlines for the company Apple Inc,
listed on the NASDAQ is performed using a version of BERT, which is a
pre-trained transformer model by Google for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Afterward, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) predicts the stock price for
Apple Inc using the technical indicators, stock indexes of various countries,
some commodities, and historical prices along with the sentiment scores.
Comparison is done with baseline models like - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM),
Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), vanilla GAN, and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) model.]]></summary>

questions given input images. They are a testbed for learning high-level
reasoning with a primary use in HCI, for instance assistance for the visually
impaired. Recent research has shown that state-of-the-art models tend to
produce answers exploiting biases and shortcuts in the training data, and
sometimes do not even look at the input image, instead of performing the
required reasoning steps. We present VisQA, a visual analytics tool that
explores this question of reasoning vs. bias exploitation. It exposes the key
element of state-of-the-art neural models -- attention maps in transformers.
Our working hypothesis is that reasoning steps leading to model predictions are
observable from attention distributions, which are particularly useful for
visualization. The design process of VisQA was motivated by well-known bias
examples from the fields of deep learning and vision-language reasoning and
evaluated in two ways. First, as a result of a collaboration of three fields,
machine learning, vision and language reasoning, and data analytics, the work
lead to a better understanding of bias exploitation of neural models for VQA,
which eventually resulted in an impact on its design and training through the
proposition of a method for the transfer of reasoning patterns from an oracle
model. Second, we also report on the design of VisQA, and a goal-oriented
evaluation of VisQA targeting the analysis of a model decision process from
multiple experts, providing evidence that it makes the inner workings of models
accessible to users.]]></summary>

challenging as various methods are continually being developed to generate
adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose an evolutionary approach to
automatically determine Image Processing Techniques Sequence (IPTS) for
detecting malicious inputs. Accordingly, we first used a diverse set of attack
methods including adaptive attack methods (on our defense) to generate
adversarial samples from the clean dataset. A detection framework based on a
genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to find the optimal IPTS, where the
optimality is estimated by different fitness measures such as Euclidean
distance, entropy loss, average histogram, local binary pattern and loss
functions. The "image difference" between the original and processed images is
used to extract the features, which are then fed to a classification scheme in
order to determine whether the input sample is adversarial or clean. This paper
described our methodology and performed experiments using multiple data-sets
tested with several adversarial attacks. For each attack-type and dataset, it
generates unique IPTS. A set of IPTS selected dynamically in testing time which
works as a filter for the adversarial attack. Our empirical experiments
exhibited promising results indicating the approach can efficiently be used as

challenges in deployment in application scenarios with limited memory and
computation capacity. Knowledge distillation is one approach to derive compact
models from bigger ones. However, it has been observed that a converged heavy
teacher model is strongly constrained for learning a compact student network
and could make the optimization subject to poor local optima. In this paper, we
propose ProKT, a new model-agnostic method by projecting the supervision
signals of a teacher model into the student's parameter space. Such projection
is implemented by decomposing the training objective into local intermediate
targets with an approximate mirror descent technique. The proposed method could
be less sensitive with the quirks during optimization which could result in a
better local optimum. Experiments on both image and text datasets show that our
proposed ProKT consistently achieves superior performance compared to other

decomposition, or robust principal component analysis (PCA), has achieved
stunning performance. However, the selection of the parameters of L+S is
empirical, and the acceleration rate is limited, which are common failings of
iterative compressed sensing MR imaging (CS-MRI) reconstruction methods. Many
deep learning approaches have been proposed to address these issues, but few of
them use a low-rank prior. In this paper, a model-based low-rank plus sparse
network, dubbed L+S-Net, is proposed for dynamic MR reconstruction. In
particular, we use an alternating linearized minimization method to solve the
optimization problem with low-rank and sparse regularization. Learned soft
singular value thresholding is introduced to ensure the clear separation of the
L component and S component. Then, the iterative steps are unrolled into a
network in which the regularization parameters are learnable. We prove that the
proposed L+S-Net achieves global convergence under two standard assumptions.
Experiments on retrospective and prospective cardiac cine datasets show that
the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art CS and existing deep learning
methods and has great potential for extremely high acceleration factors (up to
24x).]]></summary>

zero-shot transfer to a priori unknown test distributions. However, common
evaluation protocols only test a single, fixed data split in which train and
test classes are assigned randomly. More realistic evaluations should consider
a broad spectrum of distribution shifts with potentially varying degree and
difficulty. In this work, we systematically construct train-test splits of
increasing difficulty and present the ooDML benchmark to characterize
generalization under out-of-distribution shifts in DML. ooDML is designed to
probe the generalization performance on much more challenging, diverse
train-to-test distribution shifts. Based on our new benchmark, we conduct a
thorough empirical analysis of state-of-the-art DML methods. We find that while
generalization tends to consistently degrade with difficulty, some methods are
better at retaining performance as the distribution shift increases. Finally,
we propose few-shot DML as an efficient way to consistently improve
generalization in response to unknown test shifts presented in ooDML. Code

to cooperatively navigate across photo-realistic environments to reach target

Moreover, a memory-augmented communication framework is proposed. Each agent is
equipped with a private, external memory to persistently store communication

anchor-based detectors. While pruning techniques are widely used to reduce the
computational cost of convolutional neural networks, they tend to focus on

work we demonstrate an additional pruning technique, specifically for object
detection: anchor pruning. With more efficient backbone networks and a growing
trend of deploying object detectors on embedded systems where post-processing
steps such as non-maximum suppression can be a bottleneck, the impact of the
anchors used in the detection head is becoming increasingly more important. In
this work, we show that many anchors in the object detection head can be
removed without any loss in accuracy. With additional retraining, anchor
pruning can even lead to improved accuracy. Extensive experiments on SSD and MS
COCO show that the detection head can be made up to 44% more efficient while
simultaneously increasing accuracy. Further experiments on RetinaNet and PASCAL

`overanchorized' models that can be used together with anchor pruning to
eliminate hyperparameters related to the initial shape of anchors.]]></summary>

various applied fields. In computer graphics, special attention has been given
to the registration between two partial point clouds generated by scanning
devices. State-of-the-art registration techniques still struggle when the
overlap region between the two point clouds is small, and completely fail if
there is no overlap between the scan pairs. In this paper, we present a
learning-based technique that alleviates this problem, and allows registration
between point clouds, presented in arbitrary poses, and having little or even
no overlap, a setting that has been referred to as tele-registration. Our
technique is based on a novel neural network design that learns a prior of a
class of shapes and can complete a partial shape. The key idea is combining the
registration and completion tasks in a way that reinforces each other. In
particular, we simultaneously train the registration network and completion
network using two coupled flows, one that register-and-complete, and one that
complete-and-register, and encourage the two flows to produce a consistent
result. We show that, compared with each separate flow, this two-flow training
leads to robust and reliable tele-registration, and hence to a better point
cloud prediction that completes the registered scans. It is also worth
mentioning that each of the components in our neural network outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both completion and registration. We further
analyze our network with several ablation studies and demonstrate its
performance on a large number of partial point clouds, both synthetic and
real-world, that have only small or no overlap.]]></summary>

a wide range of human and machine perception tasks. For human perception tasks,
a distortion quantification can substitute subjective experiments to guide 3D
visualization; while for machine perception tasks, a distortion quantification
can work as a loss function to guide the training of deep neural networks for
unsupervised learning tasks. To handle a variety of demands in many
applications, a distortion quantification needs to be distortion discriminable,
differentiable, and have a low computational complexity. Currently, however,
there is a lack of a general distortion quantification that can satisfy all
three conditions. To fill this gap, this work proposes multiscale potential
energy discrepancy (MPED), a distortion quantification to measure point cloud
geometry and color difference. By evaluating at various neighborhood sizes, the
proposed MPED achieves global-local tradeoffs, capturing distortion in a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation aims to adapt
a segmentation model trained on the labeled source domain to the unlabeled
target domain. Existing methods try to learn domain invariant features while
suffering from large domain gaps that make it difficult to correctly align
discrepant features, especially in the initial training phase. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Dual Soft-Paste (DSP) method in this paper.
Specifically, DSP selects some classes from a source domain image using a
long-tail class first sampling strategy and softly pastes the corresponding
image patch on both the source and target training images with a fusion weight.
Technically, we adopt the mean teacher framework for domain adaptation, where
the pasted source and target images go through the student network while the
original target image goes through the teacher network. Output-level alignment
is carried out by aligning the probability maps of the target fused image from
both networks using a weighted cross-entropy loss. In addition, feature-level
alignment is carried out by aligning the feature maps of the source and target
images from student network using a weighted maximum mean discrepancy loss. DSP
facilitates the model learning domain-invariant features from the intermediate
domains, leading to faster convergence and better performance. Experiments on
two challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DSP over
state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

a single image with enhanced information. In recent years, state-of-the-art
methods have adopted Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to encode meaningful
features for image fusion. Specifically, CNN-based methods perform image fusion
by fusing local features. However, they do not consider long-range dependencies
that are present in the image. Transformer-based models are designed to
overcome this by modeling the long-range dependencies with the help of
self-attention mechanism. This motivates us to propose a novel Image Fusion
Transformer (IFT) where we develop a transformer-based multi-scale fusion
strategy that attends to both local and long-range information (or global
context). The proposed method follows a two-stage training approach. In the
first stage, we train an auto-encoder to extract deep features at multiple
scales. In the second stage, multi-scale features are fused using a
Spatio-Transformer (ST) fusion strategy. The ST fusion blocks are comprised of
a CNN and a transformer branch which capture local and long-range features,
respectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that
the proposed method performs better than many competitive fusion algorithms.
Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of the proposed ST fusion strategy with
an ablation analysis. The source code is available at:

lives and has affected all aspects of human life. This paper focuses on the
application of deep learning (DL) models to medical imaging and drug discovery
for managing COVID-19 disease. In this article, we detail various medical
imaging-based studies such as X-rays and computed tomography (CT) images along
with DL methods for classifying COVID-19 affected versus pneumonia. The
applications of DL techniques to medical images are further described in terms
of image localization, segmentation, registration, and classification leading
to COVID-19 detection. The reviews of recent papers indicate that the highest
classification accuracy of 99.80% is obtained when InstaCovNet-19 DL method is
applied to an X-ray dataset of 361 COVID-19 patients, 362 pneumonia patients
and 365 normal people. Furthermore, it can be seen that the best classification
accuracy of 99.054% can be achieved when EDL_COVID DL method is applied to a CT
image dataset of 7500 samples where COVID-19 patients, lung tumor patients and
normal people are equal in number. Moreover, we illustrate the potential DL

by utilizing transferable information learned from the available source domain
and a few labeled target data. However, source data is not always accessible in
practical scenarios, which restricts the application of SSDA in real world
circumstances. In this paper, we propose a novel task named Semi-supervised
Source Hypothesis Transfer (SSHT), which performs domain adaptation based on
source trained model, to generalize well in target domain with a few
supervisions. In SSHT, we are facing two challenges: (1) The insufficient
labeled target data may result in target features near the decision boundary,
with the increased risk of mis-classification; (2) The data are usually
imbalanced in source domain, so the model trained with these data is biased.
The biased model is prone to categorize samples of minority categories into
majority ones, resulting in low prediction diversity. To tackle the above
issues, we propose Consistency and Diversity Learning (CDL), a simple but
effective framework for SSHT by facilitating prediction consistency between two
randomly augmented unlabeled data and maintaining the prediction diversity when
adapting model to target domain. Encouraging consistency regularization brings
difficulty to memorize the few labeled target data and thus enhances the
generalization ability of the learned model. We further integrate Batch
Nuclear-norm Maximization into our method to enhance the discriminability and
diversity. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing SSDA
methods and unsupervised model adaptation methods on DomainNet, Office-Home and
Office-31 datasets. The code is available at

publicly available and fully-annotated datasets usually do not well-represent
the heterogeneous modalities, phases, pathologies, and clinical scenarios
encountered in real environments. On the other hand, there are tremendous
amounts of unlabelled patient imaging scans stored by many modern clinical
centers. In this work, we present a novel segmentation strategy,
co-heterogenous and adaptive segmentation (CHASe), which only requires a small
labeled cohort of single phase imaging data to adapt to any unlabeled cohort of
heterogenous multi-phase data with possibly new clinical scenarios and
pathologies. To do this, we propose a versatile framework that fuses appearance
based semi-supervision, mask based adversarial domain adaptation, and
pseudo-labeling. We also introduce co-heterogeneous training, which is a novel
integration of co-training and hetero modality learning. We have evaluated
CHASe using a clinically comprehensive and challenging dataset of multi-phase
computed tomography (CT) imaging studies (1147 patients and 4577 3D volumes).
Compared to previous state-of-the-art baselines, CHASe can further improve
pathological liver mask Dice-Sorensen coefficients by ranges of $4.2\% \sim
9.4\%$, depending on the phase combinations: e.g., from $84.6\%$ to $94.0\%$ on

has achieved great success in learning visual representations without data
annotations. However, most of methods mainly focus on the instance level
information (\ie, the different augmented images of the same instance should
have the same feature or cluster into the same class), but there is a lack of
attention on the relationships between different instances. In this paper, we
introduced a novel SSL paradigm, which we term as relational self-supervised
learning (ReSSL) framework that learns representations by modeling the
relationship between different instances. Specifically, our proposed method
employs sharpened distribution of pairwise similarities among different
instances as \textit{relation} metric, which is thus utilized to match the
feature embeddings of different augmentations. Moreover, to boost the
performance, we argue that weak augmentations matter to represent a more
reliable relation, and leverage momentum strategy for practical efficiency.
Experimental results show that our proposed ReSSL significantly outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both performance and training
efficiency. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/KyleZheng1997/ReSSL}.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few-shot learning aims at rapidly adapting to novel categories with only a
handful of samples at test time, which has been predominantly tackled with the
idea of meta-learning. However, meta-learning approaches essentially learn
across a variety of few-shot tasks and thus still require large-scale training
data with fine-grained supervision to derive a generalized model, thereby
involving prohibitive annotation cost. In this paper, we advance the few-shot
classification paradigm towards a more challenging scenario, i.e.,
cross-granularity few-shot classification, where the model observes only coarse
labels during training while is expected to perform fine-grained classification
during testing. This task largely relieves the annotation cost since
fine-grained labeling usually requires strong domain-specific expertise. To
bridge the cross-granularity gap, we approximate the fine-grained data
distribution by greedy clustering of each coarse-class into pseudo-fine-classes
according to the similarity of image embeddings. We then propose a
meta-embedder that jointly optimizes the visual- and semantic-discrimination,
in both instance-wise and coarse class-wise, to obtain a good feature space for
this coarse-to-fine pseudo-labeling process. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our
approach on three representative datasets.]]></summary>

understand tables. Its main task is to recognize the internal structure of a
table. However, due to the complexity and diversity in their structure and
style, it is very difficult to parse the tabular data into the structured
format which machines can understand easily, especially for complex tables. In
this paper, we introduce Split, Embed and Merge (SEM), an accurate table
structure recognizer. Our model takes table images as input and can correctly
recognize the structure of tables, whether they are simple or a complex tables.
SEM is mainly composed of three parts, splitter, embedder and merger. In the
first stage, we apply the splitter to predict the potential regions of the
table row (column) separators, and obtain the fine grid structure of the table.
In the second stage, by taking a full consideration of the textual information
in the table, we fuse the output features for each table grid from both vision
and language modalities. Moreover, we achieve a higher precision in our
experiments through adding additional semantic features. Finally, we process
the merging of these basic table grids in a self-regression manner. The
correspondent merging results is learned through the attention mechanism. In
our experiments, SEM achieves an average F1-Measure of 97.11% on the SciTSR
dataset which outperforms other methods by a large margin. We also won the
first place in the complex table and third place in all tables in ICDAR 2021
Competition on Scientific Literature Parsing, Task-B. Extensive experiments on
other publicly available datasets demonstrate that our model achieves

led to an outburst in the amount of data stored digitally. Consequently,
several retrieval systems have been developed depending on the type of data
stored in these databases. However, unlike text data or images, performing a
search for 3D models is non-trivial. Among 3D models, retrieving 3D
Engineering/CAD models or mechanical components is even more challenging due to
the presence of holes, volumetric features, presence of sharp edges etc., which
make CAD a domain unto itself. The research work presented in this paper aims
at developing a dataset suitable for building a retrieval system for 3D CAD
models based on deep learning. 3D CAD models from the available CAD databases
are collected, and a dataset of computer-generated sketch data, termed
'CADSketchNet', has been prepared. Additionally, hand-drawn sketches of the
components are also added to CADSketchNet. Using the sketch images from this
dataset, the paper also aims at evaluating the performance of various retrieval
system or a search engine for 3D CAD models that accepts a sketch image as the
input query. Many experimental models are constructed and tested on
CADSketchNet. These experiments, along with the model architecture, choice of
similarity metrics are reported along with the search results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purpose: To evaluate a fully-automated deep-learning-based method for
assessment of intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC). Methods: Two
observers manually delineated ICAC in non-contrast CT scans of 2,319
participants (mean age 69 (SD 7) years; 1154 women) of the Rotterdam Study,
prospectively collected between 2003 and 2006. These data were used to
retrospectively develop and validate a deep-learning-based method for automated
ICAC delineation and volume measurement. To evaluate the method, we compared
manual and automatic assessment (computed using ten-fold cross-validation) with
respect to 1) the agreement with an independent observer's assessment
(available in a random subset of 47 scans); 2) the accuracy in delineating ICAC
as judged via blinded visual comparison by an expert; 3) the association with
first stroke incidence from the scan date until 2012. All method performance
metrics were computed using 10-fold cross-validation. Results: The automated
delineation of ICAC reached sensitivity of 83.8% and positive predictive value
(PPV) of 88%. The intraclass correlation between automatic and manual ICAC
volume measures was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.97, 0.98; computed in the entire dataset).
Measured between the assessments of independent observers, sensitivity was
73.9%, PPV was 89.5%, and intraclass correlation was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.95;
computed in the 47-scan subset). In the blinded visual comparisons, automatic
delineations were more accurate than manual ones (p-value = 0.01). The
association of ICAC volume with incident stroke was similarly strong for both
automated (hazard ratio, 1.38 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.75) and manually measured
volumes (hazard ratio, 1.48 (95% CI: 1.20, 1.87)). Conclusions: The developed
model was capable of automated segmentation and volume quantification of ICAC
with accuracy comparable to human experts.]]></summary>

learning-based detection methods have achieved very promising results. In
general, these methods require exhaustively annotating the cells in an entire
image. If some of the cells are not annotated (imperfect annotation), the
detection performance significantly degrades due to noisy labels. This often
occurs in real collaborations with biologists and even in public data-sets. Our
proposed method takes a pseudo labeling approach for cell detection from
imperfect annotated data. A detection convolutional neural network (CNN)
trained using such missing labeled data often produces over-detection. We treat
partially labeled cells as positive samples and the detected positions except
for the labeled cell as unlabeled samples. Then we select reliable pseudo
labels from unlabeled data using recent machine learning techniques;
positive-and-unlabeled (PU) learning and P-classification. Experiments using

across the web, especially on social media websites used by half the world's
population. In this context, Face Recognition (FR) systems have the potential
to match faces to specific names and identities, creating glaring privacy
concerns. Adversarial attacks are a promising way to grant users privacy from
FR systems by disrupting their capability to recognize faces. Yet, such attacks
can be perceptible to human observers, especially under the more challenging
black-box threat model. In the literature, the justification for the
imperceptibility of such attacks hinges on bounding metrics such as $\ell_p$
norms. However, there is not much research on how these norms match up with
human perception. Through examining and measuring both the effectiveness of
recent black-box attacks in the face recognition setting and their
corresponding human perceptibility through survey data, we demonstrate the
trade-offs in perceptibility that occur as attacks become more aggressive. We
also show how the $\ell_2$ norm and other metrics do not correlate with human
perceptibility in a linear fashion, thus making these norms suboptimal at
measuring adversarial attack perceptibility.]]></summary>

suffering from the difficulty of the convergence of train-ing a GAN, the

this work, we find that the discriminatorcould be not necessary for

Auto-Encoder (SSAE)to generate the perturbations, which is composed of the
saliencymap module and the angle-norm disentanglement of the featuresmodule.
The advantage of our proposed method lies in that it is notdepending on

label-relevant regions. The extensive exper-iments among the various tasks,

ZstGAN: By introducing an adversarial training scheme, ZstGAN learns to model
each domain with domain-specific feature distribution that is semantically
consistent on vision and attribute modalities. Then the domain-invariant
features are disentangled with an shared encoder for image generation. We carry
out extensive experiments on CUB and FLO datasets, and the results demonstrate

prediction method by minimizing the fitting loss of the uncertain point.
Finally, we find out whether the bouncing point of the ball is out of bounds or

generators have alleviated the lack of annotated text images from the real
world. Specifically, they generate multiple text images with diverse
backgrounds, font styles, and text shapes and enable STR models to learn visual
patterns that might not be accessible from manually annotated data. In this
paper, we introduce a new synthetic text image generator, SynthTIGER, by
analyzing techniques used for text image synthesis and integrating effective
ones under a single algorithm. Moreover, we propose two techniques that
alleviate the long-tail problem in length and character distributions of
training data. In our experiments, SynthTIGER achieves better STR performance
than the combination of synthetic datasets, MJSynth (MJ) and SynthText (ST).
Our ablation study demonstrates the benefits of using sub-components of
SynthTIGER and the guideline on generating synthetic text images for STR
models. Our implementation is publicly available at

models from long-tailed data, generally assume the models would be evaluated on
the uniform test class distribution. However, the practical test class
distribution often violates such an assumption (e.g., being long-tailed or even
inversely long-tailed), which would lead existing methods to fail in real-world
applications. In this work, we study a more practical task setting, called
test-agnostic long-tailed recognition, where the training class distribution is
long-tailed while the test class distribution is unknown and can be skewed
arbitrarily. In addition to the issue of class imbalance, this task poses
another challenge: the class distribution shift between the training and test
samples is unidentified. To address this task, we propose a new method, called
Test-time Aggregating Diverse Experts (TADE), that presents two solution
strategies: (1) a novel skill-diverse expert learning strategy that trains
diverse experts to excel at handling different test distributions from a single
long-tailed training distribution; (2) a novel test-time expert aggregation
strategy that leverages self-supervision to aggregate multiple experts for
handling various test distributions. Moreover, we theoretically show that our
method has provable ability to simulate unknown test class distributions.
Promising results on both vanilla and test-agnostic long-tailed recognition
verify the effectiveness of TADE. Code is available at

recover realistic details for single image super-resolution (SISR). To further
improve the visual quality of super-resolved results, PIRM2018-SR Challenge
employed perceptual metrics to assess the perceptual quality, such as PI, NIQE,

Generative Adversarial Networks with Ranker (RankSRGAN) to optimize generator
in the direction of different perceptual metrics. Specifically, we first train
a Ranker which can learn the behaviour of perceptual metrics and then introduce
a novel rank-content loss to optimize the perceptual quality. The most
appealing part is that the proposed method can combine the strengths of
different SR methods to generate better results. Furthermore, we extend our
method to multiple Rankers to provide multi-dimension constraints for the

deep-learning-based global building change surveillance. In particular, the
scroll imaging mode of optical satellites enables larger observation ranges and
shorter revisit periods, facilitating efficient global surveillance. However,
the images in recent satellite change detection datasets are mainly captured at
near-nadir viewing angles. In this paper, we introduce S2Looking, a building
change detection dataset that contains large-scale side-looking satellite
images captured at varying off-nadir angles. Our S2Looking dataset consists of
5000 registered bitemporal image pairs (size of 1024*1024, 0.5 ~ 0.8 m/pixel)
of rural areas throughout the world and more than 65,920 annotated change
instances. We provide two label maps to separately indicate the newly built and
demolished building regions for each sample in the dataset. We establish a
benchmark task based on this dataset, i.e., identifying the pixel-level
building changes in the bi-temporal images. We test several state-of-the-art
methods on both the S2Looking dataset and the (near-nadir) LEVIR-CD+ dataset.
The experimental results show that recent change detection methods exhibit much
poorer performance on the S2Looking than on LEVIR-CD+. The proposed S2Looking
dataset presents three main challenges: 1) large viewing angle changes, 2)
large illumination variances and 3) various complex scene characteristics
encountered in rural areas. Our proposed dataset may promote the development of
algorithms for satellite image change detection and registration under
conditions of large off-nadir angles. The dataset is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Face recognition remains a challenging task in unconstrained scenarios,
especially when faces are partially occluded. To improve the robustness against
occlusion, augmenting the training images with artificial occlusions has been
proved as a useful approach. However, these artificial occlusions are commonly
generated by adding a black rectangle or several object templates including
sunglasses, scarfs and phones, which cannot well simulate the realistic
occlusions. In this paper, based on the argument that the occlusion essentially
damages a group of neurons, we propose a novel and elegant occlusion-simulation
method via dropping the activations of a group of neurons in some elaborately
selected channel. Specifically, we first employ a spatial regularization to
encourage each feature channel to respond to local and different face regions.
In this way, the activations affected by an occlusion in a local region are
more likely to be located in a single feature channel. Then, the locality-aware
channel-wise dropout (LCD) is designed to simulate the occlusion by dropping
out the entire feature channel. Furthermore, by randomly dropping out several
feature channels, our method can well simulate the occlusion of larger area.
The proposed LCD can encourage its succeeding layers to minimize the
intra-class feature variance caused by occlusions, thus leading to improved
robustness against occlusion. In addition, we design an auxiliary spatial
attention module by learning a channel-wise attention vector to reweight the
feature channels, which improves the contributions of non-occluded regions.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks show that the proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a remarkable improvement.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Automotive Cyber-Physical Systems (ACPS) have attracted a significant amount
of interest in the past few decades, while one of the most critical operations
in these systems is the perception of the environment. Deep learning and,
especially, the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) provides impressive results
in analyzing and understanding complex and dynamic scenes from visual data. The
prediction horizons for those perception systems are very short and inference
must often be performed in real time, stressing the need of transforming the
original large pre-trained networks into new smaller models, by utilizing Model
Compression and Acceleration (MCA) techniques. Our goal in this work is to
investigate best practices for appropriately applying novel weight sharing
techniques, optimizing the available variables and the training procedures
towards the significant acceleration of widely adopted DNNs. Extensive
evaluation studies carried out using various state-of-the-art DNN models in
object detection and tracking experiments, provide details about the type of
errors that manifest after the application of weight sharing techniques,
resulting in significant acceleration gains with negligible accuracy losses.]]></summary>

neural networks (CNNs) have difficulties generalising to unseen target domains.
When applied to segmentation of brain MRI scans, CNNs are highly sensitive to
changes in resolution and contrast: even within the same MR modality, decreases
in performance can be observed across datasets. We introduce SynthSeg, the
first segmentation CNN agnostic to brain MRI scans of any contrast and
resolution. SynthSeg is trained with synthetic data sampled from a generative
model inspired by Bayesian segmentation. Crucially, we adopt a \textit{domain
randomisation} strategy where we fully randomise the generation parameters to
maximise the variability of the training data. Consequently, SynthSeg can
segment preprocessed and unpreprocessed real scans of any target domain,
without retraining or fine-tuning. Because SynthSeg only requires segmentations
to be trained (no images), it can learn from label maps obtained automatically
from existing datasets of different populations (e.g., with atrophy and
lesions), thus achieving robustness to a wide range of morphological
variability. We demonstrate SynthSeg on 5,500 scans of 6 modalities and 10
resolutions, where it exhibits unparalleled generalisation compared to
supervised CNNs, test time adaptation, and Bayesian segmentation. The code and
trained model are available at https://github.com/BBillot/SynthSeg.]]></summary>

across all industries, such as disease diagnosis in healthcare or quality
assurance in manufacturing. Manual inspection of images, when extended over a
monotonously repetitive period of time is very time consuming and can lead to
anomalies being overlooked.Artificial neural networks have proven themselves
very successful on simple, repetitive tasks, in some cases even outperforming
humans. Therefore, in this paper we investigate different methods of deep
learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, for anomaly detection
applied to a quality assurance use case. We utilize the MVTec anomaly dataset
and develop three different models, a CNN for supervised anomaly detection,
KD-CAE for autoencoder anomaly detection, NI-CAE for noise induced anomaly
detection and a DCGAN for generating reconstructed images. By experiments, we
found that KD-CAE performs better on the anomaly datasets compared to CNN and
NI-CAE, with NI-CAE performing the best on the Transistor dataset. We also
implemented a DCGAN for the creation of new training data but due to
computational limitation and lack of extrapolating the mechanics of AnoGAN, we
restricted ourselves just to the generation of GAN based images. We conclude
that unsupervised methods are more powerful for anomaly detection in images,
especially in a setting where only a small amount of anomalous data is
available, or the data is unlabeled.]]></summary>

for the development of reliable intelligent agents, such as self-driving cars
or robot assistants. While the ability to make future predictions with high
accuracy is crucial for designing the anticipation approaches, the speed at
which the inference is performed is not less important. Methods that are
accurate but not sufficiently fast would introduce a high latency into the
decision process. Thus, this will increase the reaction time of the underlying
system. This poses a problem for domains such as autonomous driving, where the
reaction time is crucial. In this work, we propose a simple and effective
multi-modal architecture based on temporal convolutions. Our approach stacks a
hierarchy of temporal convolutional layers and does not rely on recurrent
layers to ensure a fast prediction. We further introduce a multi-modal fusion
mechanism that captures the pairwise interactions between RGB, flow, and object
modalities. Results on two large-scale datasets of egocentric videos,
EPIC-Kitchens-55 and EPIC-Kitchens-100, show that our approach achieves
comparable performance to the state-of-the-art approaches while being

talking-head videos from a single reference image. In this work, we tackle two
key challenges: (i) producing natural head motions that match speech prosody,
and (ii) maintaining the appearance of a speaker in a large head motion while
stabilizing the non-face regions. We first design a head pose predictor by
modeling rigid 6D head movements with a motion-aware recurrent neural network
(RNN). In this way, the predicted head poses act as the low-frequency holistic
movements of a talking head, thus allowing our latter network to focus on
detailed facial movement generation. To depict the entire image motions arising
from audio, we exploit a keypoint based dense motion field representation.
Then, we develop a motion field generator to produce the dense motion fields
from input audio, head poses, and a reference image. As this keypoint based
representation models the motions of facial regions, head, and backgrounds
integrally, our method can better constrain the spatial and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. Finally, an image generation network is
employed to render photo-realistic talking-head videos from the estimated
keypoint based motion fields and the input reference image. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method produces videos with plausible head
motions, synchronized facial expressions, and stable backgrounds and
outperforms the state-of-the-art.]]></summary>

for learning latent fine-grained structure in the embedding space. Furthermore,
to overcome the drawbacks of random image transformation used in current
contrastive learning in producing noisy and inaccurate image pairs (i.e.,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Near infrared (NIR) imaging has been widely applied in low-light imaging
scenarios; however, it is difficult for human and algorithms to perceive the
real scene in the colorless NIR domain. While Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) has been widely employed in various image colorization tasks, it is
challenging for a direct mapping mechanism, such as a conventional GAN, to
transform an image from the NIR to the RGB domain with correct semantic
reasoning, well-preserved textures, and vivid color combinations concurrently.
In this work, we propose a novel Attention-based NIR image colorization
framework via Adaptive Fusion of Semantic and Texture clues, aiming at
achieving these goals within the same framework. The tasks of texture transfer
and semantic reasoning are carried out in two separate network blocks.
Specifically, the Texture Transfer Block (TTB) aims at extracting texture
features from the NIR image's Laplacian component and transferring them for
subsequent color fusion. The Semantic Reasoning Block (SRB) extracts semantic
clues and maps the NIR pixel values to the RGB domain. Finally, a Fusion
Attention Block (FAB) is proposed to adaptively fuse the features from the two
branches and generate an optimized colorization result. In order to enhance the
network's learning capacity in semantic reasoning as well as mapping precision
in texture transfer, we have proposed the Residual Coordinate Attention Block
(RCAB), which incorporates coordinate attention into a residual learning
framework, enabling the network to capture long-range dependencies along the
channel direction and meanwhile precise positional information can be preserved
along spatial directions. RCAB is also incorporated into FAB to facilitate
accurate texture alignment during fusion. Both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art NIR
image colorization methods.]]></summary>

generalized SLU in commercial voice assistants (VAs). We propose a fully
differentiable, transformer-based, hierarchical system that can be pretrained
at both the ASR and NLU levels. This is then fine-tuned on both transcription

argument combinations. This leads to an SLU system that achieves significant
improvements over baselines on a complex internal generalized VA dataset with a
43% improvement in accuracy, while still meeting the 99% accuracy benchmark on
the popular Fluent Speech Commands dataset. We further evaluate our model on a

convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Although CNNs offer promising
perspectives for 2D image compression, extending such models to omnidirectional
images is not straightforward. First, omnidirectional images have specific
spatial and statistical properties that can not be fully captured by current
CNN models. Second, basic mathematical operations composing a CNN architecture,
e.g., translation and sampling, are not well-defined on the sphere. In this
paper, we study the learning of representation models for omnidirectional
images and propose to use the properties of HEALPix uniform sampling of the
sphere to redefine the mathematical tools used in deep learning models for
omnidirectional images. In particular, we: i) propose the definition of a new
convolution operation on the sphere that keeps the high expressiveness and the
low complexity of a classical 2D convolution; ii) adapt standard CNN techniques
such as stride, iterative aggregation, and pixel shuffling to the spherical
domain; and then iii) apply our new framework to the task of omnidirectional
image compression. Our experiments show that our proposed on-the-sphere
solution leads to a better compression gain that can save 13.7% of the bit rate
compared to similar learned models applied to equirectangular images. Also,
compared to learning models based on graph convolutional networks, our solution
supports more expressive filters that can preserve high frequencies and provide
a better perceptual quality of the compressed images. Such results demonstrate
the efficiency of the proposed framework, which opens new research venues for
other omnidirectional vision tasks to be effectively implemented on the sphere
manifold.]]></summary>

mentioned in the question, such as objects and people. VQA methods should be
able to compose skills and concepts in novel ways, regardless of whether the
specific composition has been seen in training, yet we demonstrate that
existing models have much to improve upon towards handling new compositions. We
present a novel method for learning to compose skills and concepts that
separates these two factors implicitly within a model by learning grounded
concept representations and disentangling the encoding of skills from that of
concepts. We enforce these properties with a novel contrastive learning

Resonance (MR) image acquisition can cause image artifacts. Motion correction
techniques have been proposed to compensate for these types of motion during
thoracic scans, relying on accurate motion estimation from undersampled
motion-resolved reconstruction. A particular interest and challenge lie in the
derivation of reliable non-rigid motion fields from the undersampled
motion-resolved data. Motion estimation is usually formulated in image space
via diffusion, parametric-spline, or optical flow methods. However, image-based
registration can be impaired by remaining aliasing artifacts due to the
undersampled motion-resolved reconstruction. In this work, we describe a
formalism to perform non-rigid registration directly in the sampled Fourier
space, i.e. k-space. We propose a deep-learning based approach to perform fast
and accurate non-rigid registration from the undersampled k-space data. The
basic working principle originates from the Local All-Pass (LAP) technique, a
recently introduced optical flow-based registration. The proposed LAPNet is
compared against traditional and deep learning image-based registrations and
tested on fully-sampled and highly-accelerated (with two undersampling
strategies) 3D respiratory motion-resolved MR images in a cohort of 40 patients
with suspected liver or lung metastases and 25 healthy subjects. The proposed
LAPNet provided consistent and superior performance to image-based approaches
throughout different sampling trajectories and acceleration factors.]]></summary>

imaging due to their promising pattern recognition capabilities. However, Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs) require a huge amount of data, and because of the lack

DNNs used for disease diagnosis meticulously concentrate on improving the
accuracy of predictions without providing a figure about their confidence of
predictions. Knowing how much a DNN model is confident in a computer-aided
diagnosis model is necessary for gaining clinicians' confidence and trust in
DL-based solutions. To address this issue, this work presents three different
methods for quantifying uncertainties for skin cancer detection from images. It
also comprehensively evaluates and compares performance of these DNNs using
novel uncertainty-related metrics. The obtained results reveal that the
predictive uncertainty estimation methods are capable of flagging risky and
erroneous predictions with a high uncertainty estimate. We also demonstrate
that ensemble approaches are more reliable in capturing uncertainties through

long-standing challenge of Earth observation, particularly across different
modalities such as optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Here, we
explore the joint analysis of imagery from different sensors in the light of
representation learning: we propose to learn a joint, sensor-invariant
embedding (feature representation) within a deep neural network. Our
application problem is the monitoring of lake ice on Alpine lakes. To reach the
temporal resolution requirement of the Swiss Global Climate Observing System
(GCOS) office, we combine three image sources: Sentinel-1 SAR (S1-SAR), Terra
MODIS and Suomi-NPP VIIRS. The large gaps between the optical and SAR domains
and between the sensor resolutions make this a challenging instance of the
sensor fusion problem. Our approach can be classified as a feature-level fusion
that is learnt in a data-driven manner. The proposed network architecture has
separate encoding branches for each image sensor, which feed into a single
latent embedding. I.e., a common feature representation shared by all inputs,
such that subsequent processing steps deliver comparable output irrespective of
which sort of input image was used. By fusing satellite data, we map lake ice
at a temporal resolution of <1.5 days. The network produces spatially explicit
lake ice maps with pixel-wise accuracies >91.3% (respectively, mIoU scores
>60.7%) and generalises well across different lakes and winters. Moreover, it
sets a new state-of-the-art for determining the important ice-on and ice-off

depending on specific situations. Indeed, the way in which words are
instantiated and associated represents a particularly interesting aspect that
can substantially help to better understand the context in which they are

concepts that are currently related to some of the main standing challenges in
science. More specifically, the study reported here takes into account the
words "prediction", "model", "optimization", "complex", "entropy", "random",
"deterministic", "pattern", and "database". In order to complement the

of the words were observed to have markedly distinct associations in different

two novel sub-tasks of this problem, and provide a corresponding dialogue-level
dataset, along with strong Transformer-based baselines. The dataset is
available at https://github.com/declare-lab/RECCON.

Introduction: Recognizing the cause behind emotions in text is a fundamental
yet under-explored area of research in NLP. Advances in this area hold the
potential to improve interpretability and performance in affect-based models.
Identifying emotion causes at the utterance level in conversations is
particularly challenging due to the intermingling dynamics among the
interlocutors.

Method: We introduce the task of Recognizing Emotion Cause in CONversations
with an accompanying dataset named \RECCONDA, containing over 1,000 dialogues
and 10,000 utterance cause-effect pairs. Furthermore, we define different cause
types based on the source of the causes, and establish strong Transformer-based
baselines to address two different sub-tasks on this dataset: causal span
extraction and causal emotion entailment.

Result: Our Transformer-based baselines, which leverage contextual
pre-trained embeddings, such as RoBERTa, outperform the state-of-the-art
emotion cause extraction approaches

Conclusion: We introduce a new task highly relevant for (explainable)
emotion-aware artificial intelligence: recognizing emotion cause in
conversations, provide a new highly challenging publicly available
dialogue-level dataset for this task, and give strong baseline results on this
dataset.]]></summary>

a platform for people to express their opinions on various topics. A wide
variety of views accompanies COVID-19 vaccination drives across the globe,
often colored by emotions, which change along with rising cases, approval of
vaccines, and multiple factors discussed online. This study aims at analyzing
the temporal evolution of different Emotion categories: Hesitation, Rage,
Sorrow, Anticipation, Faith, and Contentment with Influencing Factors: Vaccine
Rollout, Misinformation, Health Effects, and Inequities as lexical categories
created from Tweets belonging to five countries with vital vaccine roll-out
programs, namely, India, United States of America, Brazil, United Kingdom, and
Australia. We extracted a corpus of nearly 1.8 million Twitter posts related to
COVID-19 vaccination. Using cosine distance from selected seed words, we
expanded the vocabulary of each category and tracked the longitudinal change in
their strength from June 2020 to April 2021. We used community detection
algorithms to find modules in positive correlation networks. Our findings
suggest that tweets expressing hesitancy towards vaccines contain the highest
mentions of health-related effects in all countries. Our results indicated that
the patterns of hesitancy were variable across geographies and can help us
learn targeted interventions. We also observed a significant change in the
linear trends of categories like hesitation and contentment before and after
approval of vaccines. Negative emotions like rage and sorrow gained the highest
importance in the alluvial diagram. They formed a significant module with all
the influencing factors in April 2021, when India observed the second wave of
COVID-19 cases. The relationship between Emotions and Influencing Factors was
found to be variable across the countries.]]></summary>

options. It is well-known that, when sufficiently young children encounter a
new word, they tend to interpret it as pointing to a meaning that does not have
a word yet in their lexicon rather than to a meaning that already has a word
attached. In previous research, the strategy was shown to be optimal from an
information theoretic standpoint. In that framework, interpretation is
hypothesized to be driven by the minimization of a cost function: the option of
least communication cost is chosen. However, the information theoretic model
employed in that research neither explains the weakening of that vocabulary
learning bias in older children or polylinguals nor reproduces Zipf's
meaning-frequency law, namely the non-linear relationship between the number of
meanings of a word and its frequency. Here we consider a generalization of the
model that is channeled to reproduce that law. The analysis of the new model
reveals regions of the phase space where the bias disappears consistently with
the weakening or loss of the bias in older children or polylinguals. The model
is abstract enough to support future research on other levels of life that are
relevant to biosemiotics. In the deep learning era, the model is a transparent
low-dimensional tool for future experimental research and illustrates the
predictive power of a theoretical framework originally designed to shed light
on the origins of Zipf's rank-frequency law.]]></summary>

networks. In this paper, we propose a fully hyperbolic framework to build
hyperbolic networks based on the Lorentz model by adapting the Lorentz
transformations (including boost and rotation) to formalize essential
operations of neural networks. Moreover, we also prove that linear
transformation in tangent spaces used by existing hyperbolic networks is a
relaxation of the Lorentz rotation and does not include the boost, implicitly

primary clinical advice and diagnoses. It has been gradually adopted and
practiced in medical organizations in the form of a conversational bot, largely
due to the advancement of NLP. In recent years, the introduction of
state-of-the-art deep learning models and transfer learning techniques like
Universal Language Model Fine Tuning (ULMFiT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD)
largely contributes to the performance of NLP tasks. However, some deep neural
networks are poorly calibrated and wrongly estimate the uncertainty. Hence the
model is not trustworthy, especially in sensitive medical decision-making
systems and safety tasks. In this paper, we investigate the well-calibrated
model for ULMFiT and self-distillation (SD) in a medical dialogue system. The
calibrated ULMFiT (CULMFiT) is obtained by incorporating label smoothing (LS),
a commonly used regularization technique to achieve a well-calibrated model.
Moreover, we apply the technique to recalibrate the confidence score called
temperature scaling (TS) with KD to observe its correlation with network
calibration. To further understand the relation between SD and calibration, we
use both fixed and optimal temperatures to fine-tune the whole model. All
experiments are conducted on the consultation backpain dataset collected by
experts then further validated using a large publicly medial dialogue corpus.
We empirically show that our proposed methodologies outperform conventional
methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.]]></summary>

study of different configurations. A single-language system with an appropriate
programming model and compiler that targets both platforms simplifies this
exploration to a simple recompile with new compiler directives.

This work introduces StreamBlocks, an open-source compiler and runtime that
uses the CAL dataflow programming language to partition computations across
heterogeneous (CPU/accelerator) platforms. Because of the dataflow model's
semantics and the CAL language, StreamBlocks can exploit both thread
parallelism in multi-core CPUs and the inherent parallelism of FPGAs.
StreamBlocks supports exploring the design space with a profile-guided tool
that helps identify the best hardware-software partitions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detecting customized moments and highlights from videos given natural
language (NL) user queries is an important but under-studied topic. One of the
challenges in pursuing this direction is the lack of annotated data. To address
this issue, we present the Query-based Video Highlights (QVHighlights) dataset.
It consists of over 10,000 YouTube videos, covering a wide range of topics,
from everyday activities and travel in lifestyle vlog videos to social and
political activities in news videos. Each video in the dataset is annotated
with: (1) a human-written free-form NL query, (2) relevant moments in the video
w.r.t. the query, and (3) five-point scale saliency scores for all
query-relevant clips. This comprehensive annotation enables us to develop and
evaluate systems that detect relevant moments as well as salient highlights for
diverse, flexible user queries. We also present a strong baseline for this
task, Moment-DETR, a transformer encoder-decoder model that views moment
retrieval as a direct set prediction problem, taking extracted video and query
representations as inputs and predicting moment coordinates and saliency scores
end-to-end. While our model does not utilize any human prior, we show that it
performs competitively when compared to well-engineered architectures. With
weakly supervised pretraining using ASR captions, Moment-DETR substantially
outperforms previous methods. Lastly, we present several ablations and
visualizations of Moment-DETR. Data and code is publicly available at

processing, most approaches only target flat entities, ignoring nested
structures which are common in many scenarios. Most existing nested NER methods
traverse all sub-sequences which is both expensive and inefficient, and also
don't well consider boundary knowledge which is significant for nested
entities. In this paper, we propose a joint entity mention detection and typing
model via prior boundary knowledge (BoningKnife) to better handle nested NER
extraction and recognition tasks. BoningKnife consists of two modules,
MentionTagger and TypeClassifier. MentionTagger better leverages boundary
knowledge beyond just entity start/end to improve the handling of nesting
levels and longer spans, while generating high quality mention candidates.
TypeClassifier utilizes a two-level attention mechanism to decouple different
nested level representations and better distinguish entity types. We jointly
train both modules sharing a common representation and a new dual-info
attention layer, which leads to improved representation focus on entity-related
information. Experiments over different datasets show that our approach
outperforms previous state of the art methods and achieves 86.41, 85.46, and
94.2 F1 scores on ACE2004, ACE2005, and NNE, respectively.]]></summary>

ASR+TTS, overlooks the modeling of prosody, which plays an important role in
speech naturalness and conversion similarity. Although some researchers have
considered transferring prosodic clues from the source speech, there arises a
speaker mismatch during training and conversion. To address this issue, in this
work, we propose to directly predict prosody from the linguistic representation

Our new dataset WikiGraphs is collected by pairing each Wikipedia article from

from the Freebase knowledge graph (Bollacker et al., 2008). This makes it easy
to benchmark against other state-of-the-art text generative models that are
capable of generating long paragraphs of coherent text. Both the graphs and the
text data are of significantly larger scale compared to prior graph-text paired

videos from a multi-antenna base station (BS) to one or multiple single-antenna
users, respectively, in a multi-carrier wireless system. We aim to maximize the
video quality while keeping rebuffering time small via encoding rate adaptation
at each group of pictures (GOP) and transmission adaptation at each
(transmission) slot. To capture the impact of field-of-view (FoV) prediction,
we consider three cases of FoV viewing probability distributions, i.e.,
perfect, imperfect, and unknown FoV viewing probability distributions, and use
the average total utility, worst average total utility, and worst total utility
as the respective performance metrics. In the single-user scenario, we optimize
the encoding rates of the tiles, encoding rates of the FoVs, and transmission
beamforming vectors for all subcarriers to maximize the total utility in each
case. In the multi-user scenario, we adopt rate splitting with successive
decoding and optimize the encoding rates of the tiles, encoding rates of the
FoVs, rates of the common and private messages, and transmission beamforming
vectors for all subcarriers to maximize the total utility in each case. Then,
we separate the challenging optimization problem into multiple tractable
problems in each scenario. In the single-user scenario, we obtain a globally
optimal solution of each problem using transformation techniques and the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. In the multi-user scenario, we obtain a
KKT point of each problem using the concave-convex procedure (CCCP). Finally,
numerical results demonstrate that the proposed solutions achieve notable gains
over existing schemes in all three cases. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work revealing the impact of FoV prediction on the performance of
adaptive streaming of tiled 360 videos.]]></summary>

talking-head videos from a single reference image. In this work, we tackle two
key challenges: (i) producing natural head motions that match speech prosody,
and (ii) maintaining the appearance of a speaker in a large head motion while
stabilizing the non-face regions. We first design a head pose predictor by
modeling rigid 6D head movements with a motion-aware recurrent neural network
(RNN). In this way, the predicted head poses act as the low-frequency holistic
movements of a talking head, thus allowing our latter network to focus on
detailed facial movement generation. To depict the entire image motions arising
from audio, we exploit a keypoint based dense motion field representation.
Then, we develop a motion field generator to produce the dense motion fields
from input audio, head poses, and a reference image. As this keypoint based
representation models the motions of facial regions, head, and backgrounds
integrally, our method can better constrain the spatial and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. Finally, an image generation network is
employed to render photo-realistic talking-head videos from the estimated
keypoint based motion fields and the input reference image. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method produces videos with plausible head
motions, synchronized facial expressions, and stable backgrounds and
outperforms the state-of-the-art.]]></summary>

growth in the inflation rate has compelled people to invest in the stock and
commodity markets and other areas rather than saving. Further, the ability of
Deep Learning models to make predictions on the time series data has been
proven time and again. Technical analysis on the stock market with the help of
technical indicators has been the most common practice among traders and
investors. One more aspect is the sentiment analysis - the emotion of the
investors that shows the willingness to invest. A variety of techniques have
been used by people around the globe involving basic Machine Learning and
Neural Networks. Ranging from the basic linear regression to the advanced
neural networks people have experimented with all possible techniques to
predict the stock market. It's evident from recent events how news and
headlines affect the stock markets and cryptocurrencies. This paper proposes an
ensemble of state-of-the-art methods for predicting stock prices. Firstly
sentiment analysis of the news and the headlines for the company Apple Inc,
listed on the NASDAQ is performed using a version of BERT, which is a
pre-trained transformer model by Google for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Afterward, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) predicts the stock price for
Apple Inc using the technical indicators, stock indexes of various countries,
some commodities, and historical prices along with the sentiment scores.
Comparison is done with baseline models like - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM),
Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), vanilla GAN, and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) model.]]></summary>

Question Answering (VQA) models. To measure generalization to novel questions,
we propose to separate them into "skills" and "concepts". "Skills" are visual
tasks, such as counting or attribute recognition, and are applied to "concepts"
mentioned in the question, such as objects and people. VQA methods should be
able to compose skills and concepts in novel ways, regardless of whether the
specific composition has been seen in training, yet we demonstrate that
existing models have much to improve upon towards handling new compositions. We
present a novel method for learning to compose skills and concepts that
separates these two factors implicitly within a model by learning grounded
concept representations and disentangling the encoding of skills from that of
concepts. We enforce these properties with a novel contrastive learning
procedure that does not rely on external annotations and can be learned from
unlabeled image-question pairs. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach for improving compositional and grounding performance.]]></summary>

natural language is the most effective mode of interaction with humans, these
exchanges are rarely used as an opportunity for learning. Leveraging language
interactions effectively requires addressing limitations in the two most common
approaches to language grounding: semantic parsers built on top of fixed object
categories are precise but inflexible and end-to-end models are maximally
expressive, but fickle and opaque. Our goal is to develop a system that
balances the strengths of each approach so that users can teach agents new
instructions that generalize broadly from a single example. We introduce the
idea of neural abstructions: a set of constraints on the inference procedure of
a label-conditioned generative model that can affect the meaning of the label
in context. Starting from a core programming language that operates over
abstructions, users can define increasingly complex mappings from natural
language to actions. We show that with this method a user population is able to
build a semantic parser for an open-ended house modification task in Minecraft.
The semantic parser that results is both flexible and expressive: the
percentage of utterances sourced from redefinitions increases steadily over the
course of 191 total exchanges, achieving a final value of 28%.]]></summary>

still very useful, e.g, Search Engines (Google Chrome). Speeding them up, in
small additional space with respect to the table being searched into, is still
a quite significant achievement. Static Learned Indexes have been very
successful in achieving such a speed-up, but leave open a major question: To
what extent one can enjoy the speed-up of Learned Indexes while using constant
or nearly constant additional space. By generalizing the experimental
methodology of a recent benchmarking study on Learned Indexes, we shed light on
this question, by considering two scenarios. The first, quite elementary, i.e.,
textbook code, and the second using advanced Learned Indexing algorithms and
the supporting sophisticated software platforms. Although in both cases one
would expect a positive answer, its achievement is not as simple as it seems.
Indeed, our extensive set of experiments reveal a complex relationship between
query time and model space. The findings regarding this relationship and the
corresponding quantitative estimates, across memory levels, can be of interest
to algorithm designers and of use to practitioners as well. As an essential
part of our research, we introduce two new models that are of interest in their

implicitly encode likelihood functions of complex systems. Classical
statistical methods are poorly suited for these so-called likelihood-free
inference (LFI) settings, outside the asymptotic and low-dimensional regimes.
Although new machine learning methods, such as normalizing flows, have
revolutionized the sample efficiency and capacity of LFI methods, it remains an
open question whether they produce reliable measures of uncertainty. This paper
presents a statistical framework for LFI that unifies classical statistics with
modern machine learning to: (1) efficiently construct frequentist confidence
sets and hypothesis tests with finite-sample guarantees of nominal coverage
(type I error control) and power; (2) provide practical diagnostics for
assessing empirical coverage over the entire parameter space. We refer to our
framework as likelihood-free frequentist inference (LF2I). Any method that
estimates a test statistic, like the likelihood ratio, can be plugged into our
framework to create valid confidence sets and compute diagnostics, without
costly Monte Carlo samples at fixed parameter settings. In this work, we
specifically study the power of two test statistics (ACORE and BFF), which,
respectively, maximize versus integrate an odds function over the parameter

total reward while obeying safety constraints. Although much recent research
has focused on the development of safe reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
that produce a safe policy after training, ensuring safety during training as
well remains an open problem. A fundamental challenge is performing exploration
while still satisfying constraints in an unknown Markov decision process (MDP).
In this work, we address this problem for the chance-constrained setting. We
propose a new algorithm, SAILR, that uses an intervention mechanism based on
advantage functions to keep the agent safe throughout training and optimizes
the agent's policy using off-the-shelf RL algorithms designed for unconstrained
MDPs. Our method comes with strong guarantees on safety during both training
and deployment (i.e., after training and without the intervention mechanism)
and policy performance compared to the optimal safety-constrained policy. In

generates a strong demand for explanations that are robust to noise and align
well with human intuition. Most existing methods generate explanations by
identifying a subgraph of an input graph that has a strong correlation with the
prediction. These explanations are not robust to noise because independently
optimizing the correlation for a single input can easily overfit noise.
Moreover, they do not align well with human intuition because removing an
identified subgraph from an input graph does not necessarily change the
prediction result. In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate robust
counterfactual explanations on GNNs by explicitly modelling the common decision
logic of GNNs on similar input graphs. Our explanations are naturally robust to
noise because they are produced from the common decision boundaries of a GNN
that govern the predictions of many similar input graphs. The explanations also
align well with human intuition because removing the set of edges identified by
an explanation from the input graph changes the prediction significantly.
Exhaustive experiments on many public datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our method.]]></summary>

observations are taken either of the atmosphere or looking through the
atmosphere. Atmospheric correction errors can significantly alter the spectral
signature of the observations, and lead to invalid classifications or target
detection. This is even more crucial when working with hyperspectral data,
where a precise measurement of spectral properties is required.
State-of-the-art physics-based atmospheric correction approaches require
extensive prior knowledge about sensor characteristics, collection geometry,
and environmental characteristics of the scene being collected. These
approaches are computationally expensive, prone to inaccuracy due to lack of
sufficient environmental and collection information, and often impossible for
real-time applications. In this paper, a geometry-dependent hybrid neural
network is proposed for automatic atmospheric correction using multi-scan
hyperspectral data collected from different geometries. The proposed network
can characterize the atmosphere without any additional meteorological data. A
grid-search method is also proposed to solve the temperature emissivity
separation problem. Results show that the proposed network has the capacity to
accurately characterize the atmosphere and estimate target emissivity spectra
with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) under 0.02 for 29 different materials. This
solution can lead to accurate atmospheric correction to improve target
detection for real time applications.]]></summary>

generating mind-blowing photorealistic images that mimic the content of
datasets they were trained to replicate. One recurrent theme in medical imaging
is whether GANs can also be effective at generating workable medical data as
they are for generating realistic RGB images. In this paper, we perform a
multi-GAN and multi-application study to gauge the benefits of GANs in medical
imaging. We tested various GAN architectures from basic DCGAN to more
sophisticated style-based GANs on three medical imaging modalities and organs
namely : cardiac cine-MRI, liver CT and RGB retina images. GANs were trained on
well-known and widely utilized datasets from which their FID score were
computed to measure the visual acuity of their generated images. We further
tested their usefulness by measuring the segmentation accuracy of a U-Net
trained on these generated images.

Results reveal that GANs are far from being equal as some are ill-suited for
medical imaging applications while others are much better off. The
top-performing GANs are capable of generating realistic-looking medical images
by FID standards that can fool trained experts in a visual Turing test and
comply to some metrics. However, segmentation results suggests that no GAN is
capable of reproducing the full richness of a medical datasets.]]></summary>

Unlike fully unsupervised hierarchical clustering, the choice of grouping and
complexity criteria stems naturally from supervision in the training set. The
resulting method, Hi-LANDER, achieves an average of 54% improvement in F-score

that allows a large number of clients to train a joint model without the need
to share their private data. Participants instead only share ephemeral updates
necessary to train the model. To ensure the confidentiality of the client
updates, Federated Learning systems employ secure aggregation; clients encrypt
their gradient updates, and only the aggregated model is revealed to the
server. Achieving this level of data protection, however, presents new
challenges to the robustness of Federated Learning, i.e., the ability to
tolerate failures and attacks. Unfortunately, in this setting, a malicious
client can now easily exert influence on the model behavior without being
detected. As Federated Learning is being deployed in practice in a range of
sensitive applications, its robustness is growing in importance. In this paper,
we take a step towards understanding and improving the robustness of secure
Federated Learning. We start this paper with a systematic study that evaluates
and analyzes existing attack vectors and discusses potential defenses and
assesses their effectiveness. We then present RoFL, a secure Federated Learning
system that improves robustness against malicious clients through input checks
on the encrypted model updates. RoFL extends Federated Learning's secure
aggregation protocol to allow expressing a variety of properties and
constraints on model updates using zero-knowledge proofs. To enable RoFL to
scale to typical Federated Learning settings, we introduce several ML and
cryptographic optimizations specific to Federated Learning. We implement and
evaluate a prototype of RoFL and show that realistic ML models can be trained

algorithms can efficiently classify a wide range of quantum phases of matter.
Our arguments are based on the concept of a classical shadow, a succinct
classical description of a many-body quantum state that can be constructed in
feasible quantum experiments and be used to predict many properties of the

significant damage can be caused if an attacker is able to modify the code of
their programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Unfortunately, traditional
techniques for attesting code integrity (i.e. verifying that it has not been
modified) rely on firmware access or roots-of-trust, neither of which
proprietary or legacy PLCs are likely to provide. In this paper, we propose a
practical code integrity checking solution based on privacy-preserving black
box models that instead attest the input/output behaviour of PLC programs.
Using faithful offline copies of the PLC programs, we identify their most
important inputs through an information flow analysis, execute them on multiple
combinations to collect data, then train neural networks able to predict PLC
outputs (i.e. actuator commands) from their inputs. By exploiting the black box
nature of the model, our solution maintains the privacy of the original PLC
code and does not assume that attackers are unaware of its presence. The trust
instead comes from the fact that it is extremely hard to attack the PLC code
and neural networks at the same time and with consistent outcomes. We evaluated
our approach on a modern six-stage water treatment plant testbed, finding that
it could predict actuator states from PLC inputs with near-100% accuracy, and
thus could detect all 120 effective code mutations that we subjected the PLCs
to. Finally, we found that it is not practically possible to simultaneously
modify the PLC code and apply discreet adversarial noise to our attesters in a
way that leads to consistent (mis-)predictions.]]></summary>

concepts. Deep learning classifiers link the most basic version of concepts at
the input layer to the most abstract version of concepts at the output layer,
also known as a class or label. However, once trained over a finite set of
classes, some deep learning models do not have the power to say that a given
input does not belong to any of the classes and simply cannot be linked.
Correctly invalidating the prediction of unrelated classes is a challenging
problem that has been tackled in many ways in the literature. Novelty detection
gives deep learning the ability to output "do not know" for novel/unseen
classes. Still, no attention has been given to the security aspects of novelty
detection. In this paper, we consider the case study of abstraction-based
novelty detection and show that it is not robust against adversarial samples.
Moreover, we show the feasibility of crafting adversarial samples that fool the
deep learning classifier and bypass the novelty detection monitoring at the

networks have direct parallels in finite state machines, allowing clear
discussion and thought around architecture variants or trained models,
Transformers have no such familiar parallel. In this paper we aim to change
that, proposing a computational model for the transformer-encoder in the form
of a programming language. We map the basic components of a transformer-encoder
-- attention and feed-forward computation -- into simple primitives, around
which we form a programming language: the Restricted Access Sequence Processing
Language (RASP). We show how RASP can be used to program solutions to tasks
that could conceivably be learned by a Transformer, and how a Transformer can
be trained to mimic a RASP solution. In particular, we provide RASP programs
for histograms, sorting, and Dyck-languages. We further use our model to relate
their difficulty in terms of the number of required layers and attention heads:
analyzing a RASP program implies a maximum number of heads and layers necessary
to encode a task in a transformer. Finally, we see how insights gained from our
abstraction might be used to explain phenomena seen in recent works.]]></summary>

learning and deep learning. However, computing discrete optimal transport plan
for large scale problems with adequate accuracy and efficiency is still highly
challenging. Recently, methods based on the Sinkhorn algorithm add an entropy
regularizer to the prime problem and get a trade off between efficiency and
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to further improve the
efficiency and accuracy based on Nesterov's smoothing technique. Basically, the
non-smooth c-transform of the Kantorovich potential is approximated by the
smooth Log-Sum-Exp function, which finally smooths the original non-smooth
Kantorovich dual functional (energy). The smooth Kantorovich functional can be
optimized by the fast proximal gradient algorithm (FISTA) efficiently.
Theoretically, the computational complexity of the proposed method is given by
$O(n^{\frac{5}{2}} \sqrt{\log n} /\epsilon)$, which is lower than that of the
Sinkhorn algorithm. Empirically, compared with the Sinkhorn algorithm, our
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves faster
convergence and better accuracy with the same parameter.]]></summary>

on unseen target domains with different statistics, is a challenging problem.
While many approaches have been proposed to solve this problem, they only
utilize source data during training but do not take advantage of the fact that
a single target example is available at the time of inference. Motivated by
this, we propose a method that effectively uses the target sample during
inference beyond mere classification. Our method has three components - (i) A
label-preserving feature or metric transformation on source data such that the
source samples are clustered in accordance with their class irrespective of
their domain (ii) A generative model trained on the these features (iii) A
label-preserving projection of the target point on the source-feature manifold
during inference via solving an optimization problem on the input space of the
generative model using the learned metric. Finally, the projected target is
used in the classifier. Since the projected target feature comes from the
source manifold and has the same label as the real target by design, the
classifier is expected to perform better on it than the true target. We
demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art Domain
Generalization methods on multiple datasets and tasks.]]></summary>

requirements (e.g., collecting outlier data and hyperparameter validation) and
produce side effects (classification accuracy drop and slow/inefficient
inferences). Recently, entropic out-of-distribution detection has been proposed
as a seamless approach (i.e., a solution that avoids all the previously
mentioned drawbacks). The entropic out-of-distribution detection solution
comprises the IsoMax loss for training and the entropic score for
out-of-distribution detection. The IsoMax loss works as a SoftMax loss drop-in
replacement because swapping the SoftMax loss with the IsoMax loss requires no
changes in the model's architecture or training procedures/hyperparameters. In
this paper, we propose to perform what we call an isometrization of the
distances used in the IsoMax loss. Additionally, we propose to replace the
entropic score with the minimum distance score. Our experiments showed that
these simple modifications increase out-of-distribution detection performance
while keeping the solution seamless. Code available at

training relies on a sizable set of high-quality original datasets. Due to
privacy and security issues, the original datasets are usually unavailable
directly. Recently, federated learning proposes a popular distributed machine
learning paradigm with an enhanced privacy protection mechanism. It offers a
practical and secure framework for data owners to collaborate with others, thus
obtaining a better global model trained on the larger dataset. However, due to
the high complexity of transformer models, the convergence process becomes slow
and unstable in the federated learning setting. Besides, the transformer model
trained in federated learning is costly communication and limited computational
speed on clients, impeding its popularity. To deal with these challenges, we
propose the federated dynamic transformer. On the one hand, the performance is
greatly improved comparing with the federated transformer, approaching
centralize-trained Transformer-TTS when increasing clients number. On the other
hand, it achieves faster and more stable convergence in the training phase and
significantly reduces communication time. Experiments on the LJSpeech dataset
also strongly prove our method's advantage.]]></summary>

deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In practice, the reward shaping-based
approaches are leveraged to provide intrinsic rewards for the agent to
incentivize motivation. However, most existing IRS modules rely on attendant
models or additional memory to record and analyze learning procedures, which
leads to high computational complexity and low robustness. Moreover, they
overemphasize the influence of a single state on exploration, which cannot
evaluate the exploration performance from a global perspective. To tackle the
problem, state entropy-based methods are proposed to encourage the agent to
visit the state space more equitably. However, the estimation error and sample
complexity are prohibitive when handling environments with high-dimensional
observation. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric entitled Jain's
fairness index (JFI) to replace the entropy regularizer, which requires no
additional models or memory. In particular, JFI overcomes the vanishing
intrinsic rewards problem and can be generalized into arbitrary tasks.
Furthermore, we use a variational auto-encoder (VAE) model to capture the
life-long novelty of states. Finally, the global JFI score and local state
novelty are combined to form a multimodal intrinsic reward, controlling the
exploration extent more precisely. Finally, extensive simulation results
demonstrate that our multimodal reward shaping (MMRS) method can achieve higher
performance in contrast to other benchmark schemes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce the \textit{epistemic neural network} (ENN) as an interface for
uncertainty modeling in deep learning. All existing approaches to uncertainty
modeling can be expressed as ENNs, and any ENN can be identified with a
Bayesian neural network. However, this new perspective provides several
promising directions for future research. Where prior work has developed
probabilistic inference tools for neural networks; we ask instead, `which
neural networks are suitable as tools for probabilistic inference?'. We propose
a clear and simple metric for progress in ENNs: the KL-divergence with respect
to a target distribution. We develop a computational testbed based on inference
in a neural network Gaussian process and release our code as a benchmark at
\url{https://github.com/deepmind/enn}. We evaluate several canonical approaches
to uncertainty modeling in deep learning, and find they vary greatly in their
performance. We provide insight to the sensitivity of these results and show
that our metric is highly correlated with performance in sequential decision
problems. Finally, we provide indications that new ENN architectures can
improve performance in both the statistical quality and computational cost.]]></summary>

network(CNN) named Feature Mining, that aims to strengthen the network's
learning of the local feature. Through experiments, we find that semantic
contained in different parts of the feature is different, while the network
will inevitably lose the local information during feedforward propagation. In
order to enhance the learning of local feature, Feature Mining divides the
complete feature into two complementary parts and reuse these divided feature
to make the network learn more local information, we call the two steps as
feature segmentation and feature reusing. Feature Mining is a parameter-free
method and has plug-and-play nature, and can be applied to any CNN models.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the wide applicability, versatility, and

impressive performance improvements on thermal to visible face synthesis and
matching problems. However, current DCNN-based synthesis models do not perform
well on thermal faces with large pose variations. In order to deal with this
problem, heterogeneous face frontalization methods are needed in which a model
takes a thermal profile face image and generates a frontal visible face. This
is an extremely difficult problem due to the large domain as well as large pose
discrepancies between the two modalities. Despite its applications in
biometrics and surveillance, this problem is relatively unexplored in the
literature. We propose a domain agnostic learning-based generative adversarial
network (DAL-GAN) which can synthesize frontal views in the visible domain from
thermal faces with pose variations. DAL-GAN consists of a generator with an
auxiliary classifier and two discriminators which capture both local and global
texture discriminations for better synthesis. A contrastive constraint is
enforced in the latent space of the generator with the help of a dual-path
training strategy, which improves the feature vector discrimination. Finally, a
multi-purpose loss function is utilized to guide the network in synthesizing
identity preserving cross-domain frontalization. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that DAL-GAN can generate better quality frontal views compared to
the other baseline methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated learning is a widely used distributed deep learning framework that
protects the privacy of each client by exchanging model parameters rather than
raw data. However, federated learning suffers from high communication costs, as
a considerable number of model parameters need to be transmitted many times
during the training process, making the approach inefficient, especially when
the communication network bandwidth is limited. This article proposes RingFed,
a novel framework to reduce communication overhead during the training process
of federated learning. Rather than transmitting parameters between the center
server and each client, as in original federated learning, in the proposed
RingFed, the updated parameters are transmitted between each client in turn,
and only the final result is transmitted to the central server, thereby
reducing the communication overhead substantially. After several local updates,
clients first send their parameters to another proximal client, not to the
center server directly, to preaggregate. Experiments on two different public
datasets show that RingFed has fast convergence, high model accuracy, and low
communication cost.]]></summary>

personalized medicine in healthcare. We observed notable challenges in
identifying robust biomarkers as some with great performance in one scenario
often fail to perform well in new trials (e.g. different population,
indications). With rapid development in the clinical trial world (e.g. assay,
disease definition), new trials very likely differ from legacy ones in many
perspectives and in development of biomarkers this heterogeneity should be
considered. In response, we recommend considering building in the heterogeneity
when evaluating biomarkers. In this paper, we present one evaluation strategy
by using leave-one-study-out (LOSO) in place of conventional cross-validation
(cv) methods to account for the potential heterogeneity across trials used for
building and testing the biomarkers. To demonstrate the performance of K-fold
vs LOSO cv in estimating the effect size of biomarkers, we leveraged data from
clinical trials and simulation studies. In our assessment, LOSO cv provided a
more objective estimate of the future performance. This conclusion remained
true across different evaluation metrics and different statistical methods.]]></summary>

literature assume that data are a homogeneous set of observations; whereas it
is often the case that they comprise different related, but not homogeneous,
data sets collected in different ways. In this paper we propose a new Bayesian
Dirichlet score, which we call Bayesian Hierarchical Dirichlet (BHD). The
proposed score is based on a hierarchical model that pools information across
data sets to learn a single encompassing network structure, while taking into
account the differences in their probabilistic structures. We derive a
closed-form expression for BHD using a variational approximation of the
marginal likelihood, we study the associated computational cost and we evaluate
its performance using simulated data. We find that, when data comprise multiple
related data sets, BHD outperforms the Bayesian Dirichlet equivalent uniform
(BDeu) score in terms of reconstruction accuracy as measured by the Structural
Hamming distance, and that it is as accurate as BDeu when data are homogeneous.
This improvement is particularly clear when either the number of variables in
the network or the number of observations is large. Moreover, the estimated
networks are sparser and therefore more interpretable than those obtained with
BDeu thanks to a lower number of false positive arcs.]]></summary>

such as easing traffic congestion in unusual events and evacuating people from
an emergency-affected area. To grab the reins of crowds, there has been
considerable demand for a decision support system that can answer a typical
question: ``what will be the outcomes of each of the possible options in the
current situation. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the
effects of crowd movement guidance from past data. To cope with limited amount
of available data biased by past decision-makers, we leverage two recent
techniques in deep representation learning for spatial data analysis and causal
inference. We use a spatial convolutional operator to extract effective spatial
features of crowds from a small amount of data and use balanced representation
learning based on the integral probability metrics to mitigate the selection
bias and missing counterfactual outcomes. To evaluate the performance on
estimating the treatment effects of possible guidance, we use a multi-agent
simulator to generate realistic data on evacuation scenarios in a crowded
theater, since there are no available datasets recording outcomes of all
possible crowd movement guidance. The results of three experiments demonstrate
that our proposed method reduces the estimation error by at most 56% from
state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

networks, and hypothesis classes with inferior approximation capacity such as
shallow networks or kernel classes. On the other hand, the fact that deep
networks can efficiently express a target function does not mean that this
target function can be learned efficiently by deep neural networks. In this
work we study the intricate connection between learnability and approximation
capacity. We show that learnability with deep networks of a target function
depends on the ability of simpler classes to approximate the target.
Specifically, we show that a necessary condition for a function to be learnable
by gradient descent on deep neural networks is to be able to approximate the
function, at least in a weak sense, with shallow neural networks. We also show
that a class of functions can be learned by an efficient statistical query
algorithm if and only if it can be approximated in a weak sense by some kernel
class. We give several examples of functions which demonstrate depth
separation, and conclude that they cannot be efficiently learned, even by a
hypothesis class that can efficiently approximate them.]]></summary>

usually clustered by first removing incomplete cases or features with missing
values, or by imputing missing values, followed by application of a clustering
algorithm to the resulting altered dataset. Here, we develop clustering
methodology through a model-based approach using the marginal density for the
observed values, assuming a finite mixture model of multivariate $t$
distributions. We compare our approximate algorithm to the corresponding full
expectation-maximization (EM) approach that considers the missing values in the
incomplete data set and makes a missing at random (MAR) assumption, as well as
case deletion and imputation methods. Since only the observed values are
utilized, our approach is computationally more efficient than imputation or
full EM. Simulation studies demonstrate that our approach has favorable
recovery of the true cluster partition compared to case deletion and imputation
under various missingness mechanisms, and is at least competitive with the full
EM approach, even when MAR assumptions are violated. Our methodology is
demonstrated on a problem of clustering gamma-ray bursts and is implemented at

arise in attempts to provide the true class labels for the unclassified data

biometric identification, and has been ubiquitous implemented in
security-critic applications, such as banking and access control. However,
previous works have shown that ASV is under the radar of adversarial attacks,
which are very similar to their original counterparts from human's perception,
yet will manipulate the ASV render wrong prediction. Due to the very late
emergence of adversarial attacks for ASV, effective countermeasures against
them are limited. Given that the security of ASV is of high priority, in this
work, we propose the idea of "voting for the right answer" to prevent risky
decisions of ASV in blind spot areas, by employing random sampling and voting.
Experimental results show that our proposed method improves the robustness
against both the limited-knowledge attackers by pulling the adversarial samples
out of the blind spots, and the perfect-knowledge attackers by introducing
randomness and increasing the attackers' budgets.]]></summary>

neural networks (GNNs) use neighborhood aggregation as a core component that
results in feature smoothing among nodes in proximity. While successful in
various prediction tasks, such a paradigm falls short of capturing nodes'
similarities over a long distance, which proves to be important for
high-quality learning. To tackle this problem, we strengthen the graph with two
additional graph views, in which nodes are directly linked to those with the
most similar features or local structures. Not restricted by connectivity in
the original graph, the generated views allow the model to enhance its
expressive power with new and complementary perspectives from which to look at
the relationship between nodes. Following a contrastive learning approach, we
propose a method that aims to maximize the agreement between representations
across generated views and the original graph. We also propose a channel-level
contrast approach that greatly reduces computation cost, compared to the
commonly used node level contrast, which requires computation cost quadratic in
the number of nodes. Extensive experiments on seven assortative graphs and four

generation for their potential ability to produce reasonable predictable energy
without the emission of greenhouse gases. Once the main forcing components for
driving the tides have deterministic dynamics, the available energy in a given
tidal power plant has been estimated, through analytical and numerical
optimisation routines, as a mostly predictable event. This constraint imposes
state-of-art flexible operation methods to rely on tidal predictions
(concurrent with measured data and up to a multiple of half-tidal cycles into
the future) to infer best operational strategies for tidal lagoons, with the
additional cost of requiring to run optimisation routines for every new tide.
In this paper, we propose a novel optimised operation of tidal lagoons with
proximal policy optimisation through Unity ML-Agents. We compare this technique
with 6 different operation optimisation approaches (baselines) devised from the
literature, utilising the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon as a case study. We show
that our approach is successful in maximising energy generation through an
optimised operational policy of turbines and sluices, yielding competitive
results with state-of-the-art methods of optimisation, regardless of test data
used, requiring training once and performing real-time flexible control with

which determines the distribution of samples. In this setting, Minimum Excess
Risk (MER) is defined as the difference between the minimum expected loss
achievable when learning from data and the minimum expected loss that could be
achieved if $W$ was observed. In this paper, we build upon and extend the
recent results of (Xu & Raginsky, 2020) to analyze the MER in Bayesian learning
and derive information-theoretic bounds on it. We formulate the problem as a
(constrained) rate-distortion optimization and show how the solution can be
bounded above and below by two other rate-distortion functions that are easier
to study. The lower bound represents the minimum possible excess risk
achievable by any process using $R$ bits of information from the parameter $W$.
For the upper bound, the optimization is further constrained to use $R$ bits
from the training set, a setting which relates MER to information-theoretic
bounds on the generalization gap in frequentist learning. We derive
information-theoretic bounds on the difference between these upper and lower
bounds and show that they can provide order-wise tight rates for MER under
certain conditions. This analysis gives more insight into the
information-theoretic nature of Bayesian learning as well as providing novel
bounds.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motivation: Computational models that accurately identify high-affinity
protein-compound pairs can accelerate drug discovery pipelines. These models
aim to learn binding mechanics through drug-target interaction datasets and use
the learned knowledge for predicting the affinity of an input protein-compound
pair. However, the datasets they rely on bear misleading patterns that bias
models towards memorizing dataset-specific biomolecule properties, instead of
learning binding mechanics. This results in models that struggle while
predicting drug-target affinities (DTA), especially between de novo
biomolecules. Here we present DebiasedDTA, the first DTA model debiasing
approach that avoids dataset biases in order to boost affinity prediction for
novel biomolecules. DebiasedDTA uses ensemble learning and sample weight
adaptation for bias identification and avoidance and is applicable to almost
all existing DTA prediction models. Results: The results show that DebiasedDTA
can boost models while predicting the interactions between novel biomolecules.
Known biomolecules also benefit from the performance improvement, especially
when the test biomolecules are dissimilar to the training set. The experiments
also show that DebiasedDTA can augment DTA prediction models of different input
and model structures and is able to avoid biases of different sources.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background and objective: In this paper, a modified U-Net based framework is
presented, which leverages techniques from Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block,
Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and residual learning for accurate and
robust liver CT segmentation, and the effectiveness of the proposed method was
tested on two public datasets LiTS17 and SLiver07.

Methods: A new network architecture called SAR-U-Net was designed. Firstly,
the SE block is introduced to adaptively extract image features after each
convolution in the U-Net encoder, while suppressing irrelevant regions, and
highlighting features of specific segmentation task; Secondly, ASPP was
employed to replace the transition layer and the output layer, and acquire
multi-scale image information via different receptive fields. Thirdly, to
alleviate the degradation problem, the traditional convolution block was
replaced with the residual block and thus prompt the network to gain accuracy
from considerably increased depth.

Results: In the LiTS17 experiment, the mean values of Dice, VOE, RVD, ASD and
MSD were 95.71, 9.52, -0.84, 1.54 and 29.14, respectively. Compared with other
closely related 2D-based models, the proposed method achieved the highest
accuracy. In the experiment of the SLiver07, the mean values of Dice, VOE, RVD,
ASD and MSD were 97.31, 5.37, -1.08, 1.85 and 27.45, respectively. Compared
with other closely related models, the proposed method achieved the highest
segmentation accuracy except for the RVD.

Conclusion: The proposed model enables a great improvement on the accuracy
compared to 2D-based models, and its robustness in circumvent challenging
problems, such as small liver regions, discontinuous liver regions, and fuzzy
liver boundaries, is also well demonstrated and validated.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In deep learning with differential privacy (DP), the neural network achieves
the privacy usually at the cost of slower convergence (and thus lower
performance) than its non-private counterpart. This work gives the first
convergence analysis of the DP deep learning, through the lens of training
dynamics and the neural tangent kernel (NTK). Our convergence theory
successfully characterizes the effects of two key components in the DP
training: the per-sample clipping (flat or layerwise) and the noise addition.
Our analysis not only initiates a general principled framework to understand
the DP deep learning with any network architecture and loss function, but also
motivates a new clipping method -- the global clipping, that significantly
improves the convergence while preserving the same privacy guarantee as the
existing local clipping.

In terms of theoretical results, we establish the precise connection between
the per-sample clipping and NTK matrix. We show that in the gradient flow,
i.e., with infinitesimal learning rate, the noise level of DP optimizers does
not affect the convergence. We prove that DP gradient descent (GD) with global
clipping guarantees the monotone convergence to zero loss, which can be
violated by the existing DP-GD with local clipping. Notably, our analysis
framework easily extends to other optimizers, e.g., DP-Adam. Empirically
speaking, DP optimizers equipped with global clipping perform strongly on a
wide range of classification and regression tasks. In particular, our global
clipping is surprisingly effective at learning calibrated classifiers, in
contrast to the existing DP classifiers which are oftentimes over-confident and
unreliable. Implementation-wise, the new clipping can be realized by adding one
line of code into the Opacus library.]]></summary>

the future to maintain stable and economic power system operation. To tackle
this challenge, a deep neural network-based voltage-constrained approach
(DeepOPF-V) is proposed to solve AC-OPF problems with high computational
efficiency. Its unique design predicts voltages of all buses and then uses them
to reconstruct the remaining variables without solving non-linear AC power flow
equations. A fast post-processing process is developed to enforce the box
constraints. The effectiveness of DeepOPF-V is validated by simulations on IEEE
118/300-bus systems and a 2000-bus test system. Compared with existing studies,
DeepOPF-V achieves decent computation speedup up to four orders of magnitude
and comparable performance in optimality gap and preserving the feasibility of

finding a feasible solution for (mixed) integer programming (MIP) problems.
Finding a feasible solution for MIP problems is critical because many
successful heuristics rely on a known initial feasible solution. However, it is
in general NP-hard. Inspired by the feasibility pump (FP), a well-known
heuristic for searching feasible MIP solutions, we develop a smart feasibility
pump (SFP) method using DRL. In addition to multi-layer perception (MLP), we
propose a novel convolution neural network (CNN) structure for the policy
network to capture the hidden information of the constraint matrix of the MIP
problem. Numerical experiments on various problem instances show that SFP
significantly outperforms the classic FP in terms of the number of steps
required to reach the first feasible solution. Moreover, the CNN structure
works without the projection of the current solution as the input, which saves
the computational effort at each step of the FP algorithms to find projections.
This highlights the representational power of the CNN structure.]]></summary>

robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. However, existing methods assume
that training and testing data are from the same domain, which suffers from
severe performance degradation when a domain gap exists, such as the simulator
and real robot. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised domain
adaptation framework which can simultaneously transfer multi-modality
knowledge, i.e., both kinematic and visual data, from simulator to real robot.
It remedies the domain gap with enhanced transferable features by using
temporal cues in videos, and inherent correlations in multi-modal towards
recognizing gesture. Specifically, we first propose an MDO-K to align
kinematics, which exploits temporal continuity to transfer motion directions
with smaller gap rather than position values, relieving the adaptation burden.
Moreover, we propose a KV-Relation-ATT to transfer the co-occurrence signals of
kinematics and vision. Such features attended by correlation similarity are
more informative for enhancing domain-invariance of the model. Two feature
alignment strategies benefit the model mutually during the end-to-end learning
process. We extensively evaluate our method for gesture recognition using DESK
dataset with peg transfer procedure. Results show that our approach recovers
the performance with great improvement gains, up to 12.91% in ACC and 20.16% in

protein interaction networks lack such contextualization, thereby limiting the
study of where protein interactions likely occur in the human body and how they

reflects network topology at a single-cell resolution. We construct a

cell type, and tissue embeddings that uphold cell type and tissue hierarchies.
We demonstrate AWARE's utility on the novel task of predicting whether a
protein is altered in disease and where that association most likely manifests
in the human body. To this end, AWARE outperforms generic embeddings without
contextual information by at least 12.5%, showing AWARE's potential to reveal

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper concentrates on the approximation power of deep feed-forward
neural networks in terms of width and depth. It is proved by construction that
ReLU networks with width $\mathcal{O}\big(\max\{d\lfloor N^{1/d}\rfloor,\,
N+2\}\big)$ and depth $\mathcal{O}(L)$ can approximate a H\"older continuous
function on $[0,1]^d$ with an approximation rate
$\mathcal{O}\big(\lambda\sqrt{d} (N^2L^2\ln N)^{-\alpha/d}\big)$, where
$\alpha\in (0,1]$ and $\lambda>0$ are H\"older order and constant,
respectively. Such a rate is optimal up to a constant in terms of width and
depth separately, while existing results are only nearly optimal without the
logarithmic factor in the approximation rate. More generally, for an arbitrary
continuous function $f$ on $[0,1]^d$, the approximation rate becomes
$\mathcal{O}\big(\,\sqrt{d}\,\omega_f\big( (N^2L^2\ln N)^{-1/d}\big)\,\big)$,
where $\omega_f(\cdot)$ is the modulus of continuity. We also extend our
analysis to any continuous function $f$ on a bounded set. Particularly, if ReLU
networks with depth $31$ and width $\mathcal{O}(N)$ are used to approximate
one-dimensional Lipschitz continuous functions on $[0,1]$ with a Lipschitz
constant $\lambda>0$, the approximation rate in terms of the total number of
parameters, $W=\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, becomes $\mathcal{O}(\tfrac{\lambda}{W\ln
W})$, which has not been discovered in the literature for fixed-depth ReLU
networks.]]></summary>

humans yet challenging for machines to reproduce. This is because most learning

aims to achieve OOD generalization by using only source data for model
learning. Since first introduced in 2011, research in DG has made great
progresses. In particular, intensive research in this topic has led to a broad
spectrum of methodologies, e.g., those based on domain alignment,
meta-learning, data augmentation, or ensemble learning, just to name a few; and
has covered various vision applications such as object recognition,
segmentation, action recognition, and person re-identification. In this paper,
for the first time a comprehensive literature review is provided to summarize
the developments in DG for computer vision over the past decade. Specifically,
we first cover the background by formally defining DG and relating it to other
research fields like domain adaptation and transfer learning. Second, we

the Shattering coefficient function $\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{F},n)$ to upper bound
the empirical risk minimization principle, from which one can estimate the

equivalence relations from Topology, data separability results by Har-Peled and

worst and best-case classification scenarios and the respective $\Omega$ and
$O$ complexities; (ii) the estimation of the training sample sizes required to

summary of disease-related information about patients. Such coding is usually
done manually in hospitals but could potentially be automated to improve the
efficiency and accuracy of medical coding. Recent studies on deep learning for
automated medical coding achieved promising performances. However, the
explainability of these models is usually poor, preventing them to be used
confidently in supporting clinical practice. Another limitation is that these
models mostly assume independence among labels, ignoring the complex
correlation among medical codes which can potentially be exploited to improve
the performance. We propose a Hierarchical Label-wise Attention Network (HLAN),
which aimed to interpret the model by quantifying importance (as attention
weights) of words and sentences related to each of the labels. Secondly, we
propose to enhance the major deep learning models with a label embedding (LE)
initialisation approach, which learns a dense, continuous vector representation
and then injects the representation into the final layers and the label-wise
attention layers in the models. We evaluated the methods using three settings
on the MIMIC-III discharge summaries: full codes, top-50 codes, and the UK NHS
COVID-19 shielding codes. Experiments were conducted to compare HLAN and LE
initialisation to the state-of-the-art neural network based methods. HLAN
achieved the best Micro-level AUC and $F_1$ on the top-50 code prediction and
comparable results on the NHS COVID-19 shielding code prediction to other
models. By highlighting the most salient words and sentences for each label,
HLAN showed more meaningful and comprehensive model interpretation compared to
its downgraded baselines and the CNN-based models. LE initialisation
consistently boosted most deep learning models for automated medical coding.]]></summary>

generalization. In general, model training harnesses information contained in
the sample-sample second moment matrix of a dataset. For a general class of
models, namely models with a fully connected first layer, we prove that the
information contained in this matrix is the only information which can be used
to generalize. Models trained using whitened data, or with certain second order
optimization schemes, have less access to this information, resulting in
reduced or nonexistent generalization ability. We experimentally verify these
predictions for several architectures, and further demonstrate that
generalization continues to be harmed even when theoretical requirements are
relaxed. However, we also show experimentally that regularized second order
optimization can provide a practical tradeoff, where training is accelerated
but less information is lost, and generalization can in some circumstances even
improve.]]></summary>

discover possible interactions and autonomously build repertoires of skills is
a general objective of artificial intelligence. Developmental approaches argue
that this can only be achieved by autonomous and intrinsically motivated
learning agents that can generate, select and learn to solve their own
problems. In recent years, we have seen a convergence of developmental
approaches, and developmental robotics in particular, with deep reinforcement
learning (RL) methods, forming the new domain of developmental machine
learning. Within this new domain, we review here a set of methods where deep RL
algorithms are trained to tackle the developmental robotics problem of the
autonomous acquisition of open-ended repertoires of skills. Intrinsically
motivated goal-conditioned RL algorithms train agents to learn to represent,
generate and pursue their own goals. The self-generation of goals requires the
learning of compact goal encodings as well as their associated goal-achievement
functions, which results in new challenges compared to traditional RL
algorithms designed to tackle pre-defined sets of goals using external reward
signals. This paper proposes a typology of these methods at the intersection of
deep RL and developmental approaches, surveys recent approaches and discusses
future avenues.]]></summary>

with neural networks as a differentiable layer. In contrast to other
differentiable physics approaches that use explicit forward models to define
state transitions, we focus on implicit state transitions defined via function
minimization. Implicit state transitions appear in implicit numerical
integration methods, which offer the benefits of large time steps and excellent
numerical stability, but require a special treatment to achieve
differentiability due to the absence of an explicit differentiable forward
pass. In contrast to other implicit differentiation approaches that require
explicit formulas for the force function and the force Jacobian matrix, we
present an energy-based approach that allows us to compute these derivatives
automatically and in a matrix-free fashion via reverse-mode automatic
differentiation. This allows for more flexibility and productivity when
defining physical models and is particularly important in the context of neural
network training, which often relies on reverse-mode automatic differentiation
(backpropagation). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our differentiable
simulator in policy optimization for locomotion tasks and show that it achieves
better sample efficiency than model-free reinforcement learning.]]></summary>

remarkable success due to their class-wise controllability and superior quality
for complex generation tasks. Typical cGANs solve the joint distribution
matching problem by decomposing two easier sub-problems: marginal matching and
conditional matching. From our toy experiments, we found that it is the best to
apply only conditional matching to certain samples due to the content-aware
optimization of the discriminator. This paper proposes a simple (a few lines of
code) but effective training methodology, selective focusing learning, which
enforces the discriminator and generator to learn easy samples of each class
rapidly while maintaining diversity. Our key idea is to selectively apply
conditional and joint matching for the data in each mini-batch. We conducted
experiments on recent cGAN variants in ImageNet (64x64 and 128x128), CIFAR-10,
and CIFAR-100 datasets, and improved the performance significantly (up to
35.18% in terms of FID) without sacrificing diversity.]]></summary>

vision, which brings new challenges such as small object inference, background
clutter and wide viewpoint. However, there are few algorithms focusing on crowd
counting on the drone-captured data due to the lack of comprehensive datasets.
To this end, we collect a large-scale dataset and organize the Vision Meets
Drone Crowd Counting Challenge (VisDrone-CC2020) in conjunction with the 16th
European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV 2020) to promote the developments
in the related fields. The collected dataset is formed by $3,360$ images,
including $2,460$ images for training, and $900$ images for testing.
Specifically, we manually annotate persons with points in each video frame.
There are $14$ algorithms from $15$ institutes submitted to the VisDrone-CC2020
Challenge. We provide a detailed analysis of the evaluation results and
conclude the challenge. More information can be found at the website:

images for detecting skin defects and abnormalities. However, current deep
learning solutions for dermatological lesion analysis are typically limited in
providing probabilistic predictions which highlights the importance of
concerning uncertainties. This concept of uncertainty can provide a confidence
level for each feature which prevents overconfident predictions with poor
generalization on unseen data. In this paper, we propose an overall framework
that jointly considers dermatological classification and uncertainty estimation
together. The estimated confidence of each feature to avoid uncertain feature
and undesirable shift, which are caused by environmental difference of input
image, in the latent space is pooled from confidence network. Our qualitative
results show that modeling uncertainties not only helps to quantify model
confidence for each prediction but also helps classification layers to focus on
confident features, therefore, improving the accuracy for dermatological lesion
classification. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach in two
state-of-the-art dermoscopic datasets (ISIC 2018 and ISIC 2019).]]></summary>

for its predictions, is expected to accelerate the use of deep neural networks
in the real world like Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) that returns
predictions on queried data with the trained model. Deep neural networks
deployed in MLaaS face the threat of model extraction attacks. A model
extraction attack is an attack to violate intellectual property and privacy in
which an adversary steals trained models in a cloud using only their
predictions. In particular, a data-free model extraction attack has been
proposed recently and is more critical. In this attack, an adversary uses a
generative model instead of preparing input data. The feasibility of this
attack, however, needs to be studied since it requires more queries than that
with surrogate datasets. In this paper, we propose MEGEX, a data-free model
extraction attack against a gradient-based explainable AI. In this method, an
adversary uses the explanations to train the generative model and reduces the
number of queries to steal the model. Our experiments show that our proposed
method reconstructs high-accuracy models -- 0.97$\times$ and 0.98$\times$ the
victim model accuracy on SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets given 2M and 20M queries,
respectively. This implies that there is a trade-off between the
interpretability of models and the difficulty of stealing them.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When controllers (brains) and morphologies (bodies) of robots simultaneously
evolve, this can lead to a problem, namely the brain & body mismatch problem.
In this research, we propose a solution of lifetime learning. We set up a
system where modular robots can create offspring that inherit the bodies of
parents by recombination and mutation. With regards to the brains of the
offspring, we use two methods to create them. The first one entails solely
evolution which means the brain of a robot child is inherited from its parents.
The second approach is evolution plus learning which means the brain of a child
is inherited as well, but additionally is developed by a learning algorithm -
RevDEknn. We compare these two methods by running experiments in a simulator
called Revolve and use efficiency, efficacy, and the morphology intelligence of
the robots for the comparison. The experiments show that the evolution plus
learning method does not only lead to a higher fitness level, but also to more
morphologically evolving robots. This constitutes a quantitative demonstration
that changes in the brain can induce changes in the body, leading to the
concept of morphological intelligence, which is quantified by the learning
delta, meaning the ability of a morphology to facilitate learning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although deep learning has demonstrated astonishing performance in many
applications, there are still concerns on their dependability. One desirable
property of deep learning applications with societal impact is fairness (i.e.,
non-discrimination). Unfortunately, discrimination might be intrinsically
embedded into the models due to discrimination in the training data. As a
countermeasure, fairness testing systemically identifies discriminative
samples, which can be used to retrain the model and improve its fairness.
Existing fairness testing approaches however have two major limitations. First,
they only work well on traditional machine learning models and have poor
performance (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency) on deep learning models.
Second, they only work on simple tabular data and are not applicable for
domains such as text. In this work, we bridge the gap by proposing a scalable
and effective approach for systematically searching for discriminative samples
while extending fairness testing to address a challenging domain, i.e., text
classification. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach only
employs lightweight procedures like gradient computation and clustering, which
makes it significantly more scalable. Experimental results show that on
average, our approach explores the search space more effectively (9.62 and 2.38
times more than the state-of-art methods respectively on tabular and text
datasets) and generates much more individual discriminatory instances (24.95
and 2.68 times) within reasonable time. The retrained models reduce
discrimination by 57.2% and 60.2% respectively on average.]]></summary>

underlying latent factors of variation as well as the mechanism through which
each factor acts in the world. In this paper, we test whether 17 unsupervised,
weakly supervised, and fully supervised representation learning approaches
correctly infer the generative factors of variation in simple datasets
(dSprites, Shapes3D, MPI3D). In contrast to prior robustness work that
introduces novel factors of variation during test time, such as blur or other
(un)structured noise, we here recompose, interpolate, or extrapolate only
existing factors of variation from the training data set (e.g., small and
medium-sized objects during training and large objects during testing). Models
that learn the correct mechanism should be able to generalize to this
benchmark. In total, we train and test 2000+ models and observe that all of
them struggle to learn the underlying mechanism regardless of supervision
signal and architectural bias. Moreover, the generalization capabilities of all
tested models drop significantly as we move from artificial datasets towards
more realistic real-world datasets. Despite their inability to identify the
correct mechanism, the models are quite modular as their ability to infer other
in-distribution factors remains fairly stable, providing only a single factor
is out-of-distribution. These results point to an important yet understudied
problem of learning mechanistic models of observations that can facilitate

optimization that are based on an analogy to non-smooth dynamical systems. Two
distinctive features of our approach are that (i) projections or optimizations
over the entire feasible set are avoided, in stark contrast to projected
gradient methods or the Frank-Wolfe method, and (ii) iterates are allowed to
become infeasible, which differs from active set or feasible direction methods,
where the descent motion stops as soon as a new constraint is encountered. The
resulting algorithmic procedure is simple to implement even when constraints
are nonlinear, and is suitable for large-scale constrained optimization
problems in which the feasible set fails to have a simple structure. The key
underlying idea is that constraints are expressed in terms of velocities
instead of positions, which has the algorithmic consequence that optimizations
over feasible sets at each iteration are replaced with optimizations over
local, sparse convex approximations. The result is a simplified suite of
algorithms and an expanded range of possible applications in machine learning.]]></summary>

edge to collaboratively train a shared machine learning model, while keeping
all the raw training samples on device. This decentralized training approach is
demonstrated as a practical solution to mitigate the risk of privacy leakage.
However, enabling efficient FL deployment at the edge is challenging because of
non-IID training data distribution, wide system heterogeneity and
stochastic-varying runtime effects in the field. This paper jointly optimizes
time-to-convergence and energy efficiency of state-of-the-art FL use cases by
taking into account the stochastic nature of edge execution. We propose AutoFL
by tailor-designing a reinforcement learning algorithm that learns and
determines which K participant devices and per-device execution targets for
each FL model aggregation round in the presence of stochastic runtime variance,
system and data heterogeneity. By considering the unique characteristics of FL
edge deployment judiciously, AutoFL achieves 3.6 times faster model convergence
time and 4.7 and 5.2 times higher energy efficiency for local clients and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Machine learning has recently demonstrated impressive progress in predictive
accuracy across a wide array of tasks. Most ML approaches focus on
generalization performance on unseen data that are similar to the training data
(In-Distribution, or IND). However, real world applications and deployments of
ML rarely enjoy the comfort of encountering examples that are always IND. In
such situations, most ML models commonly display erratic behavior on
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) examples, such as assigning high confidence to wrong
predictions, or vice-versa. Implications of such unusual model behavior are
further exacerbated in the healthcare setting, where patient health can
potentially be put at risk. It is crucial to study the behavior and robustness
properties of models under distributional shift, understand common failure
modes, and take mitigation steps before the model is deployed. Having a
benchmark that shines light upon these aspects of a model is a first and
necessary step in addressing the issue. Recent work and interest in increasing
model robustness in OOD settings have focused more on image modality, while the
Electronic Health Record (EHR) modality is still largely under-explored. We aim
to bridge this gap by releasing BEDS-Bench, a benchmark for quantifying the
behavior of ML models over EHR data under OOD settings. We use two open access,
de-identified EHR datasets to construct several OOD data settings to run tests
on, and measure relevant metrics that characterize crucial aspects of a model's
OOD behavior. We evaluate several learning algorithms under BEDS-Bench and find
that all of them show poor generalization performance under distributional
shift in general. Our results highlight the need and the potential to improve
robustness of EHR models under distributional shift, and BEDS-Bench provides
one way to measure progress towards that goal.]]></summary>

a pervasive technology adopted in almost every aspect of computing. ML-powered
products are now embedded in our digital lives: from recommendations of what to
watch, to divining our search intent, to powering virtual assistants in
consumer and enterprise settings. Recent successes in applying ML in natural
sciences revealed that ML can be used to tackle some of the hardest real-world
problems humanity faces today. For these reasons ML has become central in the
strategy of tech companies and has gathered even more attention from academia
than ever before. Despite these successes, what we have witnessed so far is
just the beginning. Right now the people training and using ML models are
expert developers working within large organizations, but we believe the next
wave of ML systems will allow a larger amount of people, potentially without
coding skills, to perform the same tasks. These new ML systems will not require
users to fully understand all the details of how models are trained and
utilized for obtaining predictions. Declarative interfaces are well suited for
this goal, by hiding complexity and favouring separation of interests, and can
lead to increased productivity. We worked on such abstract interfaces by
developing two declarative ML systems, Overton and Ludwig, that require users
to declare only their data schema (names and types of inputs) and tasks rather
then writing low level ML code. In this article we will describe how ML systems
are currently structured, highlight important factors for their success and
adoption, what are the issues current ML systems are facing and how the systems
we developed addressed them. Finally we will talk about learnings from the
development of ML systems throughout the years and how we believe the next
generation of ML systems will look like.]]></summary>

collaboratively build a learning model iteratively through interactions with a
server from whom we need privacy. Motivated by stochastic optimization and the
federated learning (FL) paradigm, we focus on the case where a small fraction
of data samples are randomly sub-sampled in each round to participate in the
learning process, which also enables privacy amplification. To obtain even
stronger local privacy guarantees, we study this in the shuffle privacy model,
where each client randomizes its response using a local differentially private
(LDP) mechanism and the server only receives a random permutation (shuffle) of
the clients' responses without their association to each client. The principal
result of this paper is a privacy-optimization performance trade-off for
discrete randomization mechanisms in this sub-sampled shuffle privacy model.
This is enabled through a new theoretical technique to analyze the Renyi
Differential Privacy (RDP) of the sub-sampled shuffle model. We numerically
demonstrate that, for important regimes, with composition our bound yields
significant improvement in privacy guarantee over the state-of-the-art
approximate Differential Privacy (DP) guarantee (with strong composition) for
sub-sampled shuffled models. We also demonstrate numerically significant
improvement in privacy-learning performance operating point using real data

doing so suffers from the intractability of inference. As a step towards
tractable causal models, we consider the problem of learning interventional

gate functions, e.g., neural networks. Providing an arbitrarily intervened
causal graph as input, effectively subsuming Pearl's do-operator, the gate
function predicts the parameters of the SPN. The resulting interventional SPNs
are motivated and illustrated by a structural causal model themed around
personal health. Our empirical evaluation on three benchmark data sets as well

indeed are both expressive in modelling and flexible in adapting to the

Bayesian machine learning applications. Often, this requires to meaningfully
attribute predictive uncertainties to source features in an image, text or
categorical array. However, popular attribution methods are particularly
designed for classification and regression scores. In order to explain
uncertainties, state of the art alternatives commonly procure counterfactual
feature vectors, and proceed by making direct comparisons. In this paper, we
leverage path integrals to attribute uncertainties in Bayesian differentiable
models. We present a novel algorithm that relies on in-distribution curves
connecting a feature vector to some counterfactual counterpart, and we retain
desirable properties of interpretability methods. We validate our approach on
benchmark image data sets with varying resolution, and show that it
significantly simplifies interpretability over the existing alternatives.]]></summary>

and aims to measure the strength of the causal relationship, is of great
importance in many fields but is a challenging problem in practice. As present,
data-driven causal effect estimation faces two main challenges, i.e., selection
bias and the missing of counterfactual. To address these two issues, most of
the existing approaches tend to reduce the selection bias by learning a
balanced representation, and then to estimate the counterfactual through the
representation. However, they heavily rely on the finely hand-crafted metric
functions when learning balanced representations, which generally doesn't work
well for the situations where the original distribution is complicated. In this
paper, we propose a CETransformer model for casual effect estimation via
transformer based representation learning. To learn the representation of
covariates(features) robustly, a self-supervised transformer is proposed, by
which the correlation between covariates can be well exploited through
self-attention mechanism. In addition, an adversarial network is adopted to
balance the distribution of the treated and control groups in the
representation space. Experimental results on three real-world datasets
demonstrate the advantages of the proposed CETransformer, compared with the
state-of-the-art treatment effect estimation methods.]]></summary>

representation of graph-structured data. Recent work demonstrates that
transferring knowledge from self-supervised tasks to downstream tasks could
further improve graph representation. However, there is an inherent gap between
self-supervised tasks and downstream tasks in terms of optimization objective
and training data. Conventional pre-training methods may be not effective
enough on knowledge transfer since they do not make any adaptation for
downstream tasks. To solve such problems, we propose a new transfer learning
paradigm on GNNs which could effectively leverage self-supervised tasks as
auxiliary tasks to help the target task. Our methods would adaptively select
and combine different auxiliary tasks with the target task in the fine-tuning
stage. We design an adaptive auxiliary loss weighting model to learn the
weights of auxiliary tasks by quantifying the consistency between auxiliary
tasks and the target task. In addition, we learn the weighting model through
meta-learning. Our methods can be applied to various transfer learning
approaches, it performs well not only in multi-task learning but also in
pre-training and fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on multiple downstream
tasks demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively combine auxiliary

reduce the message enrichment explosion. Extensive experiments demonstrated
that the proposed model obtained superior performances (around 4$\%$ on

Wafer map pattern classification is a typical way of quality assurance. The
defect pattern on the wafer map can tell us which process has a problem. Most

methods. The supervised methods tend to have high performance, but they require
extensive labor and expert knowledge to produce labeled datasets with a

iteration, remains a major impediment for learning behaviors through deep
reinforcement learning. In contrast, providing visual demonstrations of desired
behaviors often presents an easier and more natural way to teach agents. We
consider a setting where an agent is provided a fixed dataset of visual
demonstrations illustrating how to perform a task, and must learn to solve the
task using the provided demonstrations and unsupervised environment
interactions. This setting presents a number of challenges including
representation learning for visual observations, sample complexity due to high
dimensional spaces, and learning instability due to the lack of a fixed reward
or learning signal. Towards addressing these challenges, we develop a
variational model-based adversarial imitation learning (V-MAIL) algorithm. The
model-based approach provides a strong signal for representation learning,
enables sample efficiency, and improves the stability of adversarial training
by enabling on-policy learning. Through experiments involving several
vision-based locomotion and manipulation tasks, we find that V-MAIL learns
successful visuomotor policies in a sample-efficient manner, has better
stability compared to prior work, and also achieves higher asymptotic
performance. We further find that by transferring the learned models, V-MAIL
can learn new tasks from visual demonstrations without any additional

representation of graph-structured data and achieved better task performance
than conventional methods. The foundation of GNNs is the message passing
procedure, which propagates the information in a node to its neighbors. Since
this procedure proceeds one step per layer, the range of the information
propagation among nodes is small in the lower layers, and it expands toward the
higher layers. Therefore, a GNN model has to be deep enough to capture global
structural information in a graph. On the other hand, it is known that deep GNN
models suffer from performance degradation because they lose nodes' local
information, which would be essential for good model performance, through many
message passing steps. In this study, we propose a multi-level attention
pooling (MLAP) for graph-level classification tasks, which can adapt to both
local and global structural information in a graph. It has an attention pooling
layer for each message passing step and computes the final graph representation
by unifying the layer-wise graph representations. The MLAP architecture allows
models to utilize the structural information of graphs with multiple levels of
localities because it preserves layer-wise information before losing them due
to oversmoothing. Results of our experiments show that the MLAP architecture
improves deeper models' performance in graph classification tasks compared to
the baseline architectures. In addition, analyses on the layer-wise graph
representations suggest that aggregating information from multiple levels of
localities indeed has the potential to improve the discriminability of learned
graph representations.]]></summary>

years. Highly complex sequential decision making problems from game playing and
robotics have been solved with deep model-free methods. Unfortunately, the
sample complexity of model-free methods is often high. To reduce the number of
environment samples, model-based reinforcement learning creates an explicit
model of the environment dynamics. Achieving high model accuracy is a challenge
in high-dimensional problems. In recent years, a diverse landscape of
model-based methods has been introduced to improve model accuracy, using
methods such as uncertainty modeling, model-predictive control, latent models,
and end-to-end learning and planning. Some of these methods succeed in
achieving high accuracy at low sample complexity, most do so either in a
robotics or in a games context. In this paper, we survey these methods; we
explain in detail how they work and what their strengths and weaknesses are. We
conclude with a research agenda for future work to make the methods more robust
and more widely applicable to other applications.]]></summary>

theory to (a) confront the designer with a normative question about what the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Transformer architecture is widely used for machine translation tasks.
However, its resource-intensive nature makes it challenging to implement on
constrained embedded devices, particularly where available hardware resources
can vary at run-time. We propose a dynamic machine translation model that
scales the Transformer architecture based on the available resources at any
particular time. The proposed approach, 'Dynamic-HAT', uses a HAT
SuperTransformer as the backbone to search for SubTransformers with different
accuracy-latency trade-offs at design time. The optimal SubTransformers are
sampled from the SuperTransformer at run-time, depending on latency
constraints. The Dynamic-HAT is tested on the Jetson Nano and the approach uses
inherited SubTransformers sampled directly from the SuperTransformer with a
switching time of <1s. Using inherited SubTransformers results in a BLEU score
loss of <1.5% because the SubTransformer configuration is not retrained from
scratch after sampling. However, to recover this loss in performance, the
dimensions of the design space can be reduced to tailor it to a family of
target hardware. The new reduced design space results in a BLEU score increase
of approximately 1% for sub-optimal models from the original design space, with
a wide range for performance scaling between 0.356s - 1.526s for the GPU and
2.9s - 7.31s for the CPU.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nowadays fairness issues have raised great concerns in decision-making
systems. Various fairness notions have been proposed to measure the degree to
which an algorithm is unfair. In practice, there frequently exist a certain set
of variables we term as fair variables, which are pre-decision covariates such
as users' choices. The effects of fair variables are irrelevant in assessing
the fairness of the decision support algorithm. We thus define conditional
fairness as a more sound fairness metric by conditioning on the fairness
variables. Given different prior knowledge of fair variables, we demonstrate
that traditional fairness notations, such as demographic parity and equalized
odds, are special cases of our conditional fairness notations. Moreover, we
propose a Derivable Conditional Fairness Regularizer (DCFR), which can be
integrated into any decision-making model, to track the trade-off between
precision and fairness of algorithmic decision making. Specifically, an
adversarial representation based conditional independence loss is proposed in
our DCFR to measure the degree of unfairness. With extensive experiments on
three real-world datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of our conditional
fairness notation and DCFR.]]></summary>

However, this framework has two main drawbacks: (i) Wasserstein-1 (or
Earth-Mover) distance is restrictive such that WGANs cannot always fit data
geometry well; (ii) It is difficult to achieve fast training of WGANs. In this
paper, we propose a new class of \textit{Relaxed Wasserstein} (RW) distances by
generalizing Wasserstein-1 distance with Bregman cost functions. We show that
RW distances achieve nice statistical properties while not sacrificing the
computational tractability. Combined with the GANs framework, we develop
Relaxed WGANs (RWGANs) which are not only statistically flexible but can be
approximated efficiently using heuristic approaches. Experiments on real images
demonstrate that the RWGAN with Kullback-Leibler (KL) cost function outperforms
other competing approaches, e.g., WGANs, even with gradient penalty.]]></summary>

damages, and uprooting communities, ecosystems and economies. Accurate and
robust flood detection including delineating open water flood areas and
identifying flood levels can aid in disaster response and mitigation. However,
estimating flood levels remotely is of essence as physical access to flooded
areas is limited and the ability to deploy instruments in potential flood zones
can be dangerous. Aligning flood extent mapping with local topography can
provide a plan-of-action that the disaster response team can consider. Thus,
remote flood level estimation via satellites like Sentinel-1 can prove to be
remedial. The Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence (ETCI)
competition on Flood Detection tasked participants with predicting flooded
pixels after training with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images in a
supervised setting. We use a cyclical approach involving two stages (1)
training an ensemble model of multiple UNet architectures with available high
and low confidence labeled data and, (2) generating pseudo labels or low
confidence labels on the unlabeled test dataset, and then, combining the
generated labels with the previously available high confidence labeled dataset.
This assimilated dataset is used for the next round of training ensemble
models. This cyclical process is repeated until the performance improvement
plateaus. Additionally, we post process our results with Conditional Random
Fields. Our approach sets a high score on the public leaderboard for the ETCI
competition with 0.7654 IoU. Our method, which we release with all the code
including trained models, can also be used as an open science benchmark for the

(NMT) models with the pre-trained language models (LM) can speed up the model
training and boost the model performance. In this work, we identify a critical
side-effect of pre-training for NMT, which is due to the discrepancy between
the training objectives of LM-based pre-training and NMT. Since the LM
objective learns to reconstruct a few source tokens and copy most of them, the
pre-training initialization would affect the copying behaviors of NMT models.
We provide a quantitative analysis of copying behaviors by introducing a metric
called copying ratio, which empirically shows that pre-training based NMT
models have a larger copying ratio than the standard one. In response to this
problem, we propose a simple and effective method named copying penalty to
control the copying behaviors in decoding. Extensive experiments on both
in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks show that the copying penalty method
consistently improves translation performance by controlling copying behaviors
for pre-training based NMT models. Source code is freely available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With COVID-19 cases rising rapidly, deep learning has emerged as a promising
diagnosis technique. However, identifying the most accurate models to
characterize COVID-19 patients is challenging because comparing results
obtained with different types of data and acquisition processes is non-trivial.
In this paper we designed, evaluated, and compared the performance of 20
convolutional neutral networks in classifying patients as COVID-19 positive,
healthy, or suffering from other pulmonary lung infections based on Chest CT
scans, serving as the first to consider the EfficientNet family for COVID-19
diagnosis and employ intermediate activation maps for visualizing model
performance. All models are trained and evaluated in Python using 4173 Chest CT
images from the dataset entitled "A COVID multiclass dataset of CT scans," with
2168, 758, and 1247 images of patients that are COVID-19 positive, healthy, or
suffering from other pulmonary infections, respectively. EfficientNet-B5 was
identified as the best model with an F1 score of 0.9769+/-0.0046, accuracy of
0.9759+/-0.0048, sensitivity of 0.9788+/-0.0055, specificity of
0.9730+/-0.0057, and precision of 0.9751 +/- 0.0051. On an alternate 2-class
dataset, EfficientNetB5 obtained an accuracy of 0.9845+/-0.0109, F1 score of
0.9599+/-0.0251, sensitivity of 0.9682+/-0.0099, specificity of
0.9883+/-0.0150, and precision of 0.9526 +/- 0.0523. Intermediate activation
maps and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mappings offered
human-interpretable evidence of the model's perception of ground-class
opacities and consolidations, hinting towards a promising use-case of
artificial intelligence-assisted radiology tools. With a prediction speed of
under 0.1 seconds on GPUs and 0.5 seconds on CPUs, our proposed model offers a
rapid, scalable, and accurate diagnostic for COVID-19.]]></summary>

input $X$ and output $Y$. However, such paired data can be difficult to collect
in practice. In this paper, we consider the task of predicting $Y$ from $X$
when we have no paired data of them, but we have two separate, independent
datasets of $X$ and $Y$ each observed with some mediating variable $U$, that
is, we have two datasets $S_X = \{(X_i, U_i)\}$ and $S_Y = \{(U'_j, Y'_j)\}$. A
naive approach is to predict $U$ from $X$ using $S_X$ and then $Y$ from $U$
using $S_Y$, but we show that this is not statistically consistent. Moreover,
predicting $U$ can be more difficult than predicting $Y$ in practice, e.g.,
when $U$ has higher dimensionality. To circumvent the difficulty, we propose a
new method that avoids predicting $U$ but directly learns $Y = f(X)$ by
training $f(X)$ with $S_{X}$ to predict $h(U)$ which is trained with $S_{Y}$ to
approximate $Y$. We prove statistical consistency and error bounds of our
method and experimentally confirm its practical usefulness.]]></summary>

detection. A model trained with normal data generates a larger restoration
error for abnormal data. Whether or not abnormal data is determined by
observing the restoration error. It takes a lot of cost and time to obtain
abnormal data in the industrial field. Therefore the model trains only normal
data and detects abnormal data in the inference phase. However, the restoration
area for the input data of AE is limited in the latent space. To solve this
problem, we propose Multiple-hypothesis Autoencoder(MH-AE) model composed of
several decoders. MH-AE model increases the restoration area through contention
between decoders. The proposed method shows that the anomaly detection

model with very competitive generalization. However, SBL needs to invert a big
covariance matrix with complexity O(M^3 ) (M: feature size) for updating the
regularization priors, making it difficult for practical use. There are three
issues in SBL: 1) Inverting the covariance matrix may obtain singular solutions
in some cases, which hinders SBL from convergence; 2) Poor scalability to
problems with high dimensional feature space or large data size; 3) SBL easily
suffers from memory overflow for large-scale data. This paper addresses these
issues with a newly proposed diagonal Quasi-Newton (DQN) method for SBL called
DQN-SBL where the inversion of big covariance matrix is ignored so that the
complexity and memory storage are reduced to O(M). The DQN-SBL is thoroughly
evaluated on non-linear classifiers and linear feature selection using various
benchmark datasets of different sizes. Experimental results verify that DQN-SBL
receives competitive generalization with a very sparse model and scales well to
large-scale problems.]]></summary>

with independence assumption for modelling the span probability $P(a_s,a_e) =

has adverse effects. Therefore we propose multiple approaches to modelling

the compound objective is consistently superior or equal to other assumptions

demonstrating the impact of the compound objective on the real examples. Our

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Policy optimization is a widely-used method in reinforcement learning. Due to
its local-search nature, however, theoretical guarantees on global optimality
often rely on extra assumptions on the Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) that
bypass the challenge of global exploration. To eliminate the need of such
assumptions, in this work, we develop a general solution that adds dilated
bonuses to the policy update to facilitate global exploration. To showcase the
power and generality of this technique, we apply it to several episodic MDP
settings with adversarial losses and bandit feedback, improving and
generalizing the state-of-the-art. Specifically, in the tabular case, we obtain
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret where $T$ is the number of episodes,
improving the $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}({T}^{2/3})$ regret bound by Shani et al.
(2020). When the number of states is infinite, under the assumption that the
state-action values are linear in some low-dimensional features, we obtain
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}({T}^{2/3})$ regret with the help of a simulator,
matching the result of Neu and Olkhovskaya (2020) while importantly removing
the need of an exploratory policy that their algorithm requires. When a
simulator is unavailable, we further consider a linear MDP setting and obtain
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}({T}^{14/15})$ regret, which is the first result for
linear MDPs with adversarial losses and bandit feedback.]]></summary>

segmentation problem by providing full or weak-supervision through manually
annotated labels or self-supervised epoch-based training. Most works consider
videos that are at most 10's of minutes long. We present a self-supervised
perceptual prediction framework capable of temporal event segmentation by
building stable representations of objects over time and demonstrate it on long
videos, spanning several days. The approach is deceptively simple but quite
effective. We rely on predictions of high-level features computed by a standard
deep learning backbone. For prediction, we use an LSTM, augmented with an
attention mechanism, trained in a self-supervised manner using the prediction
error. The self-learned attention maps effectively localize and track the
event-related objects in each frame. The proposed approach does not require
labels. It requires only a single pass through the video, with no separate
training set. Given the lack of datasets of very long videos, we demonstrate
our method on video from 10 days (254 hours) of continuous wildlife monitoring
data that we had collected with required permissions. We find that the approach
is robust to various environmental conditions such as day/night conditions,
rain, sharp shadows, and windy conditions. For the task of temporally locating
events, we had an 80% recall rate at 20% false-positive rate for frame-level
segmentation. At the activity level, we had an 80% activity recall rate for one
false activity detection every 50 minutes. We will make the dataset, which is

pursuit (WPP), is a robust variant of the Wasserstein distance. Recent work
suggests that this quantity is more robust than the standard Wasserstein
distance, in particular when comparing probability measures in high-dimensions.
However, it is ruled out for practical application because the optimization
model is essentially non-convex and non-smooth which makes the computation
intractable. Our contribution in this paper is to revisit the original
motivation behind WPP/PRW, but take the hard route of showing that, despite its
non-convexity and lack of nonsmoothness, and even despite some hardness results
proved by~\citet{Niles-2019-Estimation} in a minimax sense, the original
formulation for PRW/WPP \textit{can} be efficiently computed in practice using
Riemannian optimization, yielding in relevant cases better behavior than its
convex relaxation. More specifically, we provide three simple algorithms with
solid theoretical guarantee on their complexity bound (one in the appendix),
and demonstrate their effectiveness and efficiency by conducing extensive
experiments on synthetic and real data. This paper provides a first step into a
computational theory of the PRW distance and provides the links between optimal
transport and Riemannian optimization.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present an information-based uncertainty quantification method for general
Markov Random Fields. Markov Random Fields (MRF) are structured, probabilistic
graphical models over undirected graphs, and provide a fundamental unifying
modeling tool for statistical mechanics, probabilistic machine learning, and
artificial intelligence. Typically MRFs are complex and high-dimensional with
nodes and edges (connections) built in a modular fashion from simpler,
low-dimensional probabilistic models and their local connections; in turn, this
modularity allows to incorporate available data to MRFs and efficiently
simulate them by leveraging their graph-theoretic structure. Learning graphical
models from data and/or constructing them from physical modeling and
constraints necessarily involves uncertainties inherited from data, modeling
choices, or numerical approximations. These uncertainties in the MRF can be
manifested either in the graph structure or the probability distribution
functions, and necessarily will propagate in predictions for quantities of
interest. Here we quantify such uncertainties using tight, information based
bounds on the predictions of quantities of interest; these bounds take
advantage of the graphical structure of MRFs and are capable of handling the
inherent high-dimensionality of such graphical models. We demonstrate our
methods in MRFs for medical diagnostics and statistical mechanics models. In
the latter, we develop uncertainty quantification bounds for finite size
effects and phase diagrams, which constitute two of the typical predictions
goals of statistical mechanics modeling.]]></summary>

important societal implication. Recently, there have been multiple attempts on
improving fairness of neural networks, with a focus on fairness testing (e.g.,
generating individual discriminatory instances) and fairness training (e.g.,
enhancing fairness through augmented training). In this work, we propose an
approach to formally verify neural networks against fairness, with a focus on
independence-based fairness such as group fairness. Our method is built upon an
approach for learning Markov Chains from a user-provided neural network (i.e.,
a feed-forward neural network or a recurrent neural network) which is
guaranteed to facilitate sound analysis. The learned Markov Chain not only
allows us to verify (with Probably Approximate Correctness guarantee) whether
the neural network is fair or not, but also facilities sensitivity analysis
which helps to understand why fairness is violated. We demonstrate that with
our analysis results, the neural weights can be optimized to improve fairness.
Our approach has been evaluated with multiple models trained on benchmark
datasets and the experiment results show that our approach is effective and
efficient.]]></summary>

(LTH) (Frankle & Carbin, 2018) pointed out that there could exist a winning
ticket (i.e., a properly pruned sub-network together with original weight
initialization) that can achieve competitive performance than the original
dense network. However, it is not easy to observe such winning property in many
scenarios, where for example, a relatively large learning rate is used even if
it benefits training the original dense model. In this work, we investigate the
underlying condition and rationale behind the winning property, and find that
the underlying reason is largely attributed to the correlation between
initialized weights and final-trained weights when the learning rate is not
sufficiently large. Thus, the existence of winning property is correlated with
an insufficient DNN pretraining, and is unlikely to occur for a well-trained
DNN. To overcome this limitation, we propose the "pruning & fine-tuning" method
that consistently outperforms lottery ticket sparse training under the same
pruning algorithm and the same total training epochs. Extensive experiments
over multiple deep models (VGG, ResNet, MobileNet-v2) on different datasets
have been conducted to justify our proposals.]]></summary>

its malignancy, it is graded by a pathologist into three grades according to
WHO standards. This grade plays a decisive role in treatment, and yet may be
subject to inter-rater discordance. In this work, we present and compare three
approaches towards fully automatic meningioma grading from histology whole
slide images. All approaches are following a two-stage paradigm, where we first
identify a region of interest based on the detection of mitotic figures in the
slide using a state-of-the-art object detection deep learning network. This
region of highest mitotic rate is considered characteristic for biological
tumor behavior. In the second stage, we calculate a score corresponding to
tumor malignancy based on information contained in this region using three
different settings. In a first approach, image patches are sampled from this
region and regression is based on morphological features encoded by a
ResNet-based network. We compare this to learning a logistic regression from
the determined mitotic count, an approach which is easily traceable and
explainable. Lastly, we combine both approaches in a single network. We trained
the pipeline on 951 slides from 341 patients and evaluated them on a separate
set of 141 slides from 43 patients. All approaches yield a high correlation to
the WHO grade. The logistic regression and the combined approach had the best
results in our experiments, yielding correct predictions in 32 and 33 of all
cases, respectively, with the image-based approach only predicting 25 cases
correctly. Spearman's correlation was 0.716, 0.792 and 0.790 respectively. It
may seem counterintuitive at first that morphological features provided by
image patches do not improve model performance. Yet, this mirrors the criteria
of the grading scheme, where mitotic count is the only unequivocal parameter.]]></summary>

In this work, we investigate approximate greedification when reducing the KL
divergence between the parameterized policy and the Boltzmann distribution over
action values. In particular, we investigate the difference between the forward
and reverse KL divergences, with varying degrees of entropy regularization. We
show that the reverse KL has stronger policy improvement guarantees, but that
reducing the forward KL can result in a worse policy. We also demonstrate,
however, that a large enough reduction of the forward KL can induce improvement
under additional assumptions. Empirically, we show on simple continuous-action
environments that the forward KL can induce more exploration, but at the cost
of a more suboptimal policy. No significant differences were observed in the
discrete-action setting or on a suite of benchmark problems. Throughout, we
highlight that many policy gradient methods can be seen as an instance of API,
with either the forward or reverse KL for the policy update, and discuss next
steps for understanding and improving our policy optimization algorithms.]]></summary>

widely used to reduce the model size and computational complexity of deep
neural network (DNN) for applications in power-constrained scenarios such as
embedded systems. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based auto-pruning has been
further proposed to automate the DNN pruning process to avoid expensive
hand-crafted work. However, the RL-based pruner involves a time-consuming
training process and the high expense of each sample further exacerbates this
problem. These impediments have greatly restricted the real-world application
of RL-based auto-pruning. Thus, in this paper, we propose an efficient
auto-pruning framework which solves this problem by taking advantage of the
historical data from the previous auto-pruning process. In our framework, we
first boost the convergence of the RL-pruner by transfer learning. Then, an
augmented transfer learning scheme is proposed to further speed up the training
process by improving the transferability. Finally, an assistant learning
process is proposed to improve the sample efficiency of the RL agent. The
experiments have shown that our framework can accelerate the auto-pruning
process by 1.5-2.5 times for ResNet20, and 1.81-2.375 times for other neural

Lykouris & Vassilvitskii [2] on learning-augmented online algorithms for
classical online optimization problems, in this work, we consider the Online
Facility Location problem under this framework. In Online Facility Location
(OFL), demands arrive one-by-one in a metric space and must be (irrevocably)
assigned to an open facility upon arrival, without any knowledge about future
demands.

We present an online algorithm for OFL that exploits potentially imperfect
predictions on the locations of the optimal facilities. We prove that the
competitive ratio decreases smoothly from sublogarithmic in the number of
demands to constant, as the error, i.e., the total distance of the predicted
locations to the optimal facility locations, decreases towards zero. We
complement our analysis with a matching lower bound establishing that the
dependence of the algorithm's competitive ratio on the error is optimal, up to
constant factors. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on real world data and
compare our learning augmented approach with the current best online algorithm
for the problem.]]></summary>

closed form expressions for the explanations output by these two methods and
show that they both converge to the same explanation in expectation, i.e., when
the number of perturbed samples used by these methods is large. We then
leverage this connection to establish other desirable properties, such as

their pace to use machine learning longitudinal motion planning (mMP) for
autonomous vehicles (AVs). This paper reviews the current state of the art in
mMP, with an exclusive focus on its impact on traffic congestion. We identify
the availability of congestion scenarios in current datasets, and summarize the
required features for training mMP. For learning methods, we survey the major
methods in both imitation learning and non-imitation learning. We also
highlight the emerging technologies adopted by some leading AV companies, e.g.
Tesla, Waymo, and Comma.ai. We find that: i) the AV industry has been mostly
focusing on the long tail problem related to safety and overlooked the impact
on traffic congestion, ii) the current public self-driving datasets have not
included enough congestion scenarios, and mostly lack the necessary input
features/output labels to train mMP, and iii) albeit reinforcement learning
(RL) approach can integrate congestion mitigation into the learning goal, the
major mMP method adopted by industry is still behavior cloning (BC), whose
capability to learn a congestion-mitigating mMP remains to be seen. Based on
the review, the study identifies the research gaps in current mMP development.
Some suggestions towards congestion mitigation for future mMP studies are
proposed: i) enrich data collection to facilitate the congestion learning, ii)
incorporate non-imitation learning methods to combine traffic efficiency into a
safety-oriented technical route, and iii) integrate domain knowledge from the
traditional car following (CF) theory to improve the string stability of mMP.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here, we introduce a fully local index named "sensitivity" for each neuron to
control chaoticity or gradient globally in a neural network (NN). We also
propose a learning method to adjust it named "sensitivity adjustment learning
(SAL)". The index is the gradient magnitude of its output with respect to its
inputs. By adjusting its time average to 1.0 in each neuron, information
transmission in the neuron changes to be moderate without shrinking or
expanding for both forward and backward computations. That results in moderate
information transmission through a layer of neurons when the weights and inputs
are random. Therefore, SAL can control the chaoticity of the network dynamics
in a recurrent NN (RNN). It can also solve the vanishing gradient problem in
error backpropagation (BP) learning in a deep feedforward NN or an RNN. We
demonstrate that when applying SAL to an RNN with small and random initial
weights, log-sensitivity, which is the logarithm of RMS (root mean square)
sensitivity over all the neurons, is equivalent to the maximum Lyapunov
exponent until it reaches 0.0. We also show that SAL works with BP or BPTT (BP
through time) to avoid the vanishing gradient problem in a 300-layer NN or an
RNN that learns a problem with a lag of 300 steps between the first input and
the output. Compared with manually fine-tuning the spectral radius of the
weight matrix before learning, SAL's continuous nonlinear learning nature
prevents loss of sensitivities during learning, resulting in a significant
improvement in learning performance.]]></summary>

approach to robot manipulation of novel objects ab initio, without prior object
models or pre-training on a large object data set. The key element of Prompt is
a particle-based object representation, in which each particle represents a
point in the object, the local geometric, physical, and other features of the
point, and also its relation with other particles. Like the model-based
analytic approaches to manipulation, the particle representation enables the
robot to reason about the object's geometry and dynamics in order to choose
suitable manipulation actions. Like the data-driven approaches, the particle
representation is learned online in real-time from visual sensor input,
specifically, multi-view RGB images. The particle representation thus connects
visual perception with robot control. Prompt combines the benefits of both
model-based reasoning and data-driven learning. We show empirically that Prompt
successfully handles a variety of everyday objects, some of which are
transparent. It handles various manipulation tasks, including grasping,
pushing, etc,. Our experiments also show that Prompt outperforms a
state-of-the-art data-driven grasping method on the daily objects, even though
it does not use any offline training data.]]></summary>

classification and bounding-box regression. Generally, they select the
bounding-box with maximum classification confidence as the final prediction.
This strategy may miss the right result due to the accuracy misalignment
between classification and regression. In this paper, we propose a novel
siamese tracking algorithm called SiamRCR, addressing this problem with a
simple, light and effective solution. It builds reciprocal links between
classification and regression branches, which can dynamically re-weight their
losses for each positive sample. In addition, we add a localization branch to
predict the localization accuracy, so that it can work as the replacement of
the regression assistance link during inference. This branch makes the training
and inference more consistent. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of SiamRCR and its superiority over the state-of-the-art
competitors on GOT-10k, LaSOT, TrackingNet, OTB-2015, VOT-2018 and VOT-2019.

being non-invasive, unobtrusive, not requiring cooperation and being less
likely to be obscured compared to other biometrics. Existing methods for gait
recognition require cooperative gait scenarios, in which a single person is
walking multiple times in a straight line in front of a camera. We aim to
address the hard challenges of real-world scenarios in which camera feeds
capture multiple people, who in most cases pass in front of the camera only
once. We address privacy concerns by using only the motion information of
walking individuals, with no identifiable appearance-based information. As
such, we propose a novel weakly supervised learning framework, WildGait, which
consists of training a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network on a large
number of automatically annotated skeleton sequences obtained from raw,
real-world, surveillance streams to learn useful gait signatures. Our results
show that, with fine-tuning, we surpass in terms of recognition accuracy the
current state-of-the-art pose-based gait recognition solutions. Our proposed
method is reliable in training gait recognition methods in unconstrained
environments, especially in settings with scarce amounts of annotated data.]]></summary>

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as the responsibility to process an
adequate, relevant, and limited amount of personal data in relation to a
processing purpose. However, unlike fairness or transparency, the principle has
not seen wide adoption for machine learning systems due to a lack of
computational interpretation. In this paper, we build on literature in machine
learning and law to propose the first learning framework for limiting data
collection based on an interpretation that ties the data collection purpose to
system performance. We formalize a data minimization criterion based on
performance curve derivatives and provide an effective and interpretable
piecewise power law technique that models distinct stages of an algorithm's
performance throughout data collection. Results from our empirical
investigation offer deeper insights into the relevant considerations when
designing a data minimization framework, including the choice of feature
acquisition algorithm, initialization conditions, as well as impacts on

obtain nearly-optimal bounds for various problems such as rank computation,
finding a maximal linearly independent subset of columns, regression, low rank
approximation, maximum matching on general graphs and linear matroid union, one
would need to resolve the main open question of Nelson and Nguyen (FOCS, 2013)
regarding the logarithmic factors in the sketching dimension for existing
constant factor approximation oblivious subspace embeddings. We show how to
bypass this question using a refined sketching technique, and obtain optimal or
nearly optimal bounds for these problems. A key technique we use is an explicit
mapping of Indyk based on uncertainty principles and extractors, which after
first applying known oblivious subspace embeddings, allows us to quickly spread
out the mass of the vector so that sampling is now effective, and we avoid a
logarithmic factor that is standard in the sketching dimension resulting from
matrix Chernoff bounds. For the fundamental problems of rank computation and
finding a linearly independent subset of columns, our algorithms improve
Cheung, Kwok, and Lau (JACM, 2013) and are optimal to within a constant factor
and a $\log\log(n)$-factor, respectively. Further, for constant factor
regression and low rank approximation we give the first optimal algorithms, for

ability when trained on large pixel-wise annotated image datasets. It remains a
major challenge however to aggregate such datasets, as the time and monetary
cost associated with collecting extensive annotations is extremely high. This
is particularly the case for generating precise pixel-wise annotations in video
and volumetric image data. To this end, this work presents a novel framework to
produce pixel-wise segmentations using minimal supervision. Our method relies
on 2D point supervision, whereby a single 2D location within an object of
interest is provided on each image of the data. Our method then estimates the
object appearance in a semi-supervised fashion by learning
object-image-specific features and by using these in a semi-supervised learning
framework. Our object model is then used in a graph-based optimization problem
that takes into account all provided locations and the image data in order to
infer the complete pixel-wise segmentation. In practice, we solve this
optimally as a tracking problem using a K-shortest path approach. Both the
object model and segmentation are then refined iteratively to further improve
the final segmentation. We show that by collecting 2D locations using a gaze
tracker, our approach can provide state-of-the-art segmentations on a range of
objects and image modalities (video and 3D volumes), and that these can then be
used to train supervised machine learning classifiers.]]></summary>

requirements (e.g., collecting outlier data and hyperparameter validation) and
produce side effects (classification accuracy drop and slow/inefficient
inferences). Recently, entropic out-of-distribution detection has been proposed
as a seamless approach (i.e., a solution that avoids all the previously
mentioned drawbacks). The entropic out-of-distribution detection solution
comprises the IsoMax loss for training and the entropic score for
out-of-distribution detection. The IsoMax loss works as a SoftMax loss drop-in
replacement because swapping the SoftMax loss with the IsoMax loss requires no
changes in the model's architecture or training procedures/hyperparameters. In
this paper, we propose to perform what we call an isometrization of the
distances used in the IsoMax loss. Additionally, we propose to replace the
entropic score with the minimum distance score. Our experiments showed that
these simple modifications increase out-of-distribution detection performance
while keeping the solution seamless. Code available at

robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. However, existing methods assume
that training and testing data are from the same domain, which suffers from
severe performance degradation when a domain gap exists, such as the simulator
and real robot. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised domain
adaptation framework which can simultaneously transfer multi-modality
knowledge, i.e., both kinematic and visual data, from simulator to real robot.
It remedies the domain gap with enhanced transferable features by using
temporal cues in videos, and inherent correlations in multi-modal towards
recognizing gesture. Specifically, we first propose an MDO-K to align
kinematics, which exploits temporal continuity to transfer motion directions
with smaller gap rather than position values, relieving the adaptation burden.
Moreover, we propose a KV-Relation-ATT to transfer the co-occurrence signals of
kinematics and vision. Such features attended by correlation similarity are
more informative for enhancing domain-invariance of the model. Two feature
alignment strategies benefit the model mutually during the end-to-end learning
process. We extensively evaluate our method for gesture recognition using DESK
dataset with peg transfer procedure. Results show that our approach recovers
the performance with great improvement gains, up to 12.91% in ACC and 20.16% in
F1score without using any annotations in real robot.]]></summary>

environment requires a superior potential controller such as hierarchical
reinforcement learning (HRL) rather than an atomic RL because it absorbs the
complexity of commands to achieve the purpose of the task in its hierarchical
structure. One of the HRL issues is how to train each level policy with the
optimal data collection from its experience. That is to say, how to synchronize
adjacent level policies optimally. Our research finds that a HRL model through
the off-policy correction technique of HRL, which trains a higher-level policy
with the goal of reflecting a lower-level policy which is newly trained using
the off-policy method, takes the critical role of synchronizing both level
policies at all times while they are being trained. We propose a novel HRL
model supporting the optimal level synchronization using the off-policy
correction technique with a deep generative model. This uses the advantage of
the inverse operation of a flow-based deep generative model (FDGM) to achieve
the goal corresponding to the current state of the lower-level policy. The
proposed model also considers the freedom of the goal dimension between HRL
policies which makes it the generalized inverse model of the model-free RL in
HRL with the optimal synchronization method. The comparative experiment results

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recurrence data arise from multi-disciplinary domains spanning reliability,
cyber security, healthcare, online retailing, etc. This paper investigates an
additive-tree-based approach, known as Boost-R (Boosting for Recurrence Data),
for recurrent event data with both static and dynamic features. Boost-R
constructs an ensemble of gradient boosted additive trees to estimate the
cumulative intensity function of the recurrent event process, where a new tree
is added to the ensemble by minimizing the regularized L2 distance between the
observed and predicted cumulative intensity. Unlike conventional regression
trees, a time-dependent function is constructed by Boost-R on each tree leaf.
The sum of these functions, from multiple trees, yields the ensemble estimator
of the cumulative intensity. The divide-and-conquer nature of tree-based
methods is appealing when hidden sub-populations exist within a heterogeneous
population. The non-parametric nature of regression trees helps to avoid
parametric assumptions on the complex interactions between event processes and
features. Critical insights and advantages of Boost-R are investigated through
comprehensive numerical examples. Datasets and computer code of Boost-R are
made available on GitHub. To our best knowledge, Boost-R is the first gradient
boosted additive-tree-based approach for modeling large-scale recurrent event
data with both static and dynamic feature information.]]></summary>

from medical images are important, especially in the diagnosis and treatment
management for patients suffering from myocardial infarction (MI). Late
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) provides an
important protocol to visualize MI. However, automated segmentation of LGE CMR
is still challenging, due to the indistinguishable boundaries, heterogeneous
intensity distribution and complex enhancement patterns of pathological
myocardium from LGE CMR. Furthermore, compared with the other sequences LGE CMR
images with gold standard labels are particularly limited, which represents
another obstacle for developing novel algorithms for automatic segmentation of
LGE CMR. This paper presents the selective results from the Multi-Sequence
Cardiac MR (MS-CMR) Segmentation challenge, in conjunction with MICCAI 2019.
The challenge offered a data set of paired MS-CMR images, including auxiliary
CMR sequences as well as LGE CMR, from 45 patients who underwent
cardiomyopathy. It was aimed to develop new algorithms, as well as benchmark
existing ones for LGE CMR segmentation and compare them objectively. In
addition, the paired MS-CMR images could enable algorithms to combine the
complementary information from the other sequences for the segmentation of LGE
CMR. Nine representative works were selected for evaluation and comparisons,
among which three methods are unsupervised methods and the other six are
supervised. The results showed that the average performance of the nine methods
was comparable to the inter-observer variations. The success of these methods
was mainly attributed to the inclusion of the auxiliary sequences from the
MS-CMR images, which provide important label information for the training of
deep neural networks.]]></summary>

centroids from microscopy images. Recently, convolutional neural network-based
approaches have achieved promising performance. However, these methods require
a certain amount of annotation for each imaging condition. This annotation is a
time-consuming and labor-intensive task. To overcome this problem, we propose a
semi-supervised cell-detection method that effectively uses a time-lapse
sequence with one labeled image and the other images unlabeled. First, we train
a cell-detection network with a one-labeled image and estimate the unlabeled
images with the trained network. We then select high-confidence positions from
the estimations by tracking the detected cells from the labeled frame to those
far from it. Next, we generate pseudo-labels from the tracking results and
train the network by using pseudo-labels. We evaluated our method for seven
conditions of public datasets, and we achieved the best results relative to
other semi-supervised methods. Our code is available at

estimate exact locations of human heads in the given crowded videos. To model
spatial-temporal dependencies of human mobility, we propose a multi-focus

correspondences while maintaining the spatial topological structure of the

human heads well using the equipped multi-focus mechanism. Based on the
multi-focus GNA, we develop a unified neural network called GNANet to
accurately locate head centers in video clips by fully aggregating
spatial-temporal information via a scene modeling module and a context
cross-attention module. Moreover, to facilitate future researches in this
field, we introduce a large-scale crowded video benchmark named SenseCrowd,
which consists of 60K+ frames captured in various surveillance scenarios and
2M+ head annotations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three

Aware Embedding Network (TAEN) for few-shot action recognition, that learns to
represent actions, in a metric space as a trajectory, conveying both short term
semantics and longer term connectivity between action parts. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of TAEN on two few shot tasks, video classification and temporal
action detection and evaluate our method on the Kinetics-400 and on ActivityNet

critical role in many practical applications, such as urban planning,
environmental protection, natural and anthropogenic landscape monitoring, etc.
However, the automation of semantic segmentation, i.e., automatic
categorization/labeling and segmentation is still a challenging task,
particularly for fine-resolution images with huge spatial and spectral
complexity. Addressing such a problem represents an exciting research field,
which paves the way for scene-level landscape pattern analysis and decision
making. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatic land segmentation
based on the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). As a classic architecture, FPN can
build a feature pyramid with high-level semantics throughout. However,
intrinsic defects in feature extraction and fusion hinder FPN from further
aggregating more discriminative features. Hence, we propose an Attention
Aggregation Module (AAM) to enhance multi-scale feature learning through
attention-guided feature aggregation. Based on FPN and AAM, a novel framework
named Attention Aggregation Feature Pyramid Network (A2-FPN) is developed for
semantic segmentation of fine-resolution remotely sensed images. Extensive
experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our A2
-FPN in segmentation accuracy. Code is available at

In this paper we designed, evaluated, and compared the performance of 20
convolutional neutral networks in classifying patients as COVID-19 positive,
healthy, or suffering from other pulmonary lung infections based on Chest CT
scans, serving as the first to consider the EfficientNet family for COVID-19
diagnosis and employ intermediate activation maps for visualizing model
performance. All models are trained and evaluated in Python using 4173 Chest CT
images from the dataset entitled "A COVID multiclass dataset of CT scans," with
2168, 758, and 1247 images of patients that are COVID-19 positive, healthy, or
suffering from other pulmonary infections, respectively. EfficientNet-B5 was
identified as the best model with an F1 score of 0.9769+/-0.0046, accuracy of
0.9759+/-0.0048, sensitivity of 0.9788+/-0.0055, specificity of

maps and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mappings offered
human-interpretable evidence of the model's perception of ground-class
opacities and consolidations, hinting towards a promising use-case of
artificial intelligence-assisted radiology tools. With a prediction speed of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The current standard for a variety of computer vision tasks using smaller
numbers of labelled training examples is to fine-tune from weights pre-trained
on a large image classification dataset such as ImageNet. The application of
transfer learning and transfer learning methods tends to be rigidly binary. A
model is either pre-trained or not pre-trained. Pre-training a model either
increases performance or decreases it, the latter being defined as negative
transfer. Application of L2-SP regularisation that decays the weights towards
their pre-trained values is either applied or all weights are decayed towards
0. This paper re-examines these assumptions. Our recommendations are based on
extensive empirical evaluation that demonstrate the application of a non-binary
approach to achieve optimal results. (1) Achieving best performance on each
individual dataset requires careful adjustment of various transfer learning
hyperparameters not usually considered, including number of layers to transfer,
different learning rates for different layers and different combinations of
L2SP and L2 regularization. (2) Best practice can be achieved using a number of
measures of how well the pre-trained weights fit the target dataset to guide
optimal hyperparameters. We present methods for non-binary transfer learning
including combining L2SP and L2 regularization and performing non-traditional
fine-tuning hyperparameter searches. Finally we suggest heuristics for
determining the optimal transfer learning hyperparameters. The benefits of
using a non-binary approach are supported by final results that come close to
or exceed state of the art performance on a variety of tasks that have
traditionally been more difficult for transfer learning.]]></summary>

techniques have been applied, achieving extremely high accuracies and preparing
highly robust FER systems still remains a challenge due to heterogeneous
details in human faces. In this paper, we will be deep diving into implementing
a system for recognition of facial expressions (FER) by leveraging neural
networks, and more specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We adopt
the fundamental concepts of deep learning and computer vision with various
architectures, fine-tune it's hyperparameters and experiment with various
optimization methods and demonstrate a state-of-the-art single-network-accuracy
of 70.10% on the FER2013 dataset without using any additional training data.]]></summary>

space which makes it very difficult to independently control a specific
attribute without affecting the others. Supervised attribute editing requires
annotated training data which is difficult to obtain and limits the editable
attributes to those with labels. Therefore, unsupervised attribute editing in
an disentangled latent space is key to performing neat and versatile semantic
face editing. In this paper, we present a new technique termed
Structure-Texture Independent Architecture with Weight Decomposition and
Orthogonal Regularization (STIA-WO) to disentangle the latent space for
unsupervised semantic face editing. By applying STIA-WO to GAN, we have
developed a StyleGAN termed STGAN-WO which performs weight decomposition
through utilizing the style vector to construct a fully controllable weight
matrix to regulate image synthesis, and employs orthogonal regularization to
ensure each entry of the style vector only controls one independent feature
matrix. To further disentangle the facial attributes, STGAN-WO introduces a
structure-texture independent architecture which utilizes two independently and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) latent vectors to control the synthesis of the
texture and structure components in a disentangled way. Unsupervised semantic
editing is achieved by moving the latent code in the coarse layers along its
orthogonal directions to change texture related attributes or changing the
latent code in the fine layers to manipulate structure related ones. We present
experimental results which show that our new STGAN-WO can achieve better
attribute editing than state of the art methods.]]></summary>

collects and implements a wide range of popular deep learning-based methods for
face recognition. First of all, face.evoLVe is composed of key components that
cover the full process of face analytics, including face alignment, data
processing, various backbones, losses, and alternatives with bags of tricks for
improving performance. Later, face.evoLVe supports multi-GPU training on top of
different deep learning platforms, such as PyTorch and PaddlePaddle, which
facilitates researchers to work on both large-scale datasets with millions of
images and low-shot counterparts with limited well-annotated data. More
importantly, along with face.evoLVe, images before & after alignment in the
common benchmark datasets are released with source codes and trained models
provided. All these efforts lower the technical burdens in reproducing the
existing methods for comparison, while users of our library could focus on
developing advanced approaches more efficiently. Last but not least,
face.evoLVe is well designed and vibrantly evolving, so that new face
recognition approaches can be easily plugged into our framework. Note that we
have used face.evoLVe to participate in a number of face recognition
competitions and secured the first place. The version that supports PyTorch is
publicly available at https://github.com/ZhaoJ9014/face.evoLVe.PyTorch and the
PaddlePaddle version is available at

matching generative adversarial network (PSIGAN) for unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) and multi-organ segmentation from magnetic resonance (MRI)
images. Our UDA approach models the co-dependency between images and their
segmentation as a joint probability distribution using a new structure
discriminator. The structure discriminator computes structure of interest
focused adversarial loss by combining the generated pseudo MRI with
probabilistic segmentations produced by a simultaneously trained segmentation
sub-network. The segmentation sub-network is trained using the pseudo MRI
produced by the generator sub-network. This leads to a cyclical optimization of
both the generator and segmentation sub-networks that are jointly trained as
part of an end-to-end network. Extensive experiments and comparisons against
multiple state-of-the-art methods were done on four different MRI sequences
totalling 257 scans for generating multi-organ and tumor segmentation. The
experiments included, (a) 20 T1-weighted (T1w) in-phase mdixon and (b) 20
T2-weighted (T2w) abdominal MRI for segmenting liver, spleen, left and right
kidneys, (c) 162 T2-weighted fat suppressed head and neck MRI (T2wFS) for
parotid gland segmentation, and (d) 75 T2w MRI for lung tumor segmentation. Our

concerned with the anticipation of the unobserved future from the current as
well as historical video observations. Action prediction is a major sub-area of
video predictive understanding and is the focus of this review. This sub-area
has two major subdivisions: early action recognition and future action
prediction. Early action recognition is concerned with recognizing an ongoing
action as soon as possible. Future action prediction is concerned with the
anticipation of actions that follow those previously observed. In either case,
the \textbf{\textit{causal}} relationship between the past, current, and
potential future information is the main focus. Various mathematical tools such
as Markov Chains, Gaussian Processes, Auto-Regressive modeling, and Bayesian
recursive filtering are widely adopted jointly with computer vision techniques
for these two tasks. However, these approaches face challenges such as the
curse of dimensionality, poor generalization, and constraints from
domain-specific knowledge. Recently, structures that rely on deep convolutional
neural networks and recurrent neural networks have been extensively proposed
for improving the performance of existing vision tasks, in general, and action
prediction tasks, in particular. However, they have their own shortcomings, \eg
reliance on massive training data and lack of strong theoretical underpinnings.
In this survey, we start by introducing the major sub-areas of the broad area
of video predictive understanding, which recently have received intensive
attention and proven to have practical value. Next, a thorough review of
various early action recognition and future action prediction algorithms are
provided with suitably organized divisions. Finally, we conclude our discussion
with future research directions.]]></summary>

Our hierarchical GNN uses a novel approach to merge connected components

Unlike fully unsupervised hierarchical clustering, the choice of grouping and
complexity criteria stems naturally from supervision in the training set. The
resulting method, Hi-LANDER, achieves an average of 54% improvement in F-score

GNN-based clustering algorithms. Additionally, state-of-the-art GNN-based
methods rely on separate models to predict linkage probabilities and node

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background and objective: In this paper, a modified U-Net based framework is
presented, which leverages techniques from Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block,
Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and residual learning for accurate and
robust liver CT segmentation, and the effectiveness of the proposed method was
tested on two public datasets LiTS17 and SLiver07.

Methods: A new network architecture called SAR-U-Net was designed. Firstly,
the SE block is introduced to adaptively extract image features after each
convolution in the U-Net encoder, while suppressing irrelevant regions, and
highlighting features of specific segmentation task; Secondly, ASPP was
employed to replace the transition layer and the output layer, and acquire
multi-scale image information via different receptive fields. Thirdly, to
alleviate the degradation problem, the traditional convolution block was
replaced with the residual block and thus prompt the network to gain accuracy
from considerably increased depth.

Results: In the LiTS17 experiment, the mean values of Dice, VOE, RVD, ASD and
MSD were 95.71, 9.52, -0.84, 1.54 and 29.14, respectively. Compared with other
closely related 2D-based models, the proposed method achieved the highest
accuracy. In the experiment of the SLiver07, the mean values of Dice, VOE, RVD,
ASD and MSD were 97.31, 5.37, -1.08, 1.85 and 27.45, respectively. Compared
with other closely related models, the proposed method achieved the highest
segmentation accuracy except for the RVD.

Conclusion: The proposed model enables a great improvement on the accuracy
compared to 2D-based models, and its robustness in circumvent challenging
problems, such as small liver regions, discontinuous liver regions, and fuzzy
liver boundaries, is also well demonstrated and validated.]]></summary>

properties of the data source that we can rely on to hypothesize about its
imbalance, such as distribution of land and water in the case of the Earth's
imagery. We present a new iterative method to balance unlabeled data. Our
method utilizes image embeddings as a proxy for image labels that can be used
to balance data, and ultimately when trained increases overall accuracy.]]></summary>

humans yet challenging for machines to reproduce. This is because most learning
algorithms strongly rely on the i.i.d.~assumption on source/target data, which
is often violated in practice due to domain shift. Domain generalization (DG)
aims to achieve OOD generalization by using only source data for model
learning. Since first introduced in 2011, research in DG has made great
progresses. In particular, intensive research in this topic has led to a broad
spectrum of methodologies, e.g., those based on domain alignment,
meta-learning, data augmentation, or ensemble learning, just to name a few; and
has covered various vision applications such as object recognition,
segmentation, action recognition, and person re-identification. In this paper,
for the first time a comprehensive literature review is provided to summarize
the developments in DG for computer vision over the past decade. Specifically,
we first cover the background by formally defining DG and relating it to other
research fields like domain adaptation and transfer learning. Second, we
conduct a thorough review into existing methods and present a categorization
based on their methodologies and motivations. Finally, we conclude this survey
with insights and discussions on future research directions.]]></summary>

and assess incurred damages, among other response tasks. As the volume and

computer vision and deep neural networks have enabled the development of models
for real-time image classification for a number of tasks, including detecting
crisis incidents, filtering irrelevant images, classifying images into specific
humanitarian categories, and assessing the severity of the damage. To develop
robust real-time models, it is necessary to understand the capability of the
publicly available pre-trained models for these tasks, which remains to be
under-explored in the crisis informatics literature. In this study, we address
such limitations by investigating ten different network architectures for four
different tasks using the largest publicly available datasets for these tasks.
We also explore various data augmentation strategies, semi-supervised

thus high-dimensional (e.g., design, text). Instead of treating unstructured
attributes as unobservables in economic models, quantifying them can be
important to answer interesting economic questions. To propose an analytical
framework for this type of products, this paper considers one of the simplest
design products -- fonts -- and investigates merger and product differentiation
using an original dataset from the world's largest online marketplace for
fonts. We quantify font shapes by constructing embeddings from a deep
convolutional neural network. Each embedding maps a font's shape onto a
low-dimensional vector. In the resulting product space, designers are assumed
to engage in Hotelling-type spatial competition. From the image embeddings, we
construct two alternative measures that capture the degree of design
differentiation. We then study the causal effects of a merger on the merging
firm's creative decisions using the constructed measures in a synthetic control
method. We find that the merger causes the merging firm to increase the visual
variety of font design. Notably, such effects are not captured when using
traditional measures for product offerings (e.g., specifications and the number

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we propose a similarity-aware fusion network (SAFNet) to
adaptively fuse 2D images and 3D point clouds for 3D semantic segmentation.
Existing fusion-based methods achieve remarkable performances by integrating
information from multiple modalities. However, they heavily rely on the
correspondence between 2D pixels and 3D points by projection and can only
perform the information fusion in a fixed manner, and thus their performances
cannot be easily migrated to a more realistic scenario where the collected data
often lack strict pair-wise features for prediction. To address this, we employ
a late fusion strategy where we first learn the geometric and contextual
similarities between the input and back-projected (from 2D pixels) point clouds
and utilize them to guide the fusion of two modalities to further exploit
complementary information. Specifically, we employ a geometric similarity
module (GSM) to directly compare the spatial coordinate distributions of
pair-wise 3D neighborhoods, and a contextual similarity module (CSM) to
aggregate and compare spatial contextual information of corresponding central
points. The two proposed modules can effectively measure how much image
features can help predictions, enabling the network to adaptively adjust the
contributions of two modalities to the final prediction of each point.
Experimental results on the ScanNetV2 benchmark demonstrate that SAFNet
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art fusion-based approaches
across various data integrity.]]></summary>

restrictions on data availability. To still obtain viable models, continual
learning aims to train in sequential order, as and when data is available. The
main challenge that continual learning methods face is to prevent catastrophic
forgetting, i.e., a decrease in performance on the data encountered earlier.
This issue makes continuous training of segmentation models for medical
applications extremely difficult. Yet, often, data from at least two different
domains is available which we can exploit to train the model in a way that it
disregards domain-specific information. We propose an architecture that
leverages the simultaneous availability of two or more datasets to learn a
disentanglement between the content and domain in an adversarial fashion. The
domain-invariant content representation then lays the base for continual
semantic segmentation. Our approach takes inspiration from domain adaptation
and combines it with continual learning for hippocampal segmentation in brain
MRI. We showcase that our method reduces catastrophic forgetting and
outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods.]]></summary>

and then relaxed to allow the primitive's parameters to be learned. This
relaxation allows end-to-end differentiable programs and deep networks to be

to be composed in ways that can mimic the physical reality of drawing rather

cancer computer-aided diagnosis and surgical planning. However, both the
accuracy and robustness of existing liver segmentation methods cannot meet the
requirements of clinical applications. In particular, for the common clinical
cases where the liver tissue contains major pathology, current segmentation
methods show poor performance. In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank
tensor decomposition (LRTD) based multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) framework that
achieves accurate and robust pathological liver segmentation of CT images.
Firstly, we propose a multi-slice LRTD scheme to recover the underlying
low-rank structure embedded in 3D medical images. It performs the LRTD on small
image segments consisting of multiple consecutive image slices. Then, we
present an LRTD-based atlas construction method to generate tumor-free liver
atlases that mitigates the performance degradation of liver segmentation due to
the presence of tumors. Finally, we introduce an LRTD-based MAS algorithm to
derive patient-specific liver atlases for each test image, and to achieve
accurate pairwise image registration and label propagation. Extensive
experiments on three public databases of pathological liver cases validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Both qualitative and quantitative results
demonstrate that, in the presence of major pathology, the proposed method is
more accurate and robust than state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

re-generated using the peak positions in the predicted heatmap to have a clear

domain to the target domain in a semi-supervised manner. In the experiments
using 8 combinations of domains, the proposed method outperformed the existing

incorporate a weighted difference of anisotropic and isotropic total variation
(AITV) to regularize the partition boundaries in an image. In particular, we
replace the total variation regularization in the Chan-Vese segmentation model
and a fuzzy region competition model by the proposed AITV. To deal with the
nonconvex nature of AITV, we apply the difference-of-convex algorithm (DCA), in
which the subproblems can be minimized by the primal-dual hybrid gradient
method with linesearch. The convergence of the DCA scheme is analyzed. In
addition, a generalization to color image segmentation is discussed. In the
numerical experiments, we compare the proposed models with the classic convex

creates a bridge between the Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision
domains of computer science. The task of generating a semantically accurate
description of a video is quite complex. Considering the complexity, of the
problem, the results obtained in recent research works are praiseworthy.
However, there is plenty of scope for further investigation. This paper
addresses this scope and proposes a novel solution. Most video captioning
models comprise two sequential/recurrent layers - one as a video-to-context
encoder and the other as a context-to-caption decoder. This paper proposes a
novel architecture, namely Semantically Sensible Video Captioning (SSVC) which
modifies the context generation mechanism by using two novel approaches -
"stacked attention" and "spatial hard pull". As there are no exclusive metrics
for evaluating video captioning models, we emphasize both quantitative and
qualitative analysis of our model. Hence, we have used the BLEU scoring metric
for quantitative analysis and have proposed a human evaluation metric for
qualitative analysis, namely the Semantic Sensibility (SS) scoring metric. SS
Score overcomes the shortcomings of common automated scoring metrics. This
paper reports that the use of the aforementioned novelties improves the
performance of state-of-the-art architectures.]]></summary>

attention and progress. State-of-the-art approaches adopting Graph
Convolutional networks (GCNs) can effectively extract features on human
skeletons relying on the pre-defined human topology. Despite associated
progress, GCN-based methods have difficulties to generalize across domains,
especially with different human topological structures. In this context, we
introduce UNIK, a novel skeleton-based action recognition method that is not
only effective to learn spatio-temporal features on human skeleton sequences
but also able to generalize across datasets. This is achieved by learning an
optimal dependency matrix from the uniform distribution based on a multi-head
attention mechanism. Subsequently, to study the cross-domain generalizability
of skeleton-based action recognition in real-world videos, we re-evaluate
state-of-the-art approaches as well as the proposed UNIK in light of a novel
Posetics dataset. This dataset is created from Kinetics-400 videos by
estimating, refining and filtering poses. We provide an analysis on how much
performance improves on smaller benchmark datasets after pre-training on
Posetics for the action classification task. Experimental results show that the
proposed UNIK, with pre-training on Posetics, generalizes well and outperforms
state-of-the-art when transferred onto four target action classification
datasets: Toyota Smarthome, Penn Action, NTU-RGB+D 60 and NTU-RGB+D 120.]]></summary>

pixel-wise visual features into the elevation map grids. In this way, we fuse
the structural features and visual features in the consistent bird-eye view
frame, yielding a semantic representation, namely CORAL. And the whole network
is called CORAL-VLAD. Comparisons on the Oxford RobotCar show that CORAL-VLAD

computer-assisted diagnosis and therapy systems, yet still faces many
challenges. In the past few years, the popular encoder-decoder architectures
based on CNNs (e.g., U-Net) have been successfully applied in the task of
medical image segmentation. However, due to the locality of convolution
operations, they demonstrate limitations in learning global context and
long-range spatial relations. Recently, several researchers try to introduce
transformers to both the encoder and decoder components with promising results,
but the efficiency requires further improvement due to the high computational
complexity of transformers. In this paper, we propose LeViT-UNet, which
integrates a LeViT Transformer module into the U-Net architecture, for fast and
accurate medical image segmentation. Specifically, we use LeViT as the encoder
of the LeViT-UNet, which better trades off the accuracy and efficiency of the
Transformer block. Moreover, multi-scale feature maps from transformer blocks
and convolutional blocks of LeViT are passed into the decoder via
skip-connection, which can effectively reuse the spatial information of the
feature maps. Our experiments indicate that the proposed LeViT-UNet achieves
better performance comparing to various competing methods on several
challenging medical image segmentation benchmarks including Synapse and ACDC.

auto-encoder, contrastive learning) allow deep learning models to learn
effective image representations from large-scale unlabeled data. In medical
image analysis, even unannotated data can be difficult to obtain for individual
labs. Fortunately, national-level efforts have been made to provide efficient
access to obtain biomedical image data from previous scientific publications.
For instance, NIH has launched the Open-i search engine that provides a
large-scale image database with free access. However, the images in scientific
publications consist of a considerable amount of compound figures with
subplots. To extract and curate individual subplots, many different compound
figure separation approaches have been developed, especially with the recent
advances in deep learning. However, previous approaches typically required
resource extensive bounding box annotation to train detection models. In this
paper, we propose a simple compound figure separation (SimCFS) framework that
uses weak classification annotations from individual images. Our technical
contribution is three-fold: (1) we introduce a new side loss that is designed
for compound figure separation; (2) we introduce an intra-class image
augmentation method to simulate hard cases; (3) the proposed framework enables
an efficient deployment to new classes of images, without requiring resource
extensive bounding box annotations. From the results, the SimCFS achieved a new
state-of-the-art performance on the ImageCLEF 2016 Compound Figure Separation
Database. The source code of SimCFS is made publicly available at

promising compression performance. Our work presents the first attempt to
leverage VAE-based compression in a flow-based framework. ANFIC advances
further compression efficiency by stacking and extending hierarchically
multiple VAE's. The invertibility of ANF, together with our training
strategies, enables ANFIC to support a wide range of quality levels without
changing the encoding and decoding networks. Extensive experimental results
show that in terms of PSNR-RGB, ANFIC performs comparably to or better than the
state-of-the-art learned image compression. Moreover, it performs close to VVC
intra coding, from low-rate compression up to nearly-lossless compression. In

-- a successful use of humor requires a mixture of both engaging content
build-up and an appropriate vocal delivery (e.g., pause). Prior studies on
computational humor emphasize the textual and audio features immediately next
to the punchline, yet overlooking longer-term context setup. Moreover, the
theories are usually too abstract for understanding each concrete humor
snippet. To fill in the gap, we develop DeHumor, a visual analytical system for
analyzing humorous behaviors in public speaking. To intuitively reveal the
building blocks of each concrete example, DeHumor decomposes each humorous
video into multimodal features and provides inline annotations of them on the
video script. In particular, to better capture the build-ups, we introduce
content repetition as a complement to features introduced in theories of
computational humor and visualize them in a context linking graph. To help
users locate the punchlines that have the desired features to learn, we
summarize the content (with keywords) and humor feature statistics on an
augmented time matrix. With case studies on stand-up comedy shows and TED
talks, we show that DeHumor is able to highlight various building blocks of

decoding algorithms to recover a sufficiently sparse vector or code from a
lower dimensional linear measurement vector. Typically it is assumed that the
decoder has access to the encoder matrix, which in the combinatorial case is
sparse and binary. In this paper we consider the problem of designing a decoder
to recover a set of sparse codes from their linear measurements alone, that is
without access to encoder matrix. To this end we study the matrix factorisation
task of recovering both the encoder and sparse coding matrices from the
associated linear measurement matrix. The contribution of this paper is a
computationally efficient decoding algorithm, Decoder-Expander Based
Factorisation, with strong performance guarantees. In particular, under mild
assumptions on the sparse coding matrix and by deploying a novel random encoder
matrix, we prove that Decoder-Expander Based Factorisation recovers both the
encoder and sparse coding matrix at the optimal measurement rate with high
probability and from a near optimal number of measurement vectors. In addition,
our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and computational efficiency of our

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study the problem of post-hoc calibration for multiclass classification,
with an emphasis on histogram binning. Multiple works have focused on
calibration with respect to the confidence of just the predicted class (or
'top-label'). We find that the popular notion of confidence calibration [Guo et
al., 2017] is not sufficiently strong -- there exist predictors that are not
calibrated in any meaningful way but are perfectly confidence calibrated. We
propose a closely related (but subtly different) notion, top-label calibration,
that accurately captures the intuition and simplicity of confidence
calibration, but addresses its drawbacks. We formalize a histogram binning (HB)
algorithm that reduces top-label multiclass calibration to the binary case,
prove that it has clean theoretical guarantees without distributional
assumptions, and perform a methodical study of its practical performance. Some
prediction tasks require stricter notions of multiclass calibration such as
class-wise or canonical calibration. We formalize appropriate HB algorithms
corresponding to each of these goals. In experiments with deep neural nets, we
find that our principled versions of HB are often better than temperature
scaling, for both top-label and class-wise calibration. Code for this work will
be made publicly available at https://github.com/aigen/df-posthoc-calibration.]]></summary>

economics, science and engineering. However, their numerical treatment poses
formidable challenges since traditional grid-based methods tend to be

trains provide an appealing approximation framework for parabolic PDEs: the
combination of reformulations in terms of backward stochastic differential
equations and regression-type methods in the tensor format holds the promise of
leveraging latent low-rank structures enabling both compression and efficient
computation. Following this paradigm, we develop novel iterative schemes,

cancer computer-aided diagnosis and surgical planning. However, both the
accuracy and robustness of existing liver segmentation methods cannot meet the
requirements of clinical applications. In particular, for the common clinical
cases where the liver tissue contains major pathology, current segmentation
methods show poor performance. In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank
tensor decomposition (LRTD) based multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) framework that
achieves accurate and robust pathological liver segmentation of CT images.
Firstly, we propose a multi-slice LRTD scheme to recover the underlying
low-rank structure embedded in 3D medical images. It performs the LRTD on small
image segments consisting of multiple consecutive image slices. Then, we
present an LRTD-based atlas construction method to generate tumor-free liver
atlases that mitigates the performance degradation of liver segmentation due to
the presence of tumors. Finally, we introduce an LRTD-based MAS algorithm to
derive patient-specific liver atlases for each test image, and to achieve
accurate pairwise image registration and label propagation. Extensive
experiments on three public databases of pathological liver cases validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Both qualitative and quantitative results
demonstrate that, in the presence of major pathology, the proposed method is
more accurate and robust than state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

everyday behaviors of individual organisms. Yet, most algorithms for
time-series modeling fail to learn dynamics of random event timings directly
from visual or audio inputs, requiring timing annotations during training that
are usually unavailable for real-world applications. For instance, neuroscience
perspectives on postdiction imply that there exist variable temporal ranges
within which the incoming sensory inputs can affect the earlier perception, but
such temporal ranges are mostly unannotated for real applications such as
automatic speech recognition (ASR). In this paper, we present a probabilistic
ordinary differential equation (ODE), called STochastic boundaRy ODE (STRODE),
that learns both the timings and the dynamics of time series data without
requiring any timing annotations during training. STRODE allows the usage of
differential equations to sample from the posterior point processes,
efficiently and analytically. We further provide theoretical guarantees on the
learning of STRODE. Our empirical results show that our approach successfully
infers event timings of time series data. Our method achieves competitive or
superior performances compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for both

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to recognize people's attitudes from
multiple communication channels such as verbal content (i.e., text), voice, and
facial expressions. It has become a vibrant and important research topic in
natural language processing. Much research focuses on modeling the complex
intra- and inter-modal interactions between different communication channels.
However, current multimodal models with strong performance are often
deep-learning-based techniques and work like black boxes. It is not clear how
models utilize multimodal information for sentiment predictions. Despite recent
advances in techniques for enhancing the explainability of machine learning
models, they often target unimodal scenarios (e.g., images, sentences), and
little research has been done on explaining multimodal models. In this paper,
we present an interactive visual analytics system, M2Lens, to visualize and
explain multimodal models for sentiment analysis. M2Lens provides explanations
on intra- and inter-modal interactions at the global, subset, and local levels.
Specifically, it summarizes the influence of three typical interaction types
(i.e., dominance, complement, and conflict) on the model predictions. Moreover,
M2Lens identifies frequent and influential multimodal features and supports the
multi-faceted exploration of model behaviors from language, acoustic, and
visual modalities. Through two case studies and expert interviews, we
demonstrate our system can help users gain deep insights into the multimodal
models for sentiment analysis.]]></summary>

machine learning model which is fair against every protected attribute (e.g.
both sex and race) at the same time. To solve this problem, we propose
FairBalance in this paper to balance the distribution of training data across
every protected attribute before training the machine learning models. Our
results show that, under the assumption of unbiased ground truth labels,
FairBalance can significantly reduce bias metrics (AOD, EOD, and SPD) on every

Mainstream FL approaches require each participant to share a common network

heterogeneous network architectures; and the data distribution is almost
certainly non-uniform across participants. To address these issues we introduce
FedH2L, which is agnostic to both the model architecture and robust to
different data distributions across participants. In contrast to approaches
sharing parameters or gradients, FedH2L relies on mutual distillation,
exchanging only posteriors on a shared seed set between participants in a
decentralized manner. This makes it extremely bandwidth efficient, model

past knowledge while being trained on new tasks. Common techniques to handle CF
include regularization of the weights (using, e.g., their importance on past
tasks), and rehearsal strategies, where the network is constantly re-trained on
past data. Generative models have also been applied for the latter, in order to
have endless sources of data. In this paper, we propose a novel method that
combines the strengths of regularization and generative-based rehearsal
approaches. Our generative model consists of a normalizing flow (NF), a
probabilistic and invertible neural network, trained on the internal embeddings
of the network. By keeping a single NF conditioned on the task, we show that
our memory overhead remains constant. In addition, exploiting the invertibility
of the NF, we propose a simple approach to regularize the network's embeddings
with respect to past tasks. We show that our method performs favorably with

research heavily relies on the labelled training data, which are time-costly
and labor-intensive to collect. To alleviate the critical dependency on the
training data in real-world applications, this study aims to improve
classification accuracy via data augmentation strategies. The effectiveness of
five data augmentation strategies under different training data inadequacy are
investigated in two scenarios: the noise-free scenario where different
availabilities of unlabelled data were considered, and the noisy scenario where
different levels of Gaussian noises and translational shifts were added to
represent sensor drifts. The five augmentation strategies, namely noise-adding
data augmentation, semi-supervised learning, classifier-based online learning,
Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) online learning and our novel ensemble ICP
online learning proposed in this study, are experimented and compared against
supervised learning baseline, with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and
Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the classifiers. Our novel strategy, ensemble
ICP online learning, outperforms the others by showing non-decreasing
classification accuracy on all tasks and a significant improvement on most
simulated tasks (25out of 36 tasks,p<=0.05). Furthermore, this study provides a
systematic analysis of different augmentation strategies. It shows at least one
strategy significantly improved the classification accuracy with LDA (p<=0.05)

particular, our proposed strategy demonstrated both effectiveness and
robustness in boosting the classification model generalizability, which can be

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Optimal transport (OT) distances are increasingly used as loss functions for
statistical inference, notably in the learning of generative models or
supervised learning. Yet, the behavior of minimum Wasserstein estimators is
poorly understood, notably in high-dimensional regimes or under model
misspecification. In this work we adopt the viewpoint of projection robust (PR)
OT, which seeks to maximize the OT cost between two measures by choosing a
$k$-dimensional subspace onto which they can be projected. Our first
contribution is to establish several fundamental statistical properties of PR
Wasserstein distances, complementing and improving previous literature that has
been restricted to one-dimensional and well-specified cases. Next, we propose
the integral PR Wasserstein (IPRW) distance as an alternative to the PRW
distance, by averaging rather than optimizing on subspaces. Our complexity
bounds can help explain why both PRW and IPRW distances outperform Wasserstein
distances empirically in high-dimensional inference tasks. Finally, we consider
parametric inference using the PRW distance. We provide an asymptotic guarantee
of two types of minimum PRW estimators and formulate a central limit theorem
for max-sliced Wasserstein estimator under model misspecification. To enable
our analysis on PRW with projection dimension larger than one, we devise a
novel combination of variational analysis and statistical theory.]]></summary>

(image recognition, decision-making, NLP, image synthesis), self-driving
technology has not yet followed the same trend. In this paper, we study the

stack. We argue that the slow progress is caused by approaches that require too
much hand-engineering, an over-reliance on road testing, and high fleet
deployment costs. We observe that the classical stack has several bottlenecks
that preclude the necessary scale needed to capture the long tail of rare
events. To resolve these problems, we outline the principles of Autonomy 2.0,
an ML-first approach to self-driving, as a viable alternative to the currently
adopted state-of-the-art. This approach is based on (i) a fully differentiable
AV stack trainable from human demonstrations, (ii) closed-loop data-driven
reactive simulation, and (iii) large-scale, low-cost data collections as
critical solutions towards scalability issues. We outline the general

modeling, machine learning and artificial intelligence. They allow us to
integrate in a natural way expert knowledge, physical modeling, heterogeneous
and correlated data and quantities of interest. For exactly this reason,
multiple sources of model uncertainty are inherent within the modular structure
of the graphical model. In this paper we develop information-theoretic, robust
uncertainty quantification methods and non-parametric stress tests for directed
graphical models to assess the effect and the propagation through the graph of
multi-sourced model uncertainties to quantities of interest. These methods
allow us to rank the different sources of uncertainty and correct the graphical
model by targeting its most impactful components with respect to the quantities
of interest. Thus, from a machine learning perspective, we provide a
mathematically rigorous approach to correctability that guarantees a systematic
selection for improvement of components of a graphical model while controlling
potential new errors created in the process in other parts of the model. We
demonstrate our methods in two physico-chemical examples, namely quantum
scale-informed chemical kinetics and materials screening to improve the
efficiency of fuel cells.]]></summary>

generating mind-blowing photorealistic images that mimic the content of
datasets they were trained to replicate. One recurrent theme in medical imaging
is whether GANs can also be effective at generating workable medical data as
they are for generating realistic RGB images. In this paper, we perform a
multi-GAN and multi-application study to gauge the benefits of GANs in medical
imaging. We tested various GAN architectures from basic DCGAN to more
sophisticated style-based GANs on three medical imaging modalities and organs
namely : cardiac cine-MRI, liver CT and RGB retina images. GANs were trained on
well-known and widely utilized datasets from which their FID score were
computed to measure the visual acuity of their generated images. We further
tested their usefulness by measuring the segmentation accuracy of a U-Net
trained on these generated images.

Results reveal that GANs are far from being equal as some are ill-suited for
medical imaging applications while others are much better off. The
top-performing GANs are capable of generating realistic-looking medical images
by FID standards that can fool trained experts in a visual Turing test and
comply to some metrics. However, segmentation results suggests that no GAN is
capable of reproducing the full richness of a medical datasets.]]></summary>

learning projects. Similar to lean startups and lean manufacturing, we argue
that lean machine learning (LeanML) can drastically slash avoidable wastes in
commercial machine learning projects, reduce the business risk in investing in
machine learning capabilities and, in so doing, further democratize access to
machine learning. The lean design pattern we propose in this paper is based on
two realizations. First, it is possible to estimate the best performance one
may achieve when predicting an outcome $y \in \mathcal{Y}$ using a given set of
explanatory variables $x \in \mathcal{X}$, for a wide range of performance
metrics, and without training any predictive model. Second, doing so is
considerably easier, faster, and cheaper than learning the best predictive
model. We derive formulae expressing the best $R^2$, MSE, classification
accuracy, and log-likelihood per observation achievable when using $x$ to
predict $y$ as a function of the mutual information $I\left(y; x\right)$, and
possibly a measure of the variability of $y$ (e.g. its Shannon entropy in the
case of classification accuracy, and its variance in the case regression MSE).
We illustrate the efficacy of the LeanML design pattern on a wide range of
regression and classification problems, synthetic and real-life.]]></summary>

(LTH) (Frankle & Carbin, 2018) pointed out that there could exist a winning
ticket (i.e., a properly pruned sub-network together with original weight
initialization) that can achieve competitive performance than the original
dense network. However, it is not easy to observe such winning property in many
scenarios, where for example, a relatively large learning rate is used even if
it benefits training the original dense model. In this work, we investigate the
underlying condition and rationale behind the winning property, and find that
the underlying reason is largely attributed to the correlation between
initialized weights and final-trained weights when the learning rate is not
sufficiently large. Thus, the existence of winning property is correlated with
an insufficient DNN pretraining, and is unlikely to occur for a well-trained
DNN. To overcome this limitation, we propose the "pruning & fine-tuning" method
that consistently outperforms lottery ticket sparse training under the same
pruning algorithm and the same total training epochs. Extensive experiments
over multiple deep models (VGG, ResNet, MobileNet-v2) on different datasets
have been conducted to justify our proposals.]]></summary>

their pace to use machine learning longitudinal motion planning (mMP) for
autonomous vehicles (AVs). This paper reviews the current state of the art in
mMP, with an exclusive focus on its impact on traffic congestion. We identify
the availability of congestion scenarios in current datasets, and summarize the
required features for training mMP. For learning methods, we survey the major
methods in both imitation learning and non-imitation learning. We also
highlight the emerging technologies adopted by some leading AV companies, e.g.
Tesla, Waymo, and Comma.ai. We find that: i) the AV industry has been mostly
focusing on the long tail problem related to safety and overlooked the impact
on traffic congestion, ii) the current public self-driving datasets have not
included enough congestion scenarios, and mostly lack the necessary input
features/output labels to train mMP, and iii) albeit reinforcement learning
(RL) approach can integrate congestion mitigation into the learning goal, the
major mMP method adopted by industry is still behavior cloning (BC), whose
capability to learn a congestion-mitigating mMP remains to be seen. Based on
the review, the study identifies the research gaps in current mMP development.
Some suggestions towards congestion mitigation for future mMP studies are
proposed: i) enrich data collection to facilitate the congestion learning, ii)
incorporate non-imitation learning methods to combine traffic efficiency into a
safety-oriented technical route, and iii) integrate domain knowledge from the
traditional car following (CF) theory to improve the string stability of mMP.]]></summary>

unanswered: what is the impact of these approaches on subsequent related tasks?
In this paper, the focus is put on facial expression recognition (FER), where
facial landmarks are used for face registration, which is a common usage. Since
the most used datasets for facial landmark localization do not allow for a
proper measurement of performance according to the different difficulties
(e.g., pose, expression, illumination, occlusion, motion blur), we also
quantify the performance of recent approaches in the presence of head pose
variations and facial expressions. Finally, a study of the impact of these
approaches on FER is conducted. We show that the landmark accuracy achieved so
far optimizing the conventional Euclidean distance does not necessarily
guarantee a gain in performance for FER. To deal with this issue, we propose a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using offline training schemes, researchers have tackled the event
segmentation problem by providing full or weak-supervision through manually
annotated labels or self-supervised epoch-based training. Most works consider
videos that are at most 10's of minutes long. We present a self-supervised
perceptual prediction framework capable of temporal event segmentation by
building stable representations of objects over time and demonstrate it on long
videos, spanning several days. The approach is deceptively simple but quite
effective. We rely on predictions of high-level features computed by a standard
deep learning backbone. For prediction, we use an LSTM, augmented with an
attention mechanism, trained in a self-supervised manner using the prediction
error. The self-learned attention maps effectively localize and track the
event-related objects in each frame. The proposed approach does not require
labels. It requires only a single pass through the video, with no separate
training set. Given the lack of datasets of very long videos, we demonstrate
our method on video from 10 days (254 hours) of continuous wildlife monitoring
data that we had collected with required permissions. We find that the approach
is robust to various environmental conditions such as day/night conditions,
rain, sharp shadows, and windy conditions. For the task of temporally locating
events, we had an 80% recall rate at 20% false-positive rate for frame-level
segmentation. At the activity level, we had an 80% activity recall rate for one
false activity detection every 50 minutes. We will make the dataset, which is
the first of its kind, and the code available to the research community.]]></summary>

the state-of-the-art model accuracy for various applications. However, the
enhanced accuracy comes at the cost of substantial memory bandwidth and storage
requirements and demanding computational resources. Although in the past the
quantization methods have effectively reduced the deployment cost for edge
devices, it suffers from significant information loss when processing the
biased activations of contemporary CNNs. In this paper, we hence introduce an
adaptive high-performance quantization method to resolve the issue of biased
activation by dynamically adjusting the scaling and shifting factors based on
the task loss. Our proposed method has been extensively evaluated on image
classification models (ResNet-18/34/50, MobileNet-V2, EfficientNet-B0) with
ImageNet dataset, object detection model (YOLO-V4) with COCO dataset, and
language models with PTB dataset. The results show that our 4-bit integer
(INT4) quantization models achieve better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
4-bit models, and in some cases, even surpass the golden full-precision models.
The final designs have been successfully deployed onto extremely
resource-constrained edge devices for many practical applications.]]></summary>

recent advanced deep learning-based models encourage the predicted results to
approximate the ground-truth masks with as large predictable areas as possible,
thus achieving the state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods do not
pay enough attention to small areas prone to misprediction. In this way, it is
still tough to accurately locate salient objects due to the existence of
regions with indistinguishable foreground and background and regions with
complex or fine structures. To address these problems, we propose a novel
convolutional neural network with purificatory mechanism and structural
similarity loss. Specifically, in order to better locate preliminary salient
objects, we first introduce the promotion attention, which is based on spatial
and channel attention mechanisms to promote attention to salient regions.
Subsequently, for the purpose of restoring the indistinguishable regions that
can be regarded as error-prone regions of one model, we propose the
rectification attention, which is learned from the areas of wrong prediction
and guide the network to focus on error-prone regions thus rectifying errors.
Through these two attentions, we use the Purificatory Mechanism to impose
strict weights with different regions of the whole salient objects and purify
results from hard-to-distinguish regions, thus accurately predicting the
locations and details of salient objects. In addition to paying different
attention to these hard-to-distinguish regions, we also consider the structural
constraints on complex regions and propose the Structural Similarity Loss. In
experiments, the proposed approach outperforms 19 state-of-the-art methods on
six datasets with a notable margin at over 27FPS on a single NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU.]]></summary>

challenging task in semantic image segmentation. Compact segmentation networks
are more widely used in the case of limited resources, while their performances
are constrained. In this paper, motivated by the residual learning and global
aggregation, we propose a simple yet general and effective knowledge
distillation framework called double similarity distillation (DSD) to improve
the classification accuracy of all existing compact networks by capturing the
similarity knowledge in pixel and category dimensions, respectively.
Specifically, we propose a pixel-wise similarity distillation (PSD) module that
utilizes residual attention maps to capture more detailed spatial dependencies
across multiple layers. Compared with exiting methods, the PSD module greatly
reduces the amount of calculation and is easy to expand. Furthermore,
considering the differences in characteristics between semantic segmentation
task and other computer vision tasks, we propose a category-wise similarity
distillation (CSD) module, which can help the compact segmentation network
strengthen the global category correlation by constructing the correlation
matrix. Combining these two modules, DSD framework has no extra parameters and
only a minimal increase in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on four challenging
datasets, including Cityscapes, CamVid, ADE20K, and Pascal VOC 2012, show that
DSD outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, proving its effectiveness and
generality. The code and models will be publicly available.]]></summary>

past knowledge while being trained on new tasks. Common techniques to handle CF
include regularization of the weights (using, e.g., their importance on past
tasks), and rehearsal strategies, where the network is constantly re-trained on
past data. Generative models have also been applied for the latter, in order to
have endless sources of data. In this paper, we propose a novel method that
combines the strengths of regularization and generative-based rehearsal
approaches. Our generative model consists of a normalizing flow (NF), a
probabilistic and invertible neural network, trained on the internal embeddings
of the network. By keeping a single NF conditioned on the task, we show that
our memory overhead remains constant. In addition, exploiting the invertibility
of the NF, we propose a simple approach to regularize the network's embeddings

damages, and uprooting communities, ecosystems and economies. Accurate and
robust flood detection including delineating open water flood areas and
identifying flood levels can aid in disaster response and mitigation. However,
estimating flood levels remotely is of essence as physical access to flooded
areas is limited and the ability to deploy instruments in potential flood zones
can be dangerous. Aligning flood extent mapping with local topography can
provide a plan-of-action that the disaster response team can consider. Thus,
remote flood level estimation via satellites like Sentinel-1 can prove to be
remedial. The Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence (ETCI)
competition on Flood Detection tasked participants with predicting flooded
pixels after training with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images in a
supervised setting. We use a cyclical approach involving two stages (1)
training an ensemble model of multiple UNet architectures with available high
and low confidence labeled data and, (2) generating pseudo labels or low
confidence labels on the unlabeled test dataset, and then, combining the
generated labels with the previously available high confidence labeled dataset.
This assimilated dataset is used for the next round of training ensemble
models. This cyclical process is repeated until the performance improvement
plateaus. Additionally, we post process our results with Conditional Random
Fields. Our approach sets a high score on the public leaderboard for the ETCI

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Designing off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms is typically a very
challenging task, because a desirable iteration update often involves an
expectation over an on-policy distribution. Prior off-policy actor-critic (AC)
algorithms have introduced a new critic that uses the density ratio for
adjusting the distribution mismatch in order to stabilize the convergence, but
at the cost of potentially introducing high biases due to the estimation errors
of both the density ratio and value function. In this paper, we develop a
doubly robust off-policy AC (DR-Off-PAC) for discounted MDP, which can take
advantage of learned nuisance functions to reduce estimation errors. Moreover,
DR-Off-PAC adopts a single timescale structure, in which both actor and critics
are updated simultaneously with constant stepsize, and is thus more sample
efficient than prior algorithms that adopt either two timescale or nested-loop
structure. We study the finite-time convergence rate and characterize the
sample complexity for DR-Off-PAC to attain an $\epsilon$-accurate optimal
policy. We also show that the overall convergence of DR-Off-PAC is doubly
robust to the approximation errors that depend only on the expressive power of
approximation functions. To the best of our knowledge, our study establishes
the first overall sample complexity analysis for a single time-scale off-policy
AC algorithm.]]></summary>

vision. Due to immense variability in scanners' parameters and imaging
protocols, even images obtained from the same person and the same scanner could
differ significantly. We address variability in computed tomography (CT) images
caused by different convolution kernels used in the reconstruction process, the
critical domain shift factor in CT. The choice of a convolution kernel affects
pixels' granularity, image smoothness, and noise level. We analyze a dataset of
paired CT images, where smooth and sharp images were reconstructed from the
same sinograms with different kernels, thus providing identical anatomy but
different style. Though identical predictions are desired, we show that the
consistency, measured as the average Dice between predictions on pairs, is just
0.54. We propose Filtered Back-Projection Augmentation (FBPAug), a simple and
surprisingly efficient approach to augment CT images in sinogram space
emulating reconstruction with different kernels. We apply the proposed method
in a zero-shot domain adaptation setup and show that the consistency boosts
from 0.54 to 0.92 outperforming other augmentation approaches. Neither specific

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An Axial Shifted MLP architecture (AS-MLP) is proposed in this paper.
Different from MLP-Mixer, where the global spatial feature is encoded for the
information flow through matrix transposition and one token-mixing MLP, we pay
more attention to the local features communication. By axially shifting
channels of the feature map, AS-MLP is able to obtain the information flow from
different axial directions, which captures the local dependencies. Such an
operation enables us to utilize a pure MLP architecture to achieve the same
local receptive field as CNN-like architecture. We can also design the
receptive field size and dilation of blocks of AS-MLP, etc, just like designing
those of convolution kernels. With the proposed AS-MLP architecture, our model
obtains 83.3% Top-1 accuracy with 88M parameters and 15.2 GFLOPs on the
ImageNet-1K dataset. Such a simple yet effective architecture outperforms all
MLP-based architectures and achieves competitive performance compared to the
transformer-based architectures (e.g., Swin Transformer) even with slightly
lower FLOPs. In addition, AS-MLP is also the first MLP-based architecture to be
applied to the downstream tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic
segmentation). The experimental results are also impressive. Our proposed
AS-MLP obtains 51.5 mAP on the COCO validation set and 49.5 MS mIoU on the
ADE20K dataset, which is competitive compared to the transformer-based
architectures. Code is available at https://github.com/svip-lab/AS-MLP.]]></summary>

functions have super-linearly growing and discontinuous stochastic gradients.
In such a setting, we provide a non-asymptotic analysis for the tamed

key paradigm in machine learning. Numerical experiments are presented for the
aforementioned example which supports our theoretical findings. Hence, in this
setting, we demonstrate both theoretically and numerically that the TUSLA
algorithm can solve the optimization problem involving neural networks with
ReLU activation function. Besides, we provide simulation results for synthetic
examples where popular algorithms, e.g. ADAM, AMSGrad, RMSProp, and (vanilla)

super-linear growth and the discontinuity of the corresponding stochastic

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sleep staging assumes an important role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
In general, experts classify sleep stages manually based on polysomnography
(PSG), which is quite time-consuming. Meanwhile, the acquisition of multiple
signals is complex, which can affect the subject's sleep. Therefore, the use of
single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) for automatic sleep staging has
become mainstream. In the literature, a large number of sleep staging methods
based on single-channel EEG have been proposed with good results and realize
the preliminary automation of sleep staging. However, the performance for most
of these methods in the N1 stage is generally not high. In this paper, we
propose a deep learning model SDAN based on raw EEG. The method utilises a
one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically extract
features from raw EEG. It serially combines the channel attention and spatial
attention mechanisms to filter and highlight key information and then uses soft
threshold to eliminate redundant information. Additionally, we introduce a
residual network to avoid degradation problems caused by network deepening.
Experiments were conducted using two datasets with 5-fold cross-validation and
hold-out validation method. The final average accuracy, overall accuracy, macro
F1 score and Cohen's Kappa coefficient of the model reach 96.74%, 91.86%,
82.64% and 0.8742 on the Sleep-EDF dataset, and 95.98%, 89.96%, 79.08% and
0.8216 on the Sleep-EDFx dataset. Significantly, our model performed superiorly
in the N1 stage, with F1 scores of 54.08% and 52.49% on the two datasets
respectively. The results show the superiority of our network over the best
existing methods, reaching a new state-of-the-art. In particular, the present
method achieves excellent results in the N1 sleep stage compared to other
methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most recent graph clustering methods have resorted to Graph Auto-Encoders
(GAEs) to perform joint clustering and embedding learning. However, two
critical issues have been overlooked. First, the accumulative error, inflicted
by learning with noisy clustering assignments, degrades the effectiveness and
robustness of the clustering model. This problem is called Feature Randomness.
Second, reconstructing the adjacency matrix sets the model to learn irrelevant
similarities for the clustering task. This problem is called Feature Drift.
Interestingly, the theoretical relation between the aforementioned problems has
not yet been investigated. We study these issues from two aspects: (1) the
existence of a trade-off between Feature Randomness and Feature Drift when
clustering and reconstruction are performed at the same level, and (2) the
problem of Feature Drift is more pronounced for GAE models, compared with
vanilla auto-encoder models, due to the graph convolutional operation and the
graph decoding design. Motivated by these findings, we reformulate the
GAE-based clustering methodology. Our solution is two-fold. First, we propose a
sampling operator $\Xi$ that triggers a protection mechanism against the noisy
clustering assignments. Second, we propose an operator $\Upsilon$ that triggers
a correction mechanism against Feature Drift by gradually transforming the
reconstructed graph into a clustering-oriented one. As principal advantages,
our solution grants a considerable improvement in clustering effectiveness and
robustness and can be easily tailored to existing GAE models.]]></summary>

(e.g., Uber or Lyft) have attracted much attention from both the academia and
the industry. In this paper, we consider an important dynamic car-hailing
problem, namely \textit{maximum revenue vehicle dispatching} (MRVD), in which
rider requests dynamically arrive and drivers need to serve as many riders as
possible such that the entire revenue of the platform is maximized. We prove
that the MRVD problem is NP-hard and intractable. In addition, the dynamic
car-hailing platforms have no information of the future riders, which makes the
problem even harder. To handle the MRVD problem, we propose a queueing-based
vehicle dispatching framework, which first uses existing machine learning
algorithms to predict the future vehicle demand of each region, then estimates
the idle time periods of drivers through a queueing model for each region. With
the information of the predicted vehicle demands and estimated idle time
periods of drivers, we propose two batch-based vehicle dispatching algorithms
to efficiently assign suitable drivers to riders such that the expected overall
revenue of the platform is maximized during each batch processing. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our

on-the-fly, power-efficient data processing, occurring as a wave propagates
through an artificially engineered medium. Yet, due to the fundamentally weak
non-linearities of traditional wave materials, such analog processors have been
so far largely confined to simple linear projections such as image edge

which inherently require strong non-linearities, have so far remained
out-of-reach of wave-based solutions, with a few attempts that implemented
non-linearities on the digital front, or used weak and inflexible non-linear
sensors, restraining the learning performance. Here, we tackle this issue by
demonstrating the relevance of Time-Floquet physics to induce a strong
non-linear entanglement between signal inputs at different frequencies,
enabling a power-efficient and versatile wave platform for analog extreme deep
learning involving a single, uniformly modulated dielectric layer and a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problem of labeled graph generation is gaining attention in the Deep
Learning community. The task is challenging due to the sparse and discrete
nature of graph spaces. Several approaches have been proposed in the
literature, most of which require to transform the graphs into sequences that
encode their structure and labels and to learn the distribution of such
sequences through an auto-regressive generative model. Among this family of
approaches, we focus on the GraphGen model. The preprocessing phase of GraphGen
transforms graphs into unique edge sequences called Depth-First Search (DFS)
codes, such that two isomorphic graphs are assigned the same DFS code. Each
element of a DFS code is associated with a graph edge: specifically, it is a
quintuple comprising one node identifier for each of the two endpoints, their
node labels, and the edge label. GraphGen learns to generate such sequences
auto-regressively and models the probability of each component of the quintuple
independently. While effective, the independence assumption made by the model
is too loose to capture the complex label dependencies of real-world graphs
precisely. By introducing a novel graph preprocessing approach, we are able to
process the labeling information of both nodes and edges jointly. The
corresponding model, which we term GraphGen-Redux, improves upon the generative
performances of GraphGen in a wide range of datasets of chemical and social
graphs. In addition, it uses approximately 78% fewer parameters than the
vanilla variant and requires 50% fewer epochs of training on average.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We extend the theory of PAC learning in a way which allows to model a rich
variety of learning tasks where the data satisfy special properties that ease
the learning process. For example, tasks where the distance of the data from
the decision boundary is bounded away from zero. The basic and simple idea is
to consider partial concepts: these are functions that can be undefined on
certain parts of the space. When learning a partial concept, we assume that the
source distribution is supported only on points where the partial concept is
defined.

This way, one can naturally express assumptions on the data such as lying on
a lower dimensional surface or margin conditions. In contrast, it is not at all
clear that such assumptions can be expressed by the traditional PAC theory. In
fact we exhibit easy-to-learn partial concept classes which provably cannot be
captured by the traditional PAC theory. This also resolves a question posed by
Attias, Kontorovich, and Mansour 2019.

We characterize PAC learnability of partial concept classes and reveal an
algorithmic landscape which is fundamentally different than the classical one.
For example, in the classical PAC model, learning boils down to Empirical Risk
Minimization (ERM). In stark contrast, we show that the ERM principle fails in
explaining learnability of partial concept classes. In fact, we demonstrate
classes that are incredibly easy to learn, but such that any algorithm that
learns them must use an hypothesis space with unbounded VC dimension. We also
find that the sample compression conjecture fails in this setting.

Thus, this theory features problems that cannot be represented nor solved in
the traditional way. We view this as evidence that it might provide insights on
the nature of learnability in realistic scenarios which the classical theory

propose a new sampling algorithm that converges to a global optimal solution
and suffers minimally from the curse of dimensionality. The algorithm consists
of two stages. First, we take samples following a sparse grid experimental
design and approximate the response surface via kernel ridge regression with a
Brownian field kernel. Second, we follow the expected improvement strategy --
with critical modifications that boost the algorithm's sample efficiency -- to
iteratively sample from the next level of the sparse grid. Under mild
conditions on the smoothness of the response surface and the simulation noise,
we establish upper bounds on the convergence rate for both noise-free and noisy
simulation samples. These upper rates deteriorate only slightly in the
dimension of the feasible set, and they can be improved if the objective
function is known be of a higher-order smoothness. Extensive numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm dramatically outperforms
typical alternatives in practice.]]></summary>

and can be an important backbone in reinforcement learning and planning.
However, existing approaches suffer in partially-observable environments due to
the lack of belief states. In this paper, we propose Structured World Belief, a
model for learning and inference of object-centric belief states. Inferred by
Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), our belief states provide multiple object-centric
scene hypotheses. To synergize the benefits of SMC particles with object
representations, we also propose a new object-centric dynamics model that
considers the inductive bias of object permanence. This enables tracking of
object states even when they are invisible for a long time. To further
facilitate object tracking in this regime, we allow our model to attend
flexibly to any spatial location in the image which was restricted in previous
models. In experiments, we show that object-centric belief provides a more

show the efficacy of structured world belief in improving the performance of

in machine learning. In this paper, we investigate the excess risk performance

for supervised learning, current theoretical understandings of ERM and SGD are
either have stronger assumptions in convex learning, e.g., strong convexity
condition, or show slow rates and less studied in nonconvex learning. Motivated
by these problems, we aim to provide improved rates under milder assumptions in
convex learning and derive faster rates in nonconvex learning. It is notable
that our analysis span two popular theoretical viewpoints: stability and
uniform convergence. To be specific, in stability regime, we present high
probability rates of order $\mathcal{O} (1/n)$ w.r.t. the sample size $n$ for
ERM and SGD with milder assumptions in convex learning and similar high
probability rates of order $\mathcal{O} (1/n)$ in nonconvex learning, rather
than in expectation. Furthermore, this type of learning rate is improved to
faster order $\mathcal{O} (1/n^2)$ in uniform convergence regime. To the best

model that can be trained end-to-end. Translatotron 2 consists of a speech

suggest that Translatotron 2 outperforms the original Translatotron by a large

drastically improves the robustness of the predicted speech by mitigating
over-generation, such as babbling or long pause. We also propose a new method
for retaining the source speaker's voice in the translated speech. The trained
model is restricted to retain the source speaker's voice, and unlike the
original Translatotron, it is not able to generate speech in a different
speaker's voice, making the model more robust for production deployment, by
mitigating potential misuse for creating spoofing audio artifacts. When the new

inference by introducing a series of topologies defined on general spaces of
structural causal models (SCMs). As an illustration of the framework we prove a
topological causal hierarchy theorem, showing that substantive assumption-free
causal inference is possible only in a meager set of SCMs. Thanks to a known
correspondence between open sets in the weak topology and statistically
verifiable hypotheses, our results show that inductive assumptions sufficient
to license valid causal inferences are statistically unverifiable in principle.
Similar to no-free-lunch theorems for statistical inference, the present
results clarify the inevitability of substantial assumptions for causal
inference. An additional benefit of our topological approach is that it easily
accommodates SCMs with infinitely many variables. We finally suggest that the
framework may be helpful for the positive project of exploring and assessing
alternative causal-inductive assumptions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data quality is a common problem in machine learning, especially in
high-stakes settings such as healthcare. Missing data affects accuracy,
calibration, and feature attribution in complex patterns. Developers often
train models on carefully curated datasets to minimize missing data bias;
however, this reduces the usability of such models in production environments,
such as real-time healthcare records. Making machine learning models robust to
missing data is therefore crucial for practical application. While some
classifiers naturally handle missing data, others, such as deep neural
networks, are not designed for unknown values. We propose a novel neural
network modification to mitigate the impacts of missing data. The approach is
inspired by neuromodulation that is performed by biological neural networks.
Our proposal replaces the fixed weights of a fully-connected layer with a
function of an additional input (reliability score) at each input, mimicking
the ability of cortex to up- and down-weight inputs based on the presence of
other data. The modulation function is jointly learned with the main task using
a multi-layer perceptron. We tested our modulating fully connected layer on
multiple classification, regression, and imputation problems, and it either
improved performance or generated comparable performance to conventional neural
network architectures concatenating reliability to the inputs. Models with
modulating layers were more robust against degradation of data quality by
introducing additional missingness at evaluation time. These results suggest
that explicitly accounting for reduced information quality with a modulating
fully connected layer can enable the deployment of artificial intelligence
systems in real-time settings.]]></summary>

learning. Second, based on the theoretical model, we introduce D-MUX: a
deceptive multiplexer-based logic-locking scheme that is resilient against

uncover a major fallacy in existing multiplexer-based locking schemes in the

for generating synthesized data similar to real data by jointly training a
generator and a discriminator. In many applications, data and computational
resources are distributed over many devices, so centralized computation with
all data in one location is infeasible due to privacy and/or communication
constraints. This paper proposes a new framework for training GANs in a
distributed fashion: Each device computes a local discriminator using local
data; a single server aggregates their results and computes a global GAN.
Specifically, in each iteration, the server sends the global GAN to the
devices, which then update their local discriminators; the devices send their
results to the server, which then computes their average as the global
discriminator and updates the global generator accordingly. Two different
update schedules are designed with different levels of parallelism between the
devices and the server. Numerical results obtained using three popular datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework can outperform a state-of-the-art
framework in terms of convergence speed.]]></summary>

costs of cloud-data services. At the same time, it is incredibly hard for users
to allocate resources per query in serverless processing systems, and they
frequently misallocate by orders of magnitude. Unfortunately, prior work
focused on predicting peak allocation while ignoring aggressive trade-offs
between resource allocation and run-time. Additionally, these methods fail to
predict allocation for queries that have not been observed in the past. In this
paper, we tackle both these problems. We introduce a system for optimal
resource allocation that can predict performance with aggressive trade-offs,
for both new and past observed queries. We introduce the notion of a
performance characteristic curve (PCC) as a parameterized representation that
can compactly capture the relationship between resources and performance. To
tackle training data sparsity, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique
to efficiently synthesize the entire PCC using a single run of the query.
Lastly, we demonstrate the advantages of a constrained loss function coupled
with GNNs, over traditional ML methods, for capturing the domain specific
behavior through an extensive experimental evaluation over SCOPE big data

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[High-quality labels are expensive to obtain for many machine learning tasks,
such as medical image classification tasks. Therefore, probabilistic (weak)
labels produced by weak supervision tools are used to seed a process in which
influential samples with weak labels are identified and cleaned by several
human annotators to improve the model performance. To lower the overall cost
and computational overhead of this process, we propose a solution called
Chef(CHEap and Fast label cleaning), which consists of the following three
components. First, to reduce the cost of human annotators, we use Infl, which
prioritizes the most influential training samples for cleaning and provides
cleaned labels to save the cost of one human annotator. Second, to accelerate
the sample selector phase and the model constructor phase, we use Increm-Infl
to incrementally produce influential samples, and DeltaGrad-L to incrementally
update the model. Third, we redesign the typical label cleaning pipeline so
that human annotators iteratively clean smaller batch of samples rather than
one big batch of samples. This yields better over all model performance and
enables possible early termination when the expected model performance has been
achieved. Extensive experiments show that our approach gives good model
prediction performance while achieving significant speed-ups.]]></summary>

tool in designing and controlling the nonlinear system. There exist different
entropy measures in the literature to analyze the predictability and complexity
of time series. However, these measures have some drawbacks especially in short
time series. To overcome the difficulties, this paper proposes a new method for
estimating the entropy of a time series using the LogNNet 784:25:10 neural
network model. The LogNNet reservoir matrix consists of 19625 elements which is
filled with the time series elements. After that, the network is trained on
MNIST-10 dataset and the classification accuracy is calculated. The accuracy is
considered as the entropy measure and denoted by NNetEn. A more complex
transformation of the input information by the time series in the reservoir
leads to higher NNetEn values. Many practical time series data have less than
19625 elements. Some duplicating or stretching methods are investigated to
overcome this difficulty and the most successful method is identified for
practical applications. The epochs number in the training process of LogNNet is
considered as the input parameter. A new time series characteristic called time
series learning inertia is introduced to investigate the effect of epochs
number in the efficiency of neural network. To show the robustness and
efficiency of the proposed method, it is applied on some chaotic, periodic,
random, binary and constant time series. The NNetEn is compared with some
existing entropy measures. The results show that the proposed method is more
robust and accurate than existing methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adaptive gradient methods, especially Adam-type methods (such as Adam,
AMSGrad, and AdaBound), have been proposed to speed up the training process
with an element-wise scaling term on learning rates. However, they often
generalize poorly compared with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its
accelerated schemes such as SGD with momentum (SGDM). In this paper, we propose
a new adaptive method called DecGD, which simultaneously achieves good
generalization like SGDM and obtain rapid convergence like Adam-type methods.
In particular, DecGD decomposes the current gradient into the product of two
terms including a surrogate gradient and a loss based vector. Our method
adjusts the learning rates adaptively according to the current loss based
vector instead of the squared gradients used in Adam-type methods. The
intuition for adaptive learning rates of DecGD is that a good optimizer, in
general cases, needs to decrease the learning rates as the loss decreases,
which is similar to the learning rates decay scheduling technique. Therefore,
DecGD gets a rapid convergence in the early phases of training and controls the
effective learning rates according to the loss based vectors which help lead to
a better generalization. Convergence analysis is discussed in both convex and
non-convex situations. Finally, empirical results on widely-used tasks and
models demonstrate that DecGD shows better generalization performance than SGDM
and rapid convergence like Adam-type methods.]]></summary>

outside the research field for several reasons that make them difficult to
integrate into a typical design process. In the early design phase, in

which requires quick iteration. This research introduces a novel method for
performance-driven geometry generation that can afford interaction directly in
the 3d modeling environment, eliminating the need for explicit parametrization,
and is multiple orders faster than the equivalent form optimization. The method
uses Machine Learning techniques to train a generative model offline. The
generative model learns a distribution of optimal performing geometries and
their simulation contexts based on a dataset that addresses the performance(s)
of interest. By navigating the generative model's latent space, geometries with
the desired characteristics can be quickly generated. A case study is
presented, demonstrating the generation of a synthetic dataset and the use of a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a generative model for geometries with optimal
solar gain. The results show that the VAE-generated geometries perform on

the state-of-the-art model accuracy for various applications. However, the
enhanced accuracy comes at the cost of substantial memory bandwidth and storage
requirements and demanding computational resources. Although in the past the
quantization methods have effectively reduced the deployment cost for edge
devices, it suffers from significant information loss when processing the
biased activations of contemporary CNNs. In this paper, we hence introduce an
adaptive high-performance quantization method to resolve the issue of biased
activation by dynamically adjusting the scaling and shifting factors based on
the task loss. Our proposed method has been extensively evaluated on image
classification models (ResNet-18/34/50, MobileNet-V2, EfficientNet-B0) with
ImageNet dataset, object detection model (YOLO-V4) with COCO dataset, and
language models with PTB dataset. The results show that our 4-bit integer
(INT4) quantization models achieve better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
4-bit models, and in some cases, even surpass the golden full-precision models.
The final designs have been successfully deployed onto extremely

future states of a running business process. However, the internal mechanisms
of many existing predictive algorithms are opaque and a human decision-maker is
unable to understand \emph{why} a certain activity was predicted. Recently,
counterfactuals have been proposed in the literature to derive
human-understandable explanations from predictive models. Current
counterfactual approaches consist of finding the minimum feature change that
can make a certain prediction flip its outcome. Although many algorithms have
been proposed, their application to the sequence and multi-dimensional data
like event logs has not been explored in the literature.

In this paper, we explore the use of a recent, popular model-agnostic
counterfactual algorithm, DiCE, in the context of predictive process analytics.
The analysis reveals that the algorithm is limited when being applied to derive
explanations of process predictions, due to (1) process domain knowledge not
being taken into account, (2) long traces that often tend to be less
understandable, and (3) difficulties in optimising the counterfactual search
with categorical variables. We design an extension of DiCE that can generate
counterfactuals for process predictions, and propose an approach that supports
deriving milestone-aware counterfactuals at different stages of a trace to
promote interpretability. We apply our approach to BPIC2012 event log and the
analysis results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing board games is considered a major challenge for both humans and AI
researchers. Because some complicated board games are quite hard to learn,
humans usually begin with playing on smaller boards and incrementally advance
to master larger board strategies. Most neural network frameworks that are
currently tasked with playing board games neither perform such incremental
learning nor possess capabilities to automatically scale up. In this work, we
look at the board as a graph and combine a graph neural network architecture
inside the AlphaZero framework, along with some other innovative improvements.
Our ScalableAlphaZero is capable of learning to play incrementally on small
boards, and advancing to play on large ones. Our model can be trained quickly
to play different challenging board games on multiple board sizes, without
using any domain knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
ScalableAlphaZero and show, for example, that by training it for only three
days on small Othello boards, it can defeat the AlphaZero model on a large
board, which was trained to play the large board for $30$ days.]]></summary>

for ranking and revenue improvement. Industrial ensemble models are typically
deep neural networks, following the supervised learning paradigm to infer
conversion rate given inputs from sub-models. However, this process has the
following two problems. Firstly, the point-wise scoring approach disregards the
relationships between items and leads to homogeneous displayed results, while
diversified display benefits user experience and revenue. Secondly, the
learning paradigm focuses on the ranking metrics and does not directly optimize
the revenue. In our work, we propose a new Learning-To-Ensemble (LTE) framework
RAEGO, which replaces the ensemble model with a contextual Rank Aggregator (RA)
and explores the best weights of sub-models by the Evaluator-Generator
Optimization (EGO). To achieve the best online performance, we propose a new
rank aggregation algorithm TournamentGreedy as a refinement of classic rank
aggregators, which also produces the best average weighted Kendall Tau Distance
(KTD) amongst all the considered algorithms with quadratic time complexity.
Under the assumption that the best output list should be Pareto Optimal on the
KTD metric for sub-models, we show that our RA algorithm has higher efficiency
and coverage in exploring the optimal weights. Combined with the idea of
Bayesian Optimization and gradient descent, we solve the online contextual
Black-Box Optimization task that finds the optimal weights for sub-models given
a chosen RA model. RA-EGO has been deployed in our online system and has
improved the revenue significantly.]]></summary>

systems such as online advertising, for which contextual bandit algorithms have
been proposed. Bayesian approaches provide guided exploration with principled
uncertainty estimation, but the applicability is often limited due to
over-simplified assumptions. Non-Bayesian bootstrap methods, on the other hand,
can apply to complex problems by using deep reward models, but lacks clear
guidance to the exploration behavior. It still remains largely unsolved to
develop a practical method for complex deep contextual bandits.

In this paper, we introduce Guided Bootstrap (GuideBoot for short), combining
the best of both worlds. GuideBoot provides explicit guidance to the
exploration behavior by training multiple models over both real samples and
noisy samples with fake labels, where the noise is added according to the
predictive uncertainty. The proposed method is efficient as it can make
decisions on-the-fly by utilizing only one randomly chosen model, but is also
effective as we show that it can be viewed as a non-Bayesian approximation of
Thompson sampling. Moreover, we extend it to an online version that can learn
solely from streaming data, which is favored in real applications. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic task and large-scale advertising environments
show that GuideBoot achieves significant improvements against previous
state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

problems over a given time horizon to construct a tight enclosure (Tube) of the
set of all process executions starting from a ball of initial states. We call
our algorithm GoTube. Through its construction, GoTube ensures that the
bounding tube is conservative up to a desired probability. GoTube is
implemented in JAX and optimized to scale to complex continuous-depth models.
Compared to advanced reachability analysis tools for time-continuous neural
networks, GoTube provably does not accumulate over-approximation errors between
time steps and avoids the infamous wrapping effect inherent in symbolic
techniques. We show that GoTube substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
verification tools in terms of the size of the initial ball, speed,

architectural design team during the early design phase. However, architects
and engineers do not typically work together during the conceptual phase; in
fact, structural engineers are often called late into the process. As a result,
updates in the design are more difficult and time-consuming to complete. At the
same time, there is a lost opportunity for better design exploration guided by
structural feedback. In general, the earlier in the design process the
iteration happens, the greater the benefits in cost efficiency and informed
de-sign exploration, which can lead to higher-quality creative results. In
order to facilitate an informed exploration in the early design stage, we
suggest the automation of fundamental structural engineering tasks and
introduce ApproxiFramer, a Machine Learning-based system for the automatic
generation of structural layouts from building plan sketches in real-time. The
system aims to assist architects by presenting them with feasible structural
solutions during the conceptual phase so that they proceed with their design
with adequate knowledge of its structural implications. In this paper, we
describe the system and evaluate the performance of a proof-of-concept
implementation in the domain of orthogonal, metal, rigid structures. We trained
a Convolutional Neural Net to iteratively generate structural design solutions
for sketch-level building plans using a synthetic dataset and achieved an

important gap by leveraging recent development in Bayesian deep learning and
privacy accounting to offer a more precise analysis of the trade-off between
privacy and accuracy in BNN. We propose three DP-BNNs that characterize the
weight uncertainty for the same network architecture in distinct ways, namely
DP-SGLD (via the noisy gradient method), DP-BBP (via changing the parameters of
interest) and DP-MC Dropout (via the model architecture). Interestingly, we
show a new equivalence between DP-SGD and DP-SGLD, implying that some
non-Bayesian DP training naturally allows for uncertainty quantification.
However, the hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size, can have
different or even opposite effects in DP-SGD and DP-SGLD.

Extensive experiments are conducted to compare DP-BNNs, in terms of privacy
guarantee, prediction accuracy, uncertainty quantification, calibration,
computation speed, and generalizability to network architecture. As a result,
we observe a new tradeoff between the privacy and the reliability. When
compared to non-DP and non-Bayesian approaches, DP-SGLD is remarkably accurate

Bayesian machine learning applications. Often, this requires to meaningfully
attribute predictive uncertainties to source features in an image, text or
categorical array. However, popular attribution methods are particularly
designed for classification and regression scores. In order to explain
uncertainties, state of the art alternatives commonly procure counterfactual
feature vectors, and proceed by making direct comparisons. In this paper, we
leverage path integrals to attribute uncertainties in Bayesian differentiable
models. We present a novel algorithm that relies on in-distribution curves
connecting a feature vector to some counterfactual counterpart, and we retain
desirable properties of interpretability methods. We validate our approach on
benchmark image data sets with varying resolution, and show that it
significantly simplifies interpretability over the existing alternatives.]]></summary>

the instance-level local discrimination of the given unlabeled images by
exploring various negative data. However, the existed sample outliers which
exhibit large intra-class divergences or small inter-class variations severely
limit their learning performance. We justify that the performance limitation is
caused by the gradient vanishing on these sample outliers. Moreover, the
shortage of positive data and disregard for global discrimination consideration
also pose critical issues for unsupervised learning but are always ignored by
existing methods. To handle these issues, we propose a novel solution to
explicitly model and directly explore the uncertainty of the given unlabeled
learning samples. Instead of learning a deterministic feature point for each
sample in the embedding space, we propose to represent a sample by a stochastic
Gaussian with the mean vector depicting its space localization and covariance
vector representing the sample uncertainty. We leverage such uncertainty
modeling as momentum to the learning which is helpful to tackle the outliers.
Furthermore, abundant positive candidates can be readily drawn from the learned
instance-specific distributions which are further adopted to mitigate the
aforementioned issues. Thorough rationale analyses and extensive experiments
are presented to verify our superiority.]]></summary>

restrictions on data availability. To still obtain viable models, continual
learning aims to train in sequential order, as and when data is available. The
main challenge that continual learning methods face is to prevent catastrophic
forgetting, i.e., a decrease in performance on the data encountered earlier.
This issue makes continuous training of segmentation models for medical
applications extremely difficult. Yet, often, data from at least two different
domains is available which we can exploit to train the model in a way that it
disregards domain-specific information. We propose an architecture that
leverages the simultaneous availability of two or more datasets to learn a
disentanglement between the content and domain in an adversarial fashion. The
domain-invariant content representation then lays the base for continual
semantic segmentation. Our approach takes inspiration from domain adaptation
and combines it with continual learning for hippocampal segmentation in brain
MRI. We showcase that our method reduces catastrophic forgetting and
outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods.]]></summary>

its malignancy, it is graded by a pathologist into three grades according to
WHO standards. This grade plays a decisive role in treatment, and yet may be
subject to inter-rater discordance. In this work, we present and compare three
approaches towards fully automatic meningioma grading from histology whole
slide images. All approaches are following a two-stage paradigm, where we first
identify a region of interest based on the detection of mitotic figures in the
slide using a state-of-the-art object detection deep learning network. This
region of highest mitotic rate is considered characteristic for biological
tumor behavior. In the second stage, we calculate a score corresponding to
tumor malignancy based on information contained in this region using three
different settings. In a first approach, image patches are sampled from this
region and regression is based on morphological features encoded by a
ResNet-based network. We compare this to learning a logistic regression from
the determined mitotic count, an approach which is easily traceable and
explainable. Lastly, we combine both approaches in a single network. We trained
the pipeline on 951 slides from 341 patients and evaluated them on a separate
set of 141 slides from 43 patients. All approaches yield a high correlation to
the WHO grade. The logistic regression and the combined approach had the best
results in our experiments, yielding correct predictions in 32 and 33 of all
cases, respectively, with the image-based approach only predicting 25 cases
correctly. Spearman's correlation was 0.716, 0.792 and 0.790 respectively. It
may seem counterintuitive at first that morphological features provided by
image patches do not improve model performance. Yet, this mirrors the criteria
of the grading scheme, where mitotic count is the only unequivocal parameter.]]></summary>

aerial images captured in different environments. Estimating the precise
transformation parameters is hindered by various environments such as time,

composed of a straight line owing to building and road. Therefore, the straight
lines are distorted when estimating homography parameters directly between two
images. In this paper, we propose a deep homography alignment network to
precisely match two aerial images by progressively estimating the various
transformation parameters. The proposed network is possible to train the
matching network with a higher degree of freedom by progressively analyzing the
transformation parameters. The precision matching performances have been
increased by applying homography transformation. In addition, we introduce a
method that can effectively learn the difficult-to-learn homography estimation
network. Since there is no published learning data for aerial image
registration, in this paper, a pair of images to which random homography
transformation is applied within a certain range is used for learning. Hence,
we could confirm that the deep homography alignment network shows high
precision matching performance compared with conventional works.]]></summary>

pixel-wise similarity learning to set-wise one to improve the robustness

resorting to attentional features of views, we establish corresponding sets,
thus filtering out noisy backgrounds that may cause incorrect correspondences.
Meanwhile, these attentional features can keep the coherence of the same image
across different views to alleviate semantic inconsistency. We further search
the cross-view nearest neighbours of sets and employ the structured
neighbourhood information to enhance the robustness. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that SetSim is superior to state-of-the-art methods on object

consume point clouds of fixed size directly. By analysis of PointNet, a pioneer
in introducing deep learning into point sets, we reveal that current
point-based methods are essentially spatial relationship processing networks.
In this paper, we take a different approach. Our architecture, named PE-Net,
learns the representation of point clouds in high-dimensional space, and
encodes the unordered input points to feature vectors, which standard 2D CNNs
can be applied to. The recommended network can adapt to changes in the number
of input points which is the limit of current methods. Experiments show that in
the tasks of classification and part segmentation, PE-Net achieves the

state-of-the-art results across a large scale range of models: For YOLO-Nano
with only 0.91M parameters and 1.08G FLOPs, we get 25.3% AP on COCO, surpassing
NanoDet by 1.8% AP; for YOLOv3, one of the most widely used detectors in
industry, we boost it to 47.3% AP on COCO, outperforming the current best

YOLOv4-CSP, YOLOv5-L, we achieve 50.0% AP on COCO at a speed of 68.9 FPS on
Tesla V100, exceeding YOLOv5-L by 1.8% AP. Further, we won the 1st Place on

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We propose an approach to instance segmentation from 3D point clouds based on
dynamic convolution. This enables it to adapt, at inference, to varying feature
and object scales. Doing so avoids some pitfalls of bottom up approaches,
including a dependence on hyper-parameter tuning and heuristic post-processing
pipelines to compensate for the inevitable variability in object sizes, even
within a single scene. The representation capability of the network is greatly
improved by gathering homogeneous points that have identical semantic
categories and close votes for the geometric centroids. Instances are then
decoded via several simple convolution layers, where the parameters are
generated conditioned on the input. The proposed approach is proposal-free, and
instead exploits a convolution process that adapts to the spatial and semantic
characteristics of each instance. A light-weight transformer, built on the
bottleneck layer, allows the model to capture long-range dependencies, with
limited computational overhead. The result is a simple, efficient, and robust
approach that yields strong performance on various datasets: ScanNetV2, S3DIS,
and PartNet. The consistent improvements on both voxel- and point-based
architectures imply the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As one of the prevalent components, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is widely
used in the current object detection models to improve the performance of
multi-scale detection. However, its interaction is still in a local and lossy
manner, thus limiting the representation power. In this paper, to simulate a
global view of human vision in object detection and address the inherent
defects of interaction mode in FPN, we construct a novel architecture termed
Content-Augmented Feature Pyramid Network (CA-FPN). Unlike the vanilla FPN,
which fuses features within a local receptive field, CA-FPN can adaptively
aggregate similar features from a global view. It is equipped with a global
content extraction module and light linear spatial transformers. The former
allows to extract multi-scale context information and the latter can deeply
combine the global content extraction module with the vanilla FPN using the
linearized attention function, which is designed to reduce model complexity.
Furthermore, CA-FPN can be readily plugged into existing FPN-based models.
Extensive experiments on the challenging COCO and PASCAL VOC object detection
datasets demonstrated that our CA-FPN significantly outperforms competitive
FPN-based detectors without bells and whistles. When plugging CA-FPN into
Cascade R-CNN framework built upon a standard ResNet-50 backbone, our method
can achieve 44.8 AP on COCO mini-val. Its performance surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art by 1.5 AP, demonstrating the potentiality of application.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guided depth super-resolution is a practical task where a low-resolution and
noisy input depth map is restored to a high-resolution version, with the help
of a high-resolution RGB guide image. Existing methods usually view this task
as a generalized guided filtering problem that relies on designing explicit
filters and objective functions, or a dense regression problem that directly
predicts the target image via deep neural networks. These methods suffer from
either model capability or interpretability. Inspired by the recent progress in
implicit neural representation, we propose to formulate the guided
super-resolution as a neural implicit image interpolation problem, where we
take the form of a general image interpolation but use a novel Joint Implicit
Image Function (JIIF) representation to learn both the interpolation weights
and values. JIIF represents the target image domain with spatially distributed
local latent codes extracted from the input image and the guide image, and uses
a graph attention mechanism to learn the interpolation weights at the same time
in one unified deep implicit function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
JIIF representation on guided depth super-resolution task, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art methods on three public benchmarks. Code can be

on unseen target domains with different statistics, is a challenging problem.
While many approaches have been proposed to solve this problem, they only
utilize source data during training but do not take advantage of the fact that
a single target example is available at the time of inference. Motivated by
this, we propose a method that effectively uses the target sample during
inference beyond mere classification. Our method has three components - (i) A
label-preserving feature or metric transformation on source data such that the
source samples are clustered in accordance with their class irrespective of
their domain (ii) A generative model trained on the these features (iii) A
label-preserving projection of the target point on the source-feature manifold
during inference via solving an optimization problem on the input space of the
generative model using the learned metric. Finally, the projected target is
used in the classifier. Since the projected target feature comes from the
source manifold and has the same label as the real target by design, the
classifier is expected to perform better on it than the true target. We
demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art Domain
Generalization methods on multiple datasets and tasks.]]></summary>

ideally from several sources. However, these datasets cannot be combined easily
because of patient privacy concerns or regulatory hurdles, especially if
medical data is involved. Federated learning (FL) is a way to train machine
learning models without the need for centralized datasets. Each FL client
trains on their local data while only sharing model parameters with a global
server that aggregates the parameters from all clients. At the same time, each
client's data can exhibit differences and inconsistencies due to the local
variation in the patient population, imaging equipment, and acquisition
protocols. Hence, the federated learned models should be able to adapt to the
local particularities of a client's data. In this work, we combine FL with an
AutoML technique based on local neural architecture search by training a
"supernet". Furthermore, we propose an adaptation scheme to allow for
personalized model architectures at each FL client's site. The proposed method
is evaluated on four different datasets from 3D prostate MRI and shown to
improve the local models' performance after adaptation through selecting an
optimal path through the AutoML supernet.]]></summary>

summary of disease-related information about patients. Such coding is usually
done manually in hospitals but could potentially be automated to improve the
efficiency and accuracy of medical coding. Recent studies on deep learning for
automated medical coding achieved promising performances. However, the
explainability of these models is usually poor, preventing them to be used
confidently in supporting clinical practice. Another limitation is that these
models mostly assume independence among labels, ignoring the complex
correlation among medical codes which can potentially be exploited to improve
the performance. We propose a Hierarchical Label-wise Attention Network (HLAN),
which aimed to interpret the model by quantifying importance (as attention
weights) of words and sentences related to each of the labels. Secondly, we
propose to enhance the major deep learning models with a label embedding (LE)
initialisation approach, which learns a dense, continuous vector representation
and then injects the representation into the final layers and the label-wise
attention layers in the models. We evaluated the methods using three settings
on the MIMIC-III discharge summaries: full codes, top-50 codes, and the UK NHS
COVID-19 shielding codes. Experiments were conducted to compare HLAN and LE
initialisation to the state-of-the-art neural network based methods. HLAN
achieved the best Micro-level AUC and $F_1$ on the top-50 code prediction and
comparable results on the NHS COVID-19 shielding code prediction to other
models. By highlighting the most salient words and sentences for each label,
HLAN showed more meaningful and comprehensive model interpretation compared to
its downgraded baselines and the CNN-based models. LE initialisation
consistently boosted most deep learning models for automated medical coding.]]></summary>

timepoint scans acquired upon disease presentation or admission. We present a
deep learning-based approach to predict lung infiltrate progression from serial
chest radiographs (CXRs) of COVID-19 patients. Our method first utilizes
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from patches within
the concerned lung zone, and also from neighboring and remote boundary regions.
The framework further incorporates a multi-scale Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
with a correlation module for effective predictions. The GRU accepts CNN
feature vectors from three different areas as input and generates a fused
representation. The correlation module attempts to minimize the correlation
loss between hidden representations of concerned and neighboring area feature
vectors, while maximizing the loss between the same from concerned and remote
regions. Further, we employ an attention module over the output hidden states
of each encoder timepoint to generate a context vector. This vector is used as
an input to a decoder module to predict patch severity grades at a future
timepoint. Finally, we ensemble the patch classification scores to calculate
patient-wise grades. Specifically, our framework predicts zone-wise disease
severity for a patient on a given day by learning representations from the
previous temporal CXRs. Our novel multi-institutional dataset comprises
sequential CXR scans from N=93 patients. Our approach outperforms transfer

data and obtain products with multiple data advantages. To solves the problem
of reduced resolution of PolSAR images due to system limitations, we propose a
fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images and
single-polarization synthetic aperture radar SAR (SinSAR) images fusion network
to generate high-resolution PolSAR (HR-PolSAR) images. To take advantage of the
polarimetric information of the low-resolution PolSAR (LR-PolSAR) image and the
spatial information of the high-resolution single-polarization SAR (HR-SinSAR)
image, we propose a fusion framework for joint LR-PolSAR image and HR-SinSAR
image and design a cross-attention mechanism to extract features from the joint
input data. Besides, based on the physical imaging mechanism, we designed the
PolSAR polarimetric loss function for constrained network training. The
experimental results confirm the superiority of fusion network over traditional
algorithms. The average PSNR is increased by more than 3.6db, and the average
MAE is reduced to less than 0.07. Experiments on polarimetric decomposition and
polarimetric signature show that it maintains polarimetric information well.]]></summary>

aims at localizing temporal intervals containing human actions in untrimmed

definition that a human, known as an agent, interacts with the environment and
performs an action that affects the environment, we propose a contextual
Agent-Environment Network. Our proposed contextual AEN involves (i) agent
pathway, operating at a local level to tell about which humans/agents are
acting and (ii) environment pathway operating at a global level to tell about
how the agents interact with the environment. Comprehensive evaluations on
20-action THUMOS-14 and 200-action ActivityNet-1.3 datasets with different

and machine learning. This is in part due to the increasing number of important
tasks such as meta-learning, clustering, and anomaly detection that are defined
on set inputs. These networks must take an arbitrary number of input samples
and produce the output invariant to the input set permutation. Several
algorithms have been recently developed to address this urgent need. Our paper
analyzes these algorithms using both synthetic and real-world datasets, and
shows that they are not effective in dealing with common data variations such
as image translation or viewpoint change. To address this limitation, we
propose a permutation-invariant cascaded attentional set operator (PICASO). The
gist of PICASO is a cascade of multihead attention blocks with dynamic
templates. The proposed operator is a stand-alone module that can be adapted
and extended to serve different machine learning tasks. We demonstrate the
utilities of PICASO in four diverse scenarios: (i) clustering, (ii) image
classification under novel viewpoints, (iii) image anomaly detection, and (iv)
state prediction. PICASO increases the SmallNORB image classification accuracy
with novel viewpoints by about 10% points. For set anomaly detection on CelebA
dataset, our model improves the areas under ROC and PR curves dataset by about
22% and 10%, respectively. For the state prediction on CLEVR dataset, it
improves the AP by about 40%.]]></summary>

techniques targeted for fisheye camera perception. Due to strong radial
distortion standard models don't generalize well to fisheye images and hence
the deformations in the visual appearance of objects and entities needs to be
encoded implicitly or as explicit knowledge. This challenge served as a medium
to investigate the challenges and new methodologies to handle the complexities
with perception on fisheye images. The challenge was hosted on CodaLab and used
the recently released WoodScape dataset comprising of 10k samples. In this
paper, we provide a summary of the competition which attracted the
participation of 71 global teams and a total of 395 submissions. The top teams
recorded significantly improved mean IoU and accuracy scores over the baseline

correctly infer the generative factors of variation in simple datasets
(dSprites, Shapes3D, MPI3D). In contrast to prior robustness work that
introduces novel factors of variation during test time, such as blur or other

existing factors of variation from the training data set (e.g., small and

that learn the correct mechanism should be able to generalize to this
benchmark. In total, we train and test 2000+ models and observe that all of
them struggle to learn the underlying mechanism regardless of supervision
signal and architectural bias. Moreover, the generalization capabilities of all
tested models drop significantly as we move from artificial datasets towards
more realistic real-world datasets. Despite their inability to identify the
correct mechanism, the models are quite modular as their ability to infer other

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) is to retrieve images of the same vehicle
across different cameras. Two key challenges lie in the subtle inter-instance
discrepancy caused by near-duplicate identities and the large intra-instance
variance caused by different views. Since the holistic appearance suffers from
viewpoint variation and distortion, part-level feature learning has been
introduced to enhance vehicle description. However, existing approaches to
localize and amplify significant parts often fail to handle spatial
misalignment as well as occlusion and require expensive annotations. In this
paper, we propose a weakly supervised Part-Mentored Attention Network (PMANet)
composed of a Part Attention Network (PANet) for vehicle part localization with
self-attention and a Part-Mentored Network (PMNet) for mentoring the global and
local feature aggregation. Firstly, PANet is introduced to predict a foreground
mask and pinpoint $K$ prominent vehicle parts only with weak identity
supervision. Secondly, we propose a PMNet to learn global and part-level
features with multi-scale attention and aggregate them in $K$ main-partial
tasks via part transfer. Like humans who first differentiate objects with
general information and then observe salient parts for more detailed clues,
PANet and PMNet construct a two-stage attention structure to perform a
coarse-to-fine search among identities. Finally, we address this Re-ID issue as
a multi-task problem, including global feature learning, identity
classification, and part transfer. We adopt Homoscedastic Uncertainty to learn
the optimal weighing of different losses. Comprehensive experiments are
conducted on two benchmark datasets. Our approach outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods by averagely 2.63% in CMC@1 on VehicleID and 2.2% in
mAP on VeRi776. Results on occluded test sets also demonstrate the
generalization ability of PMANet.]]></summary>

of region attention is an important factor, which has been explored a lot by
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based approaches. The recently developed
vision transformer (ViT) has achieved promising results on computer vision
tasks. Compared with CNNs, Image sequentialization is a brand new manner.
However, ViT is limited in its receptive field size and thus lacks local
attention like CNNs due to the fixed size of its patches, and is unable to
generate multi-scale features to learn discriminative region attention. To
facilitate the learning of discriminative region attention without box/part
annotations, we use the strength of the attention weights to measure the
importance of the patch tokens corresponding to the raw images. We propose the
recurrent attention multi-scale transformer (RAMS-Trans), which uses the
transformer's self-attention to recursively learn discriminative region
attention in a multi-scale manner. Specifically, at the core of our approach
lies the dynamic patch proposal module (DPPM) guided region amplification to
complete the integration of multi-scale image patches. The DPPM starts with the
full-size image patches and iteratively scales up the region attention to
generate new patches from global to local by the intensity of the attention
weights generated at each scale as an indicator. Our approach requires only the
attention weights that come with ViT itself and can be easily trained
end-to-end. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAMS-Trans performs better
than concurrent works, in addition to efficient CNN models, achieving
state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets.]]></summary>

networks have direct parallels in finite state machines, allowing clear
discussion and thought around architecture variants or trained models,
Transformers have no such familiar parallel. In this paper we aim to change
that, proposing a computational model for the transformer-encoder in the form
of a programming language. We map the basic components of a transformer-encoder
-- attention and feed-forward computation -- into simple primitives, around
which we form a programming language: the Restricted Access Sequence Processing
Language (RASP). We show how RASP can be used to program solutions to tasks
that could conceivably be learned by a Transformer, and how a Transformer can
be trained to mimic a RASP solution. In particular, we provide RASP programs
for histograms, sorting, and Dyck-languages. We further use our model to relate
their difficulty in terms of the number of required layers and attention heads:
analyzing a RASP program implies a maximum number of heads and layers necessary
to encode a task in a transformer. Finally, we see how insights gained from our
abstraction might be used to explain phenomena seen in recent works.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[End-to-end spoken language understanding (SLU) has recently attracted
increasing interest. Compared to the conventional tandem-based approach that
combines speech recognition and language understanding as separate modules, the
new approach extracts users' intentions directly from the speech signals,
resulting in joint optimization and low latency. Such an approach, however, is
typically designed to process one intention at a time, which leads users to
take multiple rounds to fulfill their requirements while interacting with a
dialogue system. In this paper, we propose a streaming end-to-end framework
that can process multiple intentions in an online and incremental way. The
backbone of our framework is a unidirectional RNN trained with the
connectionist temporal classification (CTC) criterion. By this design, an
intention can be identified when sufficient evidence has been accumulated, and
multiple intentions can be identified sequentially. We evaluate our solution on
the Fluent Speech Commands (FSC) dataset and the intent detection accuracy is
about 97 % on all multi-intent settings. This result is comparable to the
performance of the state-of-the-art non-streaming models, but is achieved in an
online and incremental way. We also employ our model to a keyword spotting task
using the Google Speech Commands dataset and the results are also highly
promising.]]></summary>

emerges from a requirement that the CNNs generate informative data. We propose
a technique to wug-test CNNs trained on speech and, based on four generative

its latent space. By manipulating only two categorical variables in the latent
space, we can actively turn an unreduplicated form into a reduplicated form
with no other substantial changes to the output in the majority of cases. We
also argue that the network extends the identity-based pattern to unobserved

emerge in CNNs and how the latent space variables outside of the training range
correlate with identity-based patterns in the output has general implications
for neural network interpretability.]]></summary>

recently. A fundamental question we'd like to address is: where did the
generated text come from? This work is our initial effort toward answering the
question by using prior art search. The purpose of the prior art search is to
find the most similar prior text in the training data of GPT-2. We take a
reranking approach and apply it to the patent domain. Specifically, we
pre-train GPT-2 models from scratch by using the patent data from the USPTO.
The input for the prior art search is the patent text generated by the GPT-2
model. We also pre-trained BERT models from scratch for converting patent text
to embeddings. The steps of reranking are: (1) search the most similar text in
the training data of GPT-2 by taking a bag-of-word ranking approach (BM25), (2)
convert the search results in text format to BERT embeddings, and (3) provide
the final result by ranking the BERT embeddings based on their similarities
with the patent text generated by GPT-2. The experiments in this work show that
such reranking is better than ranking with embeddings alone. However, our mixed
results also indicate that calculating the semantic similarities among long
text spans is still challenging. To our knowledge, this work is the first to
implement a reranking system to identify retrospectively the most similar
inputs to a GPT model based on its output.]]></summary>

level. The first challenge is solved with a splicing data method which
concatenates the speech segments extracted from the source domain data. To get
the time stamp, a phone prediction branch is added to the RNN-T model by
sharing the encoder for the purpose of force alignment. Finally, we obtain
word-level confidence scores by utilizing several types of features calculated
during decoding and from confusion network. Evaluated with Microsoft production
data, the splicing data adaptation method improves the baseline and adaptation
with the text to speech method by 58.03% and 15.25% relative word error rate

two independent physicians using a standardized approach. The multilayer
perceptron neural network outperforms other discriminative and generative

classification performance with 89 % accuracy, 88 % recall, and 89 % precision.
Furthermore, a generative autoencoder learning algorithm was proposed to

subtitles in multilingual events is more relevant than ever. In an attempt to
automatise the process, we aim at exploring the feasibility of simultaneous
speech translation (SimulST) for live subtitling. However, the word-for-word
rate of generation of SimulST systems is not optimal for displaying the
subtitles in a comprehensible and readable way. In this work, we adapt SimulST
systems to predict subtitle breaks along with the translation. We then propose
a display mode that exploits the predicted break structure by presenting the
subtitles in scrolling lines. We compare our proposed mode with a display 1)
word-for-word and 2) in blocks, in terms of reading speed and delay.
Experiments on three language pairs (en$\rightarrow$it, de, fr) show that
scrolling lines is the only mode achieving an acceptable reading speed while
keeping delay close to a 4-second threshold. We argue that simultaneous
translation for readable live subtitles still faces challenges, the main one
being poor translation quality, and propose directions for steering future
research.]]></summary>

multiple communication channels such as verbal content (i.e., text), voice, and
facial expressions. It has become a vibrant and important research topic in
natural language processing. Much research focuses on modeling the complex
intra- and inter-modal interactions between different communication channels.
However, current multimodal models with strong performance are often
deep-learning-based techniques and work like black boxes. It is not clear how
models utilize multimodal information for sentiment predictions. Despite recent
advances in techniques for enhancing the explainability of machine learning
models, they often target unimodal scenarios (e.g., images, sentences), and
little research has been done on explaining multimodal models. In this paper,
we present an interactive visual analytics system, M2Lens, to visualize and
explain multimodal models for sentiment analysis. M2Lens provides explanations
on intra- and inter-modal interactions at the global, subset, and local levels.
Specifically, it summarizes the influence of three typical interaction types
(i.e., dominance, complement, and conflict) on the model predictions. Moreover,
M2Lens identifies frequent and influential multimodal features and supports the
multi-faceted exploration of model behaviors from language, acoustic, and
visual modalities. Through two case studies and expert interviews, we
demonstrate our system can help users gain deep insights into the multimodal
models for sentiment analysis.]]></summary>

quantitative imaging method that involves a two-step process: (i)
reconstructing a series of time frames from highly-undersampled non-Cartesian
spiral k-space data and (ii) pattern matching using the time frames to infer
tissue properties (e.g., T1 and T2 relaxation times). In this paper, we
introduce a novel end-to-end deep learning framework to seamlessly map the
tissue properties directly from spiral k-space MRF data, thereby avoiding
time-consuming processing such as the nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT)
and the dictionary-based Fingerprint matching. Our method directly consumes the
non-Cartesian k- space data, performs adaptive density compensation, and
predicts multiple tissue property maps in one forward pass. Experiments on both
2D and 3D MRF data demonstrate that quantification accuracy comparable to
state-of-the-art methods can be accomplished within 0.5 second, which is 1100
to 7700 times faster than the original MRF framework. The proposed method is
thus promising for facilitating the adoption of MRF in clinical settings.]]></summary>

bidding system is becoming paramount for the success of e-commerce companies.
The critical challenges faced by a modern industrial-level bidding system
include: 1. the catalog is enormous, and the relevant bidding features are of
high sparsity; 2. the large volume of bidding requests induces significant
computation burden to both the offline and online serving. Leveraging
extraneous user-item information proves essential to mitigate the sparsity
issue, for which we exploit the natural language signals from the users' query
and the contextual knowledge from the products. In particular, we extract the
vector representations of ads via the Transformer model and leverage their
geometric relation to building collaborative bidding predictions via
clustering. The two-step procedure also significantly reduces the computation
stress of bid evaluation and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the
end-to-end structure of the bidding system for search engine marketing for
Walmart e-commerce, which successfully handles tens of millions of bids each
day. We analyze the online and offline performances of our approach and discuss
how we find it as a production-efficient solution.]]></summary>

image pair in an extreme setting, where the images have little or no overlap.
We observe that, even when images do not overlap, there may be rich hidden cues
as to their geometric relationship, such as light source directions, vanishing
points, and symmetries present in the scene. We propose a network design that
can automatically learn such implicit cues by comparing all pairs of points
between the two input images. Our method therefore constructs dense feature
correlation volumes and processes these to predict relative 3D rotations. Our
predictions are formed over a fine-grained discretization of rotations,
bypassing difficulties associated with regressing 3D rotations. We demonstrate
our approach on a large variety of extreme RGB image pairs, including indoor
and outdoor images captured under different lighting conditions and geographic
locations. Our evaluation shows that our model can successfully estimate
relative rotations among non-overlapping images without compromising
performance over overlapping image pairs.]]></summary>

train-loss hacking, which is a source of overfitting caused by a typical

novel self-supervised method to estimate this prior efficiently by combining a
Bayesian estimation framework and new stopping criteria. Our method iteratively
estimates appropriate class priors and yields high segmentation quality for a

culture, and day-to-day conversations by millions of ordinary people at a scale
that is scarcely conventionalized and recorded. Vitally, and absent from many
standard corpora such as books and news archives, sharing and commenting
mechanisms are native to social media platforms, enabling us to quantify social
amplification (i.e., popularity) of trending storylines and contemporary
cultural phenomena. Here, we describe Storywrangler, a natural language
processing instrument designed to carry out an ongoing, day-scale curation of
over 100 billion tweets containing roughly 1 trillion 1-grams from 2008 to
2021. For each day, we break tweets into unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams
spanning over 100 languages. We track n-gram usage frequencies, and generate
Zipf distributions, for words, hashtags, handles, numerals, symbols, and
emojis. We make the data set available through an interactive time series
viewer, and as downloadable time series and daily distributions. Although
Storywrangler leverages Twitter data, our method of extracting and tracking
dynamic changes of n-grams can be extended to any similar social media
platform. We showcase a few examples of the many possible avenues of study we
aim to enable including how social amplification can be visualized through
'contagiograms'. We also present some example case studies that bridge n-gram
time series with disparate data sources to explore sociotechnical dynamics of
famous individuals, box office success, and social unrest.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epistemic Planning (EP) refers to an automated planning setting where the
agent reasons in the space of knowledge states and tries to find a plan to
reach a desirable state from the current state. Its general form, the
Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) problem involves multiple agents who need
to reason about both the state of the world and the information flow between
agents. In a MEP problem, multiple approaches have been developed recently with
varying restrictions, such as considering only the concept of knowledge while
not allowing the idea of belief, or not allowing for ``complex" modal operators
such as those needed to handle dynamic common knowledge. While the diversity of
approaches has led to a deeper understanding of the problem space, the lack of
a standardized way to specify MEP problems independently of solution approaches
has created difficulties in comparing performance of planners, identifying
promising techniques, exploring new strategies like ensemble methods, and
making it easy for new researchers to contribute to this research area. To
address the situation, we propose a unified way of specifying EP problems - the
Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language, E-PDDL. We show that E-PPDL can
be supported by leading MEP planners and provide corresponding parser code that
translates EP problems specified in E-PDDL into (M)EP problems that can be
handled by several planners. This work is also useful in building more general
epistemic planning environments where we envision a meta-cognitive module that
takes a planning problem in E-PDDL, identifies and assesses some of its
features, and autonomously decides which planner is the best one to solve it.]]></summary>

Also, compiling a handcrafted and curated domain-specific knowledge base for

to automatically mine and leverage domain-specific knowledge for classifying
objects and attribute coreferences. The approach extracts domain-specific
knowledge from unlabeled review data and trains a knowledgeaware neural

well-studied task in natural language understanding (NLU). However, many of
these relationships are evident only at the level of the document, as a role

while accelerating learning progress on subsequent tasks. Specifically, TPEM
(i) leverages network pruning to keep the knowledge for old tasks, (ii) adopts
network expanding to create free weights for new tasks, and (iii) introduces
task-specific network masking to alleviate the negative impact of fixed weights
of old tasks on new tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on seven different

significantly improved results over the strong competitors. For

high-quality MRC models still requires large-scale labeled training data, even
using strong pre-trained language models (PLMs). The pre-training tasks for
PLMs are not question-answering or MRC-based tasks, making existing PLMs unable
to be directly used for unsupervised MRC. Specifically, MRC aims to spot an
accurate answer span from the given document, but PLMs focus on token filling
in sentences. In this paper, we propose a new framework for unsupervised MRC.
Firstly, we propose to learn to spot answer spans in documents via
self-supervised learning, by designing a self-supervision pretext task for MRC
- Spotting-MLM. Solving this task requires capturing deep interactions between
sentences in documents. Secondly, we apply a simple sentence rewriting strategy
in the inference stage to alleviate the expression mismatch between questions

-- a successful use of humor requires a mixture of both engaging content
build-up and an appropriate vocal delivery (e.g., pause). Prior studies on
computational humor emphasize the textual and audio features immediately next
to the punchline, yet overlooking longer-term context setup. Moreover, the
theories are usually too abstract for understanding each concrete humor
snippet. To fill in the gap, we develop DeHumor, a visual analytical system for
analyzing humorous behaviors in public speaking. To intuitively reveal the
building blocks of each concrete example, DeHumor decomposes each humorous
video into multimodal features and provides inline annotations of them on the
video script. In particular, to better capture the build-ups, we introduce
content repetition as a complement to features introduced in theories of
computational humor and visualize them in a context linking graph. To help
users locate the punchlines that have the desired features to learn, we
summarize the content (with keywords) and humor feature statistics on an
augmented time matrix. With case studies on stand-up comedy shows and TED
talks, we show that DeHumor is able to highlight various building blocks of
humor examples. In addition, expert interviews with communication coaches and
humor researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of DeHumor for multimodal humor
analysis of speech content and vocal delivery.]]></summary>

the reality we live. Each of these styles has its own set of subjective
properties, such as rhyme and rhythm, which are easily caught by a human
reader's eye and ear. With the recent advances in artificial intelligence, the
gap between humans and machines may have decreased, and today we observe
algorithms mastering tasks that were once exclusively performed by humans. In
this paper, we propose an automated method to distinguish between poetry and
prose based solely on aural and rhythmic properties. In other to compare prose
and poetry rhythms, we represent the rhymes and phones as temporal sequences
and thus we propose a procedure for extracting rhythmic features from these
sequences. The classification of the considered texts using the set of features
extracted resulted in a best accuracy of 0.78, obtained with a neural network.
Interestingly, by using an approach based on complex networks to visualize the
similarities between the different texts considered, we found that the patterns
of poetry vary much more than prose. Consequently, a much richer and complex
set of rhythmic possibilities tends to be found in that modality.]]></summary>

However, its resource-intensive nature makes it challenging to implement on
constrained embedded devices, particularly where available hardware resources
can vary at run-time. We propose a dynamic machine translation model that
scales the Transformer architecture based on the available resources at any
particular time. The proposed approach, 'Dynamic-HAT', uses a HAT
SuperTransformer as the backbone to search for SubTransformers with different
accuracy-latency trade-offs at design time. The optimal SubTransformers are
sampled from the SuperTransformer at run-time, depending on latency
constraints. The Dynamic-HAT is tested on the Jetson Nano and the approach uses
inherited SubTransformers sampled directly from the SuperTransformer with a
switching time of <1s. Using inherited SubTransformers results in a BLEU score
loss of <1.5% because the SubTransformer configuration is not retrained from
scratch after sampling. However, to recover this loss in performance, the
dimensions of the design space can be reduced to tailor it to a family of
target hardware. The new reduced design space results in a BLEU score increase
of approximately 1% for sub-optimal models from the original design space, with
a wide range for performance scaling between 0.356s - 1.526s for the GPU and

to generate noise-robust utterances, and similar solutions have been developed

(NMT) models with the pre-trained language models (LM) can speed up the model
training and boost the model performance. In this work, we identify a critical
side-effect of pre-training for NMT, which is due to the discrepancy between
the training objectives of LM-based pre-training and NMT. Since the LM
objective learns to reconstruct a few source tokens and copy most of them, the
pre-training initialization would affect the copying behaviors of NMT models.
We provide a quantitative analysis of copying behaviors by introducing a metric
called copying ratio, which empirically shows that pre-training based NMT
models have a larger copying ratio than the standard one. In response to this
problem, we propose a simple and effective method named copying penalty to
control the copying behaviors in decoding. Extensive experiments on both
in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks show that the copying penalty method
consistently improves translation performance by controlling copying behaviors
for pre-training based NMT models. Source code is freely available at

raw audio using a contrastive self-supervised signal. Whereas prior work has
relied on conditioning models on bottlenecks, we introduce a set of inductive
biases that exploit the natural structure of prosody to minimize timbral
information and decouple prosody from speaker representations. Despite
aggressive downsampling of the input and having no access to linguistic
information, our model performs comparably to state-of-the-art speech
representations on DAMMP, a new benchmark we introduce for spoken language
understanding. We use minimum description length probing to show that our
representations have selectively learned the subcomponents of non-timbral
prosody, and that the product quantizer naturally disentangles them without
using bottlenecks. We derive an information-theoretic definition of speech
de-identifiability and use it to demonstrate that our prosody representations
are less identifiable than other speech representations.]]></summary>

research takes cues from social science theories to develop a four dimensional
category for racism and xenophobia detection, namely stigmatization,
offensiveness, blame, and exclusion. With the aid of deep learning techniques,
this categorical detection enables insights into the nuances of emergent topics
reflected in racist and xenophobic expression on Twitter. Moreover, a stage
wise analysis is applied to capture the dynamic changes of the topics across
the stages of early development of Covid-19 from a domestic epidemic to an
international public health emergency, and later to a global pandemic. The main
contributions of this research include, first the methodological advancement.
By bridging the state-of-the-art computational methods with social science
perspective, this research provides a meaningful approach for future research
to gain insight into the underlying subtlety of racist and xenophobic
discussion on digital platforms. Second, by enabling a more accurate
comprehension and even prediction of public opinions and actions, this research
paves the way for the enactment of effective intervention policies to combat
racist crimes and social exclusion under Covid-19.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[High frame-corruption is widely observed in Long Range Wide Area Networks
(LoRaWAN) due to the coexistence with other networks in ISM bands and an
Aloha-like MAC layer. LoRa's Forward Error Correction (FEC) mechanism is often
insufficient to retrieve corrupted data. In fact, real-life measurements show
that at least one-fourth of received transmissions are corrupted. When more
frames are dropped, LoRa nodes usually switch over to higher spreading factors
(SF), thus increasing transmission times and increasing the required energy.
This paper introduces ReDCoS, a novel coding technique at the application layer
that improves recovery of corrupted LoRa frames, thus reducing the overall
transmission time and energy invested by LoRa nodes by several-fold. ReDCoS
utilizes lightweight coding techniques to pre-encode the transmitted data.
Therefore, the inbuilt Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) that follows is computed
based on an already encoded data. At the receiver, we use both the CRC and the
coded data to recover data from a corrupted frame beyond the built-in Error
Correcting Code (ECC). We compare the performance of ReDCoS to (I) the standard
FEC of vanilla-LoRaWAN, and to (ii) RS coding applied as ECC to the data of
LoRaWAN. The results indicated a 54x and 13.5x improvement of decoding ratio,
respectively, when 20 data symbols were sent. Furthermore, we evaluated ReDCoS
on-field using LoRa SX1261 transceivers showing that it outperformed RS-coding
by factor of at least 2x (and up to 6x) in terms of the decoding ratio while
consuming 38.5% less energy per correctly received transmission.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The exploration/exploitation (E&E) dilemma lies at the core of interactive
systems such as online advertising, for which contextual bandit algorithms have
been proposed. Bayesian approaches provide guided exploration with principled
uncertainty estimation, but the applicability is often limited due to
over-simplified assumptions. Non-Bayesian bootstrap methods, on the other hand,
can apply to complex problems by using deep reward models, but lacks clear
guidance to the exploration behavior. It still remains largely unsolved to
develop a practical method for complex deep contextual bandits.

In this paper, we introduce Guided Bootstrap (GuideBoot for short), combining
the best of both worlds. GuideBoot provides explicit guidance to the
exploration behavior by training multiple models over both real samples and
noisy samples with fake labels, where the noise is added according to the
predictive uncertainty. The proposed method is efficient as it can make
decisions on-the-fly by utilizing only one randomly chosen model, but is also
effective as we show that it can be viewed as a non-Bayesian approximation of
Thompson sampling. Moreover, we extend it to an online version that can learn
solely from streaming data, which is favored in real applications. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic task and large-scale advertising environments
show that GuideBoot achieves significant improvements against previous
state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

(DNNs), many existing DNN watermarking techniques either embed watermarks
directly into the DNN parameters or insert backdoor watermarks by fine-tuning
the DNN parameters, which, however, cannot resist against various attack
methods that remove watermarks by altering DNN parameters. In this paper, we
bypass such attacks by introducing a structural watermarking scheme that
utilizes channel pruning to embed the watermark into the host DNN architecture
instead of crafting the DNN parameters. To be specific, during watermark
embedding, we prune the internal channels of the host DNN with the channel
pruning rates controlled by the watermark. During watermark extraction, the
watermark is retrieved by identifying the channel pruning rates from the
architecture of the target DNN model. Due to the superiority of pruning
mechanism, the performance of the DNN model on its original task is reserved
during watermark embedding. Experimental results have shown that, the proposed
work enables the embedded watermark to be reliably recovered and provides a
high watermark capacity, without sacrificing the usability of the DNN model. It
is also demonstrated that the work is robust against common transforms and
attacks designed for conventional watermarking approaches.]]></summary>

not seen wide adoption for machine learning systems due to a lack of
computational interpretation. In this paper, we build on literature in machine
learning and law to propose the first learning framework for limiting data
collection based on an interpretation that ties the data collection purpose to
system performance. We formalize a data minimization criterion based on
performance curve derivatives and provide an effective and interpretable
piecewise power law technique that models distinct stages of an algorithm's
performance throughout data collection. Results from our empirical
investigation offer deeper insights into the relevant considerations when
designing a data minimization framework, including the choice of feature

Users visit these platforms and enter search queries to retrieve their desired
products. Therefore, showing the relevant products at the top is essential for
the success of e-commerce platforms. We approach this problem by learning low
dimension representations for queries and product descriptions by leveraging
user click-stream data as our main source of signal for product relevance.
Starting from GRU-based architectures as our baseline model, we move towards a
more advanced transformer-based architecture. This helps the model to learn
contextual representations of queries and products to serve better search
results and understand the user intent in an efficient manner. We perform
experiments related to pre-training of the Transformer based RoBERTa model
using a fashion corpus and fine-tuning it over the triplet loss. Our
experiments on the product ranking task show that the RoBERTa model is able to
give an improvement of 7.8% in Mean Reciprocal Rank(MRR), 15.8% in Mean Average
Precision(MAP) and 8.8% in Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain(NDCG), thus
outperforming our GRU based baselines. For the product retrieval task, RoBERTa
model is able to outperform other two models with an improvement of 164.7% in
Precision@50 and 145.3% in Recall@50. In order to highlight the importance of
pre-training RoBERTa for fashion domain, we qualitatively compare already
pre-trained RoBERTa on standard datasets with our custom pre-trained RoBERTa
over a fashion corpus for the query token prediction task. Finally, we also
show a qualitative comparison between GRU and RoBERTa results for product
retrieval task for some test queries.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Similar question retrieval is a core task in community-based question
answering (CQA) services. To balance the effectiveness and efficiency, the
question retrieval system is typically implemented as multi-stage rankers: The
first-stage ranker aims to recall potentially relevant questions from a large
repository, and the latter stages attempt to re-rank the retrieved results.
Most existing works on question retrieval mainly focused on the re-ranking
stages, leaving the first-stage ranker to some traditional term-based methods.
However, term-based methods often suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem,
especially on short texts, which may block the re-rankers from relevant
questions at the very beginning. An alternative is to employ embedding-based
methods for the first-stage ranker, which compress texts into dense vectors to
enhance the semantic matching. However, these methods often lose the
discriminative power as term-based methods, thus introduce noise during
retrieval and hurt the recall performance. In this work, we aim to tackle the
dilemma of the first-stage ranker, and propose a discriminative semantic
ranker, namely DenseTrans, for high-recall retrieval. Specifically, DenseTrans
is a densely connected Transformer, which learns semantic embeddings for texts
based on Transformer layers. Meanwhile, DenseTrans promotes low-level features
through dense connections to keep the discriminative power of the learned
representations. DenseTrans is inspired by DenseNet in computer vision (CV),
but poses a new way to use the dense connectivity which is totally different
from its original design purpose. Experimental results over two question
retrieval benchmark datasets show that our model can obtain significant gain on
recall against strong term-based methods as well as state-of-the-art
embedding-based methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we develop face.evoLVe -- a comprehensive library that
collects and implements a wide range of popular deep learning-based methods for
face recognition. First of all, face.evoLVe is composed of key components that
cover the full process of face analytics, including face alignment, data
processing, various backbones, losses, and alternatives with bags of tricks for
improving performance. Later, face.evoLVe supports multi-GPU training on top of
different deep learning platforms, such as PyTorch and PaddlePaddle, which
facilitates researchers to work on both large-scale datasets with millions of
images and low-shot counterparts with limited well-annotated data. More
importantly, along with face.evoLVe, images before & after alignment in the
common benchmark datasets are released with source codes and trained models
provided. All these efforts lower the technical burdens in reproducing the
existing methods for comparison, while users of our library could focus on
developing advanced approaches more efficiently. Last but not least,
face.evoLVe is well designed and vibrantly evolving, so that new face
recognition approaches can be easily plugged into our framework. Note that we
have used face.evoLVe to participate in a number of face recognition
competitions and secured the first place. The version that supports PyTorch is
publicly available at https://github.com/ZhaoJ9014/face.evoLVe.PyTorch and the
PaddlePaddle version is available at
https://github.com/ZhaoJ9014/face.evoLVe.PyTorch/tree/master/paddle.
Face.evoLVe has been widely used for face analytics, receiving 2.4K stars and
622 forks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to recognize people's attitudes from
multiple communication channels such as verbal content (i.e., text), voice, and
facial expressions. It has become a vibrant and important research topic in
natural language processing. Much research focuses on modeling the complex
intra- and inter-modal interactions between different communication channels.
However, current multimodal models with strong performance are often
deep-learning-based techniques and work like black boxes. It is not clear how
models utilize multimodal information for sentiment predictions. Despite recent
advances in techniques for enhancing the explainability of machine learning
models, they often target unimodal scenarios (e.g., images, sentences), and
little research has been done on explaining multimodal models. In this paper,
we present an interactive visual analytics system, M2Lens, to visualize and
explain multimodal models for sentiment analysis. M2Lens provides explanations
on intra- and inter-modal interactions at the global, subset, and local levels.
Specifically, it summarizes the influence of three typical interaction types
(i.e., dominance, complement, and conflict) on the model predictions. Moreover,
M2Lens identifies frequent and influential multimodal features and supports the
multi-faceted exploration of model behaviors from language, acoustic, and
visual modalities. Through two case studies and expert interviews, we
demonstrate our system can help users gain deep insights into the multimodal
models for sentiment analysis.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite being a critical communication skill, grasping humor is challenging
-- a successful use of humor requires a mixture of both engaging content
build-up and an appropriate vocal delivery (e.g., pause). Prior studies on
computational humor emphasize the textual and audio features immediately next
to the punchline, yet overlooking longer-term context setup. Moreover, the
theories are usually too abstract for understanding each concrete humor
snippet. To fill in the gap, we develop DeHumor, a visual analytical system for
analyzing humorous behaviors in public speaking. To intuitively reveal the
building blocks of each concrete example, DeHumor decomposes each humorous
video into multimodal features and provides inline annotations of them on the
video script. In particular, to better capture the build-ups, we introduce
content repetition as a complement to features introduced in theories of
computational humor and visualize them in a context linking graph. To help
users locate the punchlines that have the desired features to learn, we
summarize the content (with keywords) and humor feature statistics on an
augmented time matrix. With case studies on stand-up comedy shows and TED
talks, we show that DeHumor is able to highlight various building blocks of
humor examples. In addition, expert interviews with communication coaches and
humor researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of DeHumor for multimodal humor
analysis of speech content and vocal delivery.]]></summary>
