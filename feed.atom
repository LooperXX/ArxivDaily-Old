        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More recently, an Approximate SVD Based on Qatar Riyal (QR) Decomposition
(CSVD-QR) method for matrix complete problem is presented, whose computational
complexity is $O(r^2(m+n))$, which is mainly due to that $r$ is far less than
$\min\{m,n\}$, where $r$ represents the largest number of singular values of
matrix $X$. What is particularly interesting is that after replacing the
nuclear norm with the $L_{2,1}$ norm proposed based on this decomposition, as
the upper bound of the nuclear norm, when the intermediate matrix $D$ in its
decomposition is close to the diagonal matrix, it will converge to the nuclear
norm, and is exactly equal, when the $D$ matrix is equal to the diagonal
matrix, to the nuclear norm, which ingeniously avoids the calculation of the
singular value of the matrix. To the best of our knowledge, there is no
literature to generalize and apply it to solve tensor complete problems.
Inspired by this, in this paper we propose a class of tensor minimization model
based on $L_{2,1}$ norm and CSVD-QR method for the tensor complete problem,
which is convex and therefore has a global minimum solution.]]></summary>

trajectory prediction. Most existing methods consider the interactions between
pairwise traffic agents or in a local area, while the nature of interactions is
unlimited, involving an uncertain number of agents and non-local areas
simultaneously. Besides, they treat heterogeneous traffic agents the same,
namely those among agents of different categories, while neglecting people's
diverse reaction patterns toward traffic agents in ifferent categories. To
address these problems, we propose a simple yet effective Unlimited
Neighborhood Interaction Network (UNIN), which predicts trajectories of
heterogeneous agents in multiple categories. Specifically, the proposed
unlimited neighborhood interaction module generates the fused-features of all
agents involved in an interaction simultaneously, which is adaptive to any
number of agents and any range of interaction area. Meanwhile, a hierarchical
graph attention module is proposed to obtain category-to-category interaction
and agent-to-agent interaction. Finally, parameters of a Gaussian Mixture Model
are estimated for generating the future trajectories. Extensive experimental
results on benchmark datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement
of our method over the state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last few years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proved to
reach super-human performance in visual recognition tasks. However, CNNs can
easily be fooled by adversarial examples, i.e., maliciously-crafted images that
force the networks to predict an incorrect output while being extremely similar
to those for which a correct output is predicted. Regular adversarial examples
are not robust to input image transformations, which can then be used to detect
whether an adversarial example is presented to the network. Nevertheless, it is
still possible to generate adversarial examples that are robust to such
transformations.

This paper extensively explores the detection of adversarial examples via
image transformations and proposes a novel methodology, called \textit{defense
perturbation}, to detect robust adversarial examples with the same input
transformations the adversarial examples are robust to. Such a \textit{defense
perturbation} is shown to be an effective counter-measure to robust adversarial
examples.

Furthermore, multi-network adversarial examples are introduced. This kind of
adversarial examples can be used to simultaneously fool multiple networks,
which is critical in systems that use network redundancy, such as those based
on architectures with majority voting over multiple CNNs. An extensive set of
experiments based on state-of-the-art CNNs trained on the Imagenet dataset is
finally reported.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to strengthen the performance of novel
object detection with few labeled samples. To alleviate the constraint of few
samples, enhancing the generalization ability of learned features for novel
objects plays a key role. Thus, the feature learning process of FSOD should
focus more on intrinsical object characteristics, which are invariant under
different visual changes and therefore are helpful for feature generalization.
Unlike previous attempts of the meta-learning paradigm, in this paper, we
explore how to enhance object features with intrinsical characteristics that
are universal across different object categories. We propose a new prototype,
namely universal prototype, that is learned from all object categories. Besides
the advantage of characterizing invariant characteristics, the universal
prototypes alleviate the impact of unbalanced object categories. After
enhancing object features with the universal prototypes, we impose a
consistency loss to maximize the agreement between the enhanced features and
the original ones, which is beneficial for learning invariant object
characteristics. Thus, we develop a new framework of few-shot object detection
with universal prototypes ({FSOD}^{up}) that owns the merit of feature
generalization towards novel objects. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC and MS
COCO show the effectiveness of {FSOD}^{up}. Particularly, for the 1-shot case
of VOC Split2, {FSOD}^{up} outperforms the baseline by 6.8% in terms of mAP.]]></summary>

based statistical model that represents a 3D face using linear basis functions,
has shown promising results for reconstructing 3D faces from single-view
in-the-wild images. However, 3DMM has restricted representation power due to
the limited number of 3D scans and the global linear basis. To address the
limitations of 3DMM, we propose a straightforward learning-based method that
reconstructs a 3D face mesh through Free-Form Deformation (FFD) for the first
time. FFD is a geometric modeling method that embeds a reference mesh within a
parallelepiped grid and deforms the mesh by moving the sparse control points of
the grid. As FFD is based on mathematically defined basis functions, it has no
limitation in representation power. Thus, we can recover accurate 3D face
meshes by estimating appropriate deviation of control points as deformation
parameters. Although both 3DMM and FFD are parametric models, it is difficult
to predict the effect of the 3DMM parameters on the face shape, while the
deformation parameters of FFD are interpretable in terms of their effect on the
final shape of the mesh. This practical advantage of FFD allows the resulting
mesh and control points to serve as a good starting point for 3D face modeling,
in that ordinary users can fine-tune the mesh by using widely available 3D
software tools. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate how our method
successfully estimates the 3D face geometry and facial expressions from 2D face
images, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

few-shot learning research, however, has been driven by benchmark datasets that
lack the high variation that these applications will face when deployed in the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Point clouds acquired from scanning devices are often perturbed by noise,
which affects downstream tasks such as surface reconstruction and analysis. The
distribution of a noisy point cloud can be viewed as the distribution of a set
of noise-free samples $p(x)$ convolved with some noise model $n$, leading to
$(p * n)(x)$ whose mode is the underlying clean surface. To denoise a noisy
point cloud, we propose to increase the log-likelihood of each point from $p *
n$ via gradient ascent -- iteratively updating each point's position. Since $p
* n$ is unknown at test-time, and we only need the score (i.e., the gradient of
the log-probability function) to perform gradient ascent, we propose a neural
network architecture to estimate the score of $p * n$ given only noisy point
clouds as input. We derive objective functions for training the network and
develop a denoising algorithm leveraging on the estimated scores. Experiments
demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods under
a variety of noise models, and shows the potential to be applied in other tasks
such as point cloud upsampling. The code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this work, we address the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for
person re-ID where annotations are available for the source domain but not for
target. Previous methods typically follow a two-stage optimization pipeline,
where the network is first pre-trained on source and then fine-tuned on target
with pseudo labels created by feature clustering. Such methods sustain two main
limitations. (1) The label noise may hinder the learning of discriminative
features for recognizing target classes. (2) The domain gap may hinder
knowledge transferring from source to target. We propose three types of
technical schemes to alleviate these issues. First, we propose a cluster-wise
contrastive learning algorithm (CCL) by iterative optimization of feature
learning and cluster refinery to learn noise-tolerant representations in the
unsupervised manner. Second, we adopt a progressive domain adaptation (PDA)
strategy to gradually mitigate the domain gap between source and target data.
Third, we propose Fourier augmentation (FA) for further maximizing the class
separability of re-ID models by imposing extra constraints in the Fourier
space. We observe that these proposed schemes are capable of facilitating the
learning of discriminative feature representations. Experiments demonstrate
that our method consistently achieves notable improvements over the
state-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods on multiple benchmarks, e.g.,
surpassing MMT largely by 8.1\%, 9.9\%, 11.4\% and 11.1\% mAP on the
Market-to-Duke, Duke-to-Market, Market-to-MSMT and Duke-to-MSMT tasks,

has been extensively studied before, changing an unseen model's decisions to a
specific `targeted' class remains a challenging feat. In this paper, we propose
a new generative approach for highly transferable targeted perturbations
(\ours). We note that the existing methods are less suitable for this task due
to their reliance on class-boundary information that changes from one model to
another, thus reducing transferability. In contrast, our approach matches the
perturbed image `distribution' with that of the target class, leading to high
targeted transferability rates. To this end, we propose a new objective
function that not only aligns the global distributions of source and target
images, but also matches the local neighbourhood structure between the two
domains. Based on the proposed objective, we train a generator function that
can adaptively synthesize perturbations specific to a given input. Our
generative approach is independent of the source or target domain labels, while
consistently performs well against state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of
attack settings. As an example, we achieve $32.63\%$ target transferability
from (an adversarially weak) VGG19$_{BN}$ to (a strong) WideResNet on ImageNet

significance for a wide range of applications, which simultaneously brings an
urgent demand of large, challenging, and comprehensive benchmarks for the
development and evaluation of UAV-based models. However, existing benchmarks
have limitations in terms of the amount of captured data, types of data
modalities, categories of provided tasks, and diversities of subjects and
environments. Here we propose a new benchmark - UAVHuman - for human behavior
understanding with UAVs, which contains 67,428 multi-modal video sequences and
119 subjects for action recognition, 22,476 frames for pose estimation, 41,290
frames and 1,144 identities for person re-identification, and 22,263 frames for
attribute recognition. Our dataset was collected by a flying UAV in multiple
urban and rural districts in both daytime and nighttime over three months,
hence covering extensive diversities w.r.t subjects, backgrounds,
illuminations, weathers, occlusions, camera motions, and UAV flying attitudes.
Such a comprehensive and challenging benchmark shall be able to promote the
research of UAV-based human behavior understanding, including action
recognition, pose estimation, re-identification, and attribute recognition.
Furthermore, we propose a fisheye-based action recognition method that
mitigates the distortions in fisheye videos via learning unbounded
transformations guided by flat RGB videos. Experiments show the efficacy of our
method on the UAV-Human dataset. The project page:

configurations of rotation, translation, and size for object instances observed
in single, arbitrary views of cluttered scenes. In this paper, we propose a new
method of Dual Pose Network with refined learning of pose consistency for this
task, shortened as DualPoseNet. DualPoseNet stacks two parallel pose decoders
on top of a shared pose encoder, where the implicit decoder predicts object
poses with a working mechanism different from that of the explicit one; they
thus impose complementary supervision on the training of pose encoder. We
construct the encoder based on spherical convolutions, and design a module of
Spherical Fusion wherein for a better embedding of pose-sensitive features from
the appearance and shape observations. Given no testing CAD models, it is the
novel introduction of the implicit decoder that enables the refined pose
prediction during testing, by enforcing the predicted pose consistency between
the two decoders using a self-adaptive loss term. Thorough experiments on
benchmarks of both category- and instance-level object pose datasets confirm
efficacy of our designs. DualPoseNet outperforms existing methods with a large
margin in the regime of high precision. Our code is released publicly at

the choice of arms is controlled by self-interested agents, and the algorithm
can only issue recommendations. The algorithm controls the flow of information,
and the information asymmetry can incentivize the agents to explore. Prior work
achieves optimal regret rates up to multiplicative factors that become
arbitrarily large depending on the Bayesian priors, and scale exponentially in
the number of arms. A more basic problem of sampling each arm once runs into
similar factors.

We focus on the price of incentives: the loss in performance, broadly
construed, incurred for the sake of incentive-compatibility. We prove that
Thompson Sampling, a standard bandit algorithm, is incentive-compatible if
initialized with sufficiently many data points. The performance loss due to
incentives is therefore limited to the initial rounds when these data points
are collected. The problem is largely reduced to that of sample complexity: how
many rounds are needed? We address this question, providing matching upper and
lower bounds and instantiating them in various corollaries. Typically, the
optimal sample complexity is polynomial in the number of arms and exponential
in the "strength of beliefs".]]></summary>

have been successfully applied in the field of single image super-resolution
(SISR). To obtain better fidelity and visual quality, most of existing networks
are of heavy design with massive computation. However, the computation
resources of modern mobile devices are limited, which cannot easily support the
expensive cost. To this end, this paper explores a novel frequency-aware
dynamic network for dividing the input into multiple parts according to its
coefficients in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain. In practice, the
high-frequency part will be processed using expensive operations and the
lower-frequency part is assigned with cheap operations to relieve the
computation burden. Since pixels or image patches belong to low-frequency areas
contain relatively few textural details, this dynamic network will not affect
the quality of resulting super-resolution images. In addition, we embed
predictors into the proposed dynamic network to end-to-end fine-tune the
handcrafted frequency-aware masks. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark
SISR models and datasets show that the frequency-aware dynamic network can be
employed for various SISR neural architectures to obtain the better tradeoff
between visual quality and computational complexity. For instance, we can
reduce the FLOPs of SR models by approximate 50% while preserving
state-of-the-art SISR performance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The aim of this paper is to map agricultural crops by classifying satellite
image time series. Domain experts in agriculture work with crop type labels
that are organised in a hierarchical tree structure, where coarse classes (like
orchards) are subdivided into finer ones (like apples, pears, vines, etc.). We
develop a crop classification method that exploits this expert knowledge and
significantly improves the mapping of rare crop types. The three-level label
hierarchy is encoded in a convolutional, recurrent neural network (convRNN),
such that for each pixel the model predicts three labels at different level of
granularity. This end-to-end trainable, hierarchical network architecture
allows the model to learn joint feature representations of rare classes (e.g.,
apples, pears) at a coarser level (e.g., orchard), thereby boosting
classification performance at the fine-grained level. Additionally, labelling
at different granularity also makes it possible to adjust the output according
to the classification scores; as coarser labels with high confidence are
sometimes more useful for agricultural practice than fine-grained but very
uncertain labels. We validate the proposed method on a new, large dataset that
we make public. ZueriCrop covers an area of 50 km x 48 km in the Swiss cantons
of Zurich and Thurgau with a total of 116'000 individual fields spanning 48
crop classes, and 28,000 (multi-temporal) image patches from Sentinel-2. We
compare our proposed hierarchical convRNN model with several baselines,
including methods designed for imbalanced class distributions. The hierarchical
approach performs superior by at least 9.9 percentage points in F1-score.]]></summary>

with a single ray per pixel and may therefore produce renderings that are
excessively blurred or aliased when training or testing images observe scene
content at different resolutions. The straightforward solution of supersampling
by rendering with multiple rays per pixel is impractical for NeRF, because
rendering each ray requires querying a multilayer perceptron hundreds of times.
Our solution, which we call "mip-NeRF" (a la "mipmap"), extends NeRF to
represent the scene at a continuously-valued scale. By efficiently rendering
anti-aliased conical frustums instead of rays, mip-NeRF reduces objectionable
aliasing artifacts and significantly improves NeRF's ability to represent fine
details, while also being 7% faster than NeRF and half the size. Compared to
NeRF, mip-NeRF reduces average error rates by 17% on the dataset presented with
NeRF and by 60% on a challenging multiscale variant of that dataset that we
present. Mip-NeRF is also able to match the accuracy of a brute-force
supersampled NeRF on our multiscale dataset while being 22x faster.]]></summary>

in this study, a visual sensing approach driven by deep neural networks and

of a deep sensing system in the monsoon season in Taiwan was demonstrated, and
waterlogging events were predicted on the island-wide scale. The system could
sense approximately 2379 vision sources through an internet of video things
framework and transmit the event-location information in 5 min. The proposed

manual features, i.e., hand gestures, and fine-grained non-manual features
(NMFs), i.e., facial expression, mouth shapes, etc. Although manual features
are dominant, non-manual features also play an important role in the expression
of a sign word. Specifically, many sign words convey different meanings due to
non-manual features, even though they share the same hand gestures. This
ambiguity introduces great challenges in the recognition of sign words. To
tackle the above issue, we propose a simple yet effective architecture called
Global-local Enhancement Network (GLE-Net), including two mutually promoted
streams towards different crucial aspects of SLR. Of the two streams, one
captures the global contextual relationship, while the other stream captures
the discriminative fine-grained cues. Moreover, due to the lack of datasets
explicitly focusing on this kind of features, we introduce the first
non-manual-features-aware isolated Chinese sign language dataset~(NMFs-CSL)
with a total vocabulary size of 1,067 sign words in daily life. Extensive
experiments on NMFs-CSL and SLR500 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of

{\it e.g.}, generalizable classifier boundary. Our solution is to constrain
logits from the robust model that takes adversarial examples as input and makes
it similar to those from the clean model fed with corresponding natural data.
It lets the robust model inherit the classifier boundary of the clean model.
Moreover, we observe such boundary guidance can not only preserve high natural

facilitates progress for the adversarial community. Finally, extensive

disentangle human pose and body content. However, the latest methods hardly
focus on 3D information, and to avoid self-occlusion, a massive amount of input
images are needed. In this paper, we propose RIN, a novel volume-based
framework for reconstructing a textured 3D model from a single picture and
imitating a subject with the generated model. Specifically, to estimate most of
the human texture, we propose a U-Net-like front-to-back translation network.
With both front and back images input, the textured volume recovery module
allows us to color a volumetric human. A sequence of 3D poses then guides the
colored volume via Flowable Disentangle Networks as a volume-to-volume
translation task. To project volumes to a 2D plane during training, we design a
differentiable depth-aware renderer. Our experiments demonstrate that our
volume-based model is adequate for human imitation, and the back view can be
estimated reliably using our network. While prior works based on either 2D pose
or semantic map often fail for the unstable appearance of a human, our
framework can still produce concrete results, which are competitive to those

Despite the periodic revisit cycle, image sequences acquired by Earth
observation satellites are therefore irregularly sampled in time.
State-of-the-art methods for crop classification (and other time series
analysis tasks) rely on techniques that implicitly assume regular temporal
spacing between observations, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We
propose to use neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) in combination
with RNNs to classify crop types in irregularly spaced image sequences. The
resulting ODE-RNN models consist of two steps: an update step, where a
recurrent unit assimilates new input data into the model's hidden state; and a
prediction step, in which NODE propagates the hidden state until the next
observation arrives. The prediction step is based on a continuous
representation of the latent dynamics, which has several advantages. At the
conceptual level, it is a more natural way to describe the mechanisms that
govern the phenological cycle. From a practical point of view, it makes it
possible to sample the system state at arbitrary points in time, such that one
can integrate observations whenever they are available, and extrapolate beyond
the last observation. Our experiments show that ODE-RNN indeed improves
classification accuracy over common baselines such as LSTM, GRU, and temporal
convolution. The gains are most prominent in the challenging scenario where
only few observations are available (i.e., frequent cloud cover). Moreover, we
show that the ability to extrapolate translates to better classification
performance early in the season, which is important for forecasting.]]></summary>

Many machine-learning-based HSI super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been
proposed recently. However, one of the fundamental limitations of these
approaches is that they are highly dependent on image and camera settings and
can only learn to map an input HSI with one specific setting to an output HSI
with another. However, different cameras capture images with different spectral
response functions and bands numbers due to the diversity of HSI cameras.
Consequently, the existing machine-learning-based approaches fail to learn to
super-resolve HSIs for a wide variety of input-output band settings. We propose
a single Meta-Learning-Based Super-Resolution (MLSR) model, which can take in
HSI images at an arbitrary number of input bands' peak wavelengths and generate
SR HSIs with an arbitrary number of output bands' peak wavelengths. We leverage
NTIRE2020 and ICVL datasets to train and validate the performance of the MLSR
model. The results show that the single proposed model can successfully
generate super-resolved HSI bands at arbitrary input-output band settings. The
results are better or at least comparable to baselines that are separately
trained on a specific input-output band setting.]]></summary>

impressive performance in constrained scenarios, they are vulnerable to samples
created by unseen manipulation methods. Some recent works show improvements in
generalisation but rely on cues that are easily corrupted by common
post-processing operations such as compression. In this paper, we propose
LipForensics, a detection approach capable of both generalising to novel
manipulations and withstanding various distortions. LipForensics targets
high-level semantic irregularities in mouth movements, which are common in many
generated videos. It consists in first pretraining a spatio-temporal network to
perform visual speech recognition (lipreading), thus learning rich internal
representations related to natural mouth motion. A temporal network is
subsequently finetuned on fixed mouth embeddings of real and forged data in
order to detect fake videos based on mouth movements without overfitting to
low-level, manipulation-specific artefacts. Extensive experiments show that
this simple approach significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art in terms of
generalisation to unseen manipulations and robustness to perturbations, as well
as shed light on the factors responsible for its performance. Code is available

(or moment) semantically relevant to a language query. The solution to this
challenging task demands understanding videos' and queries' semantic content

idea is to recast this challenge into an algorithmic graph matching problem.
Fueled by recent advances in Graph Neural Networks, we propose to leverage
Graph Convolutional Networks to model video and textual information as well as
their semantic alignment. To enable the mutual exchange of information across
the modalities, we design a novel Video-Language Graph Matching Network
(VLG-Net) to match video and query graphs. Core ingredients include
representation graphs built atop video snippets and query tokens separately and
used to model intra-modality relationships. A Graph Matching layer is adopted
for cross-modal context modeling and multi-modal fusion. Finally, moment
candidates are created using masked moment attention pooling by fusing the
moment's enriched snippet features. We demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art grounding methods on three widely used datasets for temporal
localization of moments in videos with language queries: ActivityNet-Captions,
TACoS, and DiDeMo.]]></summary>

leveraging auxiliary information, such as attribute embedding. Despite the
encouraging results achieved, prior ZSL approaches focus on improving the
discriminant power of seen-class features, yet have largely overlooked the
geometric structure of the samples and the prototypes. The subsequent
attribute-based generative adversarial network (GAN), as a result, also
neglects the topological information in sample generation and further yields
inferior performances in classifying the visual features of unseen classes. In
this paper, we introduce a novel structure-aware feature generation scheme,
termed as SA-GAN, to explicitly account for the topological structure in
learning both the latent space and the generative networks. Specifically, we
introduce a constraint loss to preserve the initial geometric structure when
learning a discriminative latent space, and carry out our GAN training with
additional supervising signals from a structure-aware discriminator and a
reconstruction module. The former supervision distinguishes fake and real
samples based on their affinity to class prototypes, while the latter aims to
reconstruct the original feature space from the generated latent space. This
topology-preserving mechanism enables our method to significantly enhance the
generalization capability on unseen-classes and consequently improve the
classification performance. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed approach consistently outperforms the state of the art. Our code can
be found in the supplementary material and will also be made publicly

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Object detection in optical remote sensing images is an important and
challenging task. In recent years, the methods based on convolutional neural
networks have made good progress. However, due to the large variation in object
scale, aspect ratio, and arbitrary orientation, the detection performance is
difficult to be further improved. In this paper, we discuss the role of
discriminative features in object detection, and then propose a Critical
Feature Capturing Network (CFC-Net) to improve detection accuracy from three
aspects: building powerful feature representation, refining preset anchors, and
optimizing label assignment. Specifically, we first decouple the classification
and regression features, and then construct robust critical features adapted to
the respective tasks through the Polarization Attention Module (PAM). With the
extracted discriminative regression features, the Rotation Anchor Refinement
Module (R-ARM) performs localization refinement on preset horizontal anchors to
obtain superior rotation anchors. Next, the Dynamic Anchor Learning (DAL)
strategy is given to adaptively select high-quality anchors based on their
ability to capture critical features. The proposed framework creates more
powerful semantic representations for objects in remote sensing images and
achieves high-performance real-time object detection. Experimental results on
three remote sensing datasets including HRSC2016, DOTA, and UCAS-AOD show that
our method achieves superior detection performance compared with many
state-of-the-art approaches. Code and models are available at

neural networks (CNNs) over the past few decades, they can easily reach or even
exceed the performance of humans in certain tasks. However, a recently
discovered shortcoming of CNNs is that they are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. Although the adversarial robustness of CNNs can be improved by
adversarial training, there is a trade-off between standard accuracy and
adversarial robustness. From the neural architecture perspective, this paper
aims to improve the adversarial robustness of the backbone CNNs that have a
satisfactory accuracy. Under a minimal computational overhead, the introduction
of a dilation architecture is expected to be friendly with the standard
performance of the backbone CNN while pursuing adversarial robustness.
Theoretical analyses on the standard and adversarial error bounds naturally
motivate the proposed neural architecture dilation algorithm. Experimental
results on real-world datasets and benchmark neural networks demonstrate the

method to detect breast lesions in ultrafast DCE-MRI sequences. This method
uses both the three-dimensional spatial information and temporal information
obtained from the early-phase of the dynamic acquisition. Methods: The proposed
CADe method, based on a modified 3D RetinaNet model, operates on ultrafast T1
weighted sequences, which are preprocessed for motion compensation, temporal
normalization, and are cropped before passing into the model. The model is
optimized to enable the detection of relatively small breast lesions in a
screening setting, focusing on detection of lesions that are harder to
differentiate from confounding structures inside the breast. Results: The
method was developed based on a dataset consisting of 489 ultrafast MRI studies
obtained from 462 patients containing a total of 572 lesions (365 malignant,
207 benign) and achieved a detection rate, sensitivity, and detection rate of
benign lesions of 0.90 (0.876-0.934), 0.95 (0.934-0.980), and 0.81
(0.751-0.871) at 4 false positives per normal breast with 10-fold
cross-testing, respectively. Conclusions: The deep learning architecture used
for the proposed CADe application can efficiently detect benign and malignant
lesions on ultrafast DCE-MRI. Furthermore, utilizing the less visible hard-to
detect-lesions in training improves the learning process and, subsequently,
detection of malignant breast lesions.]]></summary>

reconstruction from polarization images, in this paper, we attempt to estimate
human pose and shape from single polarization images by leveraging the
polarization-induced geometric cues. A dedicated two-stage pipeline is
proposed: given a single polarization image, stage one (Polar2Normal) focuses
on the fine detailed human body surface normal estimation; stage two
(Polar2Shape) then reconstructs clothed human shape from the polarization image
and the estimated surface normal. To empirically validate our approach, a
dedicated dataset (PHSPD) is constructed, consisting of over 500K frames with
accurate pose and shape annotations. Empirical evaluations on this real-world

of our approach. It suggests polarization camera as a promising alternative to

each other for decades. Recently, hyperspectral-depth (HS-D) imaging emerges to
capture both information simultaneously by combining two different imaging
systems; one for depth, the other for spectrum. While being accurate, this
combinational approach induces increased form factor, cost, capture time, and
alignment/registration problems. In this work, departing from the combinational
principle, we propose a compact single-shot monocular HS-D imaging method. Our
method uses a diffractive optical element (DOE), the point spread function of
which changes with respect to both depth and spectrum. This enables us to
reconstruct spectrum and depth from a single captured image. To this end, we
develop a differentiable simulator and a neural-network-based reconstruction
that are jointly optimized via automatic differentiation. To facilitate
learning the DOE, we present a first HS-D dataset by building a benchtop HS-D

learning a mapping from a source domain to a target domain with unpaired image
data. Though the existing methods have achieved promising results, they still
produce visual artifacts, being able to translate low-level information but not
high-level semantics of input images. One possible reason is that generators do
not have the ability to perceive the most discriminative parts between the
source and target domains, thus making the generated images low quality. In
this paper, we propose a new Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Networks
(AttentionGAN) for the unpaired image-to-image translation task. AttentionGAN
can identify the most discriminative foreground objects and minimize the change
of the background. The attention-guided generators in AttentionGAN are able to
produce attention masks, and then fuse the generation output with the attention
masks to obtain high-quality target images. Accordingly, we also design a novel
attention-guided discriminator which only considers attended regions. Extensive
experiments are conducted on several generative tasks with eight public
datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method is effective to generate
sharper and more realistic images compared with existing competitive models.

pruning), which slims down a CNN by reducing the width (number of output
channels) of convolutional layers. Inspired by the neurobiology research about
the independence of remembering and forgetting, we propose to re-parameterize a
CNN into the remembering parts and forgetting parts, where the former learn to
maintain the performance and the latter learn to prune. Via training with
regular SGD on the former but a novel update rule with penalty gradients on the
latter, we realize structured sparsity. Then we equivalently merge the
remembering and forgetting parts into the original architecture with narrower
layers. In this sense, ResRep can be viewed as a successful application of
Structural Re-parameterization. Such a methodology distinguishes ResRep from
the traditional learning-based pruning paradigm that applies a penalty on
parameters to produce sparsity, which may suppress the parameters essential for
the remembering. ResRep slims down a standard ResNet-50 with 76.15% accuracy on
ImageNet to a narrower one with only 45% FLOPs and no accuracy drop, which is
the first to achieve lossless pruning with such a high compression ratio. The

of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for brain tumor segmentation with a low
computation requirement. The system consists of a CNN for the main processing
for the segmentation, a pre-CNN block for data reduction and post-CNN
refinement block. The unique CNN consists of 7 convolution layers involving
only 108 kernels and 20308 trainable parameters. It is custom-designed,
following the proposed paradigm of ASCNN (application specific CNN), to perform
mono-modality and cross-modality feature extraction, tumor localization and
pixel classification. Each layer fits the task assigned to it, by means of (i)
appropriate normalization applied to its input data, (ii) correct convolution
modes for the assigned task, and (iii) suitable nonlinear transformation to
optimize the convolution results. In this specific design context, the number
of kernels in each of the 7 layers is made to be just-sufficient for its task,
instead of exponentially growing over the layers, to increase information
density and to reduce randomness in the processing. The proposed activation
function Full-ReLU helps to halve the number of kernels in convolution layers
of high-pass filtering without degrading processing quality. A large number of
experiments with BRATS2018 dataset have been conducted to measure the
processing quality and reproducibility of the proposed system. The results
demonstrate that the system reproduces reliably almost the same output to the
same input after retraining. The mean dice scores for enhancing tumor, whole
tumor and tumor core are 77.2%, 89.2% and 76.3%, respectively. The simple
structure and reliable high processing quality of the proposed system will
facilitate its implementation and medical applications.]]></summary>

the image classification task among a wide range of commonly used datasets
(ImageNet, CIFAR, SVHN, Caltech 101, SUN397, etc.). SOTA performance on each of
the mentioned datasets is obtained by careful tuning of the model architecture
and training tricks according to the properties of the target data. Although
this approach allows setting academic records, it is unrealistic that an
average data scientist would have enough resources to build a sophisticated
training pipeline for every image classification task he meets in practice.
This work is focusing on reviewing the latest augmentation and regularization
methods for the image classification and exploring ways to automatically choose
some of the most important hyperparameters: total number of epochs, initial
learning rate value and it's schedule. Having a training procedure equipped
with a lightweight modern CNN architecture (like bileNetV3 or EfficientNet),
sufficient level of regularization and adaptive to data learning rate schedule,
we can achieve a reasonable performance on a variety of downstream image
classification tasks without manual tuning of parameters to each particular
task. Resulting models are computationally efficient and can be deployed to CPU
using the OpenVINO toolkit. Source code is available as a part of the OpenVINO

features of arbitrary views to a fixed number of view features, dubbed
canonical view representation, by aligning the arbitrary view features to a set
of learnable reference view features using optimal transport. In this way, each
3D shape with arbitrary views is represented by a fixed number of canonical
view features, which are further aggregated to generate a rich and robust 3D
shape representation for shape recognition. We also propose a canonical view
feature separation constraint to enforce that the view features in canonical
view representation can be embedded into scattered points in a Euclidean space.
Experiments on the ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and RGBD datasets show that our

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Typical adversarial-training-based unsupervised domain adaptation methods are
vulnerable when the source and target datasets are highly-complex or exhibit a
large discrepancy between their data distributions. Recently, several
Lipschitz-constraint-based methods have been explored. The satisfaction of
Lipschitz continuity guarantees a remarkable performance on a target domain.
However, they lack a mathematical analysis of why a Lipschitz constraint is
beneficial to unsupervised domain adaptation and usually perform poorly on
large-scale datasets. In this paper, we take the principle of utilizing a
Lipschitz constraint further by discussing how it affects the error bound of
unsupervised domain adaptation. A connection between them is built and an
illustration of how Lipschitzness reduces the error bound is presented. A
\textbf{local smooth discrepancy} is defined to measure Lipschitzness of a
target distribution in a pointwise way. When constructing a deep end-to-end
model, to ensure the effectiveness and stability of unsupervised domain
adaptation, three critical factors are considered in our proposed optimization
strategy, i.e., the sample amount of a target domain, dimension and batchsize
of samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our model performs well on
several standard benchmarks. Our ablation study shows that the sample amount of
a target domain, the dimension and batchsize of samples indeed greatly impact
Lipschitz-constraint-based methods' ability to handle large-scale datasets.

regularization method termed norm decay, which can effectively reduce the norms

norm-regularization methods, including norm decay, weight decay, and singular

hurt adversarial robustness. Observing this unexpected phenomenon, we compute
the norms of layers in the CNNs trained with three different adversarial
training frameworks and surprisingly find that adversarially robust CNNs have
comparable or even larger layer norms than their non-adversarially robust
counterparts. Furthermore, we prove that under a mild assumption, adversarially
robust classifiers can be achieved using neural networks, and an adversarially
robust neural network can have an arbitrarily large Lipschitz constant. For
this reason, enforcing small norms on CNN layers may be neither necessary nor

the new data. In this work, we consider how to efficiently retrain graph
convolution network (GCN) based recommender models, which are state-of-the-art
techniques for collaborative recommendation. To pursue high efficiency, we set
the target as using only new data for model updating, meanwhile not sacrificing
the recommendation accuracy compared with full model retraining. This is
non-trivial to achieve, since the interaction data participates in both the
graph structure for model construction and the loss function for model
learning, whereas the old graph structure is not allowed to use in model
updating. Towards the goal, we propose a \textit{Causal Incremental Graph
Convolution} approach, which consists of two new operators named
\textit{Incremental Graph Convolution} (IGC) and \textit{Colliding Effect
Distillation} (CED) to estimate the output of full graph convolution. In
particular, we devise simple and effective modules for IGC to ingeniously
combine the old representations and the incremental graph and effectively fuse
the long-term and short-term preference signals. CED aims to avoid the
out-of-date issue of inactive nodes that are not in the incremental graph,
which connects the new data with inactive nodes through causal inference. In
particular, CED estimates the causal effect of new data on the representation
of inactive nodes through the control of their collider. Extensive experiments
on three real-world datasets demonstrate both accuracy gains and significant
speed-ups over the existing retraining mechanism.]]></summary>

first learn to understand the photo, then colorize it. Thus, our work can
provide plausible colors at a semantic level. Plus, the semantic information of
the learned model becomes understandable and able to interact. Additionally, we
also prove that Instance Normalization is also a missing ingredient for
colorization, then re-design the inference flow of U-Net to have two streams of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The proliferation of 3D scanning technology has driven a need for methods to
interpret geometric data, particularly for human subjects. In this paper we
propose an elegant fusion of regression (bottom-up) and generative (top-down)
methods to fit a parametric template model to raw scan meshes.

Our first major contribution is an intrinsic convolutional mesh U-net
architecture that predicts pointwise correspondence to a template surface.
Soft-correspondence is formulated as coordinates in a newly-constructed
Cartesian space. Modeling correspondence as Euclidean proximity enables
efficient optimization, both for network training and for the next step of the
algorithm.

Our second contribution is a generative optimization algorithm that uses the
U-net correspondence predictions to guide a parametric Iterative Closest Point
registration. By employing pre-trained human surface parametric models we
maximally leverage domain-specific prior knowledge.

The pairing of a mesh-convolutional network with generative model fitting
enables us to predict correspondence for real human surface scans including
occlusions, partialities, and varying genus (e.g. from self-contact). We
evaluate the proposed method on the FAUST correspondence challenge where we
achieve 20% (33%) improvement over state of the art methods for inter- (intra-)
subject correspondence.]]></summary>

achieved unprecedented performance in various computer vision tasks, but the
rationale for the computations and structures of successful neural networks is
not fully understood. Theories abound for the aptitude of convolutional neural
networks for image classification, but less is understood about why such models
would be capable of complex visual tasks such as inference and anomaly
identification. Here, we propose a sparse coding interpretation of neural
networks that have ReLU activation and of convolutional neural networks in
particular. In sparse coding, when the model's basis functions are assumed to
be orthogonal, the optimal coefficients are given by the soft-threshold
function of the basis functions projected onto the input image. In a
non-negative variant of sparse coding, the soft-threshold function becomes a
ReLU. Here, we derive these solutions via sparse coding with orthogonal-assumed
basis functions, then we derive the convolutional neural network forward
transformation from a modified non-negative orthogonal sparse coding model with
an exponential prior parameter for each sparse coding coefficient. Next, we
derive a complete convolutional neural network without normalization and
pooling by adding logistic regression to a hierarchical sparse coding model.
Finally we motivate potentially more robust forward transformations by
maintaining sparse priors in convolutional neural networks as well performing a
stronger nonlinear transformation.]]></summary>

regarding quality and controllability, they are struggling to generate temporal
coherent face videos. In this work, we explore to take full advantage of the

propose a novel end-to-end framework, which consists of two major stages. The
first stage is a fully temporal convolution network (FTCN). The key insight of
FTCN is to reduce the spatial convolution kernel size to 1, while maintaining
the temporal convolution kernel size unchanged. We surprisingly find this
special design can benefit the model for extracting the temporal features as
well as improve the generalization capability. The second stage is a Temporal
Transformer network, which aims to explore the long-term temporal coherence.
The proposed framework is general and flexible, which can be directly trained

pipelines including object detection, weakly supervised detection, object
discovery, tracking, etc. Compared to the learning-free methods, learning-based
proposals have become popular recently due to the growing interest in object
detection. The common paradigm is to learn object proposals from data labeled
with a set of object regions and their corresponding categories. However, this
approach often struggles with novel objects in the open world that are absent
in the training set. In this paper, we identify that the problem is that the
binary classifiers in existing proposal methods tend to overfit to the training
categories. Therefore, we propose a classification-free Object Localization
Network (OLN) which estimates the objectness of each region purely by how well
the location and shape of a region overlap with any ground-truth object (e.g.,
centerness and IoU). This simple strategy learns generalizable objectness and
outperforms existing proposals on cross-category generalization on COCO, as
well as cross-dataset evaluation on RoboNet, Object365, and EpicKitchens.
Finally, we demonstrate the merit of OLN for long-tail object detection on
large vocabulary dataset, LVIS, where we notice clear improvement in rare and
common categories.]]></summary>

temporal action localization has been attracting increasing attention. With
only video annotations, most existing methods seek to handle this task with a
localization-by-classification framework, which generally adopts a selector to
select snippets of high probabilities of actions or namely the foreground.
Nevertheless, the existing foreground selection strategies have a major
limitation of only considering the unilateral relation from foreground to
actions, which cannot guarantee the foreground-action consistency. In this
paper, we present a framework named FAC-Net based on the I3D backbone, on which
three branches are appended, named class-wise foreground classification branch,
class-agnostic attention branch and multiple instance learning branch. First,
our class-wise foreground classification branch regularizes the relation
between actions and foreground to maximize the foreground-background
separation. Besides, the class-agnostic attention branch and multiple instance
learning branch are adopted to regularize the foreground-action consistency and
help to learn a meaningful foreground classifier. Within each branch, we
introduce a hybrid attention mechanism, which calculates multiple attention
scores for each snippet, to focus on both discriminative and
less-discriminative snippets to capture the full action boundaries.
Experimental results on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3 demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of our method. Our code is available at

development of advanced machine learning techniques. Although much attention
has been paid to large and complex data sets resulting from high-throughput
sequencing, advances in high-quality video recording technology have begun to
generate similarly rich data sets requiring sophisticated techniques from both
computer vision and time-series analysis. Moreover, just as studying gene
expression patterns in one organism can reveal general principles that apply to
other organisms, the study of complex social interactions in an experimentally
tractable model system, such as a laboratory ant colony, can provide general
principles about the dynamics of other social groups. Here, we focus on one
such example from the study of reproductive regulation in small laboratory
colonies of more than 50 Harpegnathos ants. These ants can be artificially
induced to begin a ~20 day process of hierarchy reformation. Although the
conclusion of this process is conspicuous to a human observer, it remains
unclear which behaviors during the transient period are contributing to the
process. To address this issue, we explore the potential application of
One-class Classification (OC) to the detection of abnormal states in ant
colonies for which behavioral data is only available for the normal societal
conditions during training. Specifically, we build upon the Deep Support Vector
Data Description (DSVDD) and introduce the Inner-Outlier Generator (IO-GEN)
that synthesizes fake "inner outlier" observations during training that are
near the center of the DSVDD data description. We show that IO-GEN increases
the reliability of the final OC classifier relative to other DSVDD baselines.
This method can be used to screen video frames for which additional human
observation is needed.]]></summary>

allowing to increase the resolution of an image.The need for high-resolution
digital images exists in diverse domains, for example the medical and spatial

time of the shooting, but it is often synonymic of important costs because of
the necessary material to avoid such costs, it is known how to use methods of
super-resolution reconstruction, consisting from one or several low resolution
images to obtain a high-resolution image. The american patent US 9208537
describes such an algorithm. A zone of one low-resolution image is isolated and
categorized according to the information contained in pixels forming the
borders of the zone. The category of it zone determines the type of
interpolation used to add pixels in aforementioned zone, to increase the
neatness of the images. It is also known how to reconstruct a low-resolution
image there high-resolution image by using a model of super-resolution
reconstruction whose learning is based on networks of neurons and on image or a
picture library. The demand of chinese patent CN 107563965 and the scientist
publication "Pixel Recursive Super Resolution", R. Dahl, M. Norouzi, J. Shlens
propose such methods. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that it is
possible to reconstruct coherent human faces from very degraded pixelated
images with a very fast algorithm, more faster than compressed sensing (CS),
easier to compute and without deep learning, so without important technology
resources, i.e. a large database of thousands training images (see
arXiv:2003.13063).

architecture search. Previous two-stage one-shot approaches are limited by
search space with a fixed depth. It seems handy to include an additional skip
connection in the search space to make depths variable. However, it creates a
large range of perturbation during supernet training and it has difficulty
giving a confident ranking for subnetworks. In this paper, we discover that
skip connections bring about significant feature inconsistency compared with
other operations, which potentially degrades the supernet performance. Based on
this observation, we tackle the problem by imposing an equivariant learnable
stabilizer to homogenize such disparities. Experiments show that our proposed
stabilizer helps to improve the supernet's convergence as well as ranking
performance. With an evolutionary search backend that incorporates the
stabilized supernet as an evaluator, we derive a family of state-of-the-art

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hashing technology has been widely used in image retrieval due to its
computational and storage efficiency. Recently, deep unsupervised hashing
methods have attracted increasing attention due to the high cost of human
annotations in the real world and the superiority of deep learning technology.
However, most deep unsupervised hashing methods usually pre-compute a
similarity matrix to model the pairwise relationship in the pre-trained feature
space. Then this similarity matrix would be used to guide hash learning, in
which most of the data pairs are treated equivalently. The above process is
confronted with the following defects: 1) The pre-computed similarity matrix is
inalterable and disconnected from the hash learning process, which cannot
explore the underlying semantic information. 2) The informative data pairs may
be buried by the large number of less-informative data pairs. To solve the
aforementioned problems, we propose a \textbf{Deep Self-Adaptive
Hashing~(DSAH)} model to adaptively capture the semantic information with two
special designs: \textbf{Adaptive Neighbor Discovery~(AND)} and
\textbf{Pairwise Information Content~(PIC)}. Firstly, we adopt the AND to
initially construct a neighborhood-based similarity matrix, and then refine
this initial similarity matrix with a novel update strategy to further
investigate the semantic structure behind the learned representation. Secondly,
we measure the priorities of data pairs with PIC and assign adaptive weights to
them, which is relies on the assumption that more dissimilar data pairs contain
more discriminative information for hash learning. Extensive experiments on
several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the above two technologies
facilitate the deep hashing model to achieve superior performance in a
self-adaptive manner.]]></summary>

ability and high learning accuracy of these schemes cannot be ensured at the
same time, which will impede the wide application of FL in practice (especially
for medical or financial institutions that require both high accuracy and
strong privacy guarantee). To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose
\emph{an efficient model perturbation method for federated learning} to defend
reconstruction and membership inference attacks launched by curious clients. On
the one hand, similar to the differential privacy, our method also selects
random numbers as perturbed noises added to the global model parameters, and
thus it is very efficient and easy to be integrated in practice. Meanwhile, the
random selected noises are positive real numbers and the corresponding value
can be arbitrarily large, and thus the strong defence ability can be ensured.
On the other hand, unlike differential privacy or other perturbation methods
that cannot eliminate the added noises, our method allows the server to recover
the true gradients by eliminating the added noises. Therefore, our method does
not hinder learning accuracy at all.]]></summary>

and functionality of neurons in brain circuit activities. However, the
performance of existing tracing algorithms is hinged by the low image quality.
Recently, a series of deep learning based segmentation methods have been
proposed to improve the quality of raw 3D optical image stacks by removing
noises and restoring neuronal structures from low-contrast background. Due to
the variety of neuron morphology and the lack of large neuron datasets, most of
current neuron segmentation models rely on introducing complex and
specially-designed submodules to a base architecture with the aim of encoding
better feature representations. Though successful, extra burden would be put on
computation during inference. Therefore, rather than modifying the base
network, we shift our focus to the dataset itself. The encoder-decoder backbone
used in most neuron segmentation models attends only intra-volume voxel points
to learn structural features of neurons but neglect the shared intrinsic
semantic features of voxels belonging to the same category among different
volumes, which is also important for expressive representation learning. Hence,
to better utilise the scarce dataset, we propose to explicitly exploit such
intrinsic features of voxels through a novel voxel-level cross-volume
representation learning paradigm on the basis of an encoder-decoder
segmentation model. Our method introduces no extra cost during inference.
Evaluated on 42 3D neuron images from BigNeuron project, our proposed method is
demonstrated to improve the learning ability of the original segmentation model
and further enhancing the reconstruction performance.]]></summary>

design: We first run 3D pose regression methods for face, hands, and body
independently, followed by composing the regression outputs via an integration
module. The separate regression modules allow us to take full advantage of
their state-of-the-art performances without compromising the original accuracy
and reliability in practice. We develop three different integration modules
that trade off between latency and accuracy. All of them are capable of
providing simple yet effective solutions to unify the separate outputs into
seamless whole-body pose estimation results. We quantitatively and
qualitatively demonstrate that our modularized system outperforms both the
optimization-based and end-to-end methods of estimating whole-body pose.]]></summary>

data that is out of the domain of the training distribution. This is especially
true for image analysis in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, as variations in
hardware and software create non-standard intensities, contrasts, and noise
distributions across scanners. Recently, image translation models have been
proposed to augment data across domains to create synthetic data points. In
this paper, we investigate the application an unsupervised image translation
model to augment MR images from a source dataset to a target dataset.
Specifically, we want to evaluate how well these models can create synthetic
data points representative of the target dataset through image translation, and
to see if a segmentation model trained these synthetic data points would
approach the performance of a model trained directly on the target dataset. We
consider three configurations of augmentation between datasets consisting of
translation between images, between scanner vendors, and from labels to images.
It was found that the segmentation models trained on synthetic data from labels
to images configuration yielded the closest performance to the segmentation
model trained directly on the target dataset. The Dice coeffcient score per
each target vendor (GE, Siemens, Philips) for training on synthetic data was
0.63, 0.64, and 0.58, compared to training directly on target dataset was 0.65,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generating conversational gestures from speech audio is challenging due to
the inherent one-to-many mapping between audio and body motions. Conventional
CNNs/RNNs assume one-to-one mapping, and thus tend to predict the average of
all possible target motions, resulting in plain/boring motions during
inference. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a novel conditional
variational autoencoder (VAE) that explicitly models one-to-many
audio-to-motion mapping by splitting the cross-modal latent code into shared
code and motion-specific code. The shared code mainly models the strong
correlation between audio and motion (such as the synchronized audio and motion
beats), while the motion-specific code captures diverse motion information
independent of the audio. However, splitting the latent code into two parts
poses training difficulties for the VAE model. A mapping network facilitating
random sampling along with other techniques including relaxed motion loss,
bicycle constraint, and diversity loss are designed to better train the VAE.
Experiments on both 3D and 2D motion datasets verify that our method generates
more realistic and diverse motions than state-of-the-art methods,
quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can
be readily used to generate motion sequences with user-specified motion clips
on the timeline. Code and more results are at

using centralized data available on the Internet. However, the increasing
awareness of privacy protection limits sharing of decentralized unlabeled image
data that grows explosively in multiple parties (e.g., mobile phones and
cameras). As such, a natural problem is how to leverage these data to learn
visual representations for downstream tasks while preserving data privacy. To
address this problem, we propose a novel federated unsupervised learning
framework, FedU. In this framework, each party trains models from unlabeled
data independently using contrastive learning with an online network and a
target network. Then, a central server aggregates trained models and updates
clients' models with the aggregated model. It preserves data privacy as each
party only has access to its raw data. Decentralized data among multiple
parties are normally non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID),
leading to performance degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose two
simple but effective methods: 1) We design the communication protocol to upload
only the encoders of online networks for server aggregation and update them
with the aggregated encoder; 2) We introduce a new module to dynamically decide
how to update predictors based on the divergence caused by non-IID. The
predictor is the other component of the online network. Extensive experiments
and ablations demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of FedU. It
outperforms training with only one party by over 5% and other methods by over
14% in linear and semi-supervised evaluation on non-IID data.]]></summary>

the camera pose. Our loss function, called sampling loss, is point
cloud-centric, evaluated at the projected location of every point in the point
cloud. In contrast, conventional photometric loss is image-centric, comparing
colors at each pixel location. With a simple change in the compared entities,
sampling loss effectively overcomes the severe visual distortion of
omnidirectional images, and enjoys the global context of the 360 view to handle
challenging scenarios for visual localization. PICCOLO outperforms existing
omnidirectional localization algorithms in both accuracy and stability when
evaluated in various environments.]]></summary>

descriptions, which requires the model to fully understand video scenes
including objects and their interactions. Prevailing methods adopt
off-the-shelf object detection networks to give object proposals and use the
attention mechanism to model the relations between objects. They often miss
some undefined semantic concepts of the pretrained model and fail to identify
exact predicate relationships between objects. In this paper, we investigate an
open research task of generating text descriptions for the given videos, and
propose Cross-Modal Graph (CMG) with meta concepts for video captioning.
Specifically, to cover the useful semantic concepts in video captions, we
weakly learn the corresponding visual regions for text descriptions, where the
associated visual regions and textual words are named cross-modal meta
concepts. We further build meta concept graphs dynamically with the learned
cross-modal meta concepts. We also construct holistic video-level and local
frame-level video graphs with the predicted predicates to model video sequence
structures. We validate the efficacy of our proposed techniques with extensive
experiments and achieve state-of-the-art results on two public datasets.]]></summary>

pattern recognition, mainly due to similarity in structure of characters,
different handwriting styles, noisy datasets and a large variety of languages
and scripts. HCR problem is studied extensively for a few decades but there is
very limited research on script independent models. This is because of factors,
like, diversity of scripts, focus of the most of conventional research efforts
on handcrafted feature extraction techniques which are language/script specific
and are not always available, and unavailability of public datasets and codes
to reproduce the results. On the other hand, deep learning has witnessed huge
success in different areas of pattern recognition, including HCR, and provides
end-to-end learning, i.e., automated feature extraction and recognition. In
this paper, we have proposed a novel deep learning architecture which exploits
transfer learning and image-augmentation for end-to-end learning for script
independent handwritten character recognition, called HCR-Net. The network is
based on a novel transfer learning approach for HCR, where some of lower layers
of a pre-trained VGG16 network are utilised. Due to transfer learning and
image-augmentation, HCR-Net provides faster training, better performance and
better generalisations. The experimental results on publicly available datasets
of Bangla, Punjabi, Hindi, English, Swedish, Urdu, Farsi, Tibetan, Kannada,
Malayalam, Telugu, Marathi, Nepali and Arabic languages prove the efficacy of
HCR-Net and establishes several new benchmarks. For reproducibility of the
results and for the advancements of the HCR research, complete code is publicly

(source) and test (target) datasets follow completely the same distribution.
This assumption is, however, often violated in uncertain real-world
applications, which motivates the study of learning under covariate shift. In
this setting, the naive use of adaptive hyperparameter optimization methods
such as Bayesian optimization does not work as desired since it does not
address the distributional shift among different datasets. In this work, we
consider a novel hyperparameter optimization problem under the multi-source
covariate shift whose goal is to find the optimal hyperparameters for a target
task of interest using only unlabeled data in a target task and labeled data in
multiple source tasks. To conduct efficient hyperparameter optimization for the
target task, it is essential to estimate the target objective using only the
available information. To this end, we construct the variance reduced estimator
that unbiasedly approximates the target objective with a desirable variance
property. Building on the proposed estimator, we provide a general and
tractable hyperparameter optimization procedure, which works preferably in our
setting with a no-regret guarantee. The experiments demonstrate that the
proposed framework broadens the applications of automated hyperparameter
optimization.]]></summary>

tasks, even better than Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). In this work, we
present a novel, flexible, and effective transformer-based model for
high-quality instance segmentation. The proposed method, Segmenting Objects
with TRansformers (SOTR), simplifies the segmentation pipeline, building on an
alternative CNN backbone appended with two parallel subtasks: (1) predicting
per-instance category via transformer and (2) dynamically generating
segmentation mask with the multi-level upsampling module. SOTR can effectively
extract lower-level feature representations and capture long-range context
dependencies by Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and twin transformer,
respectively. Meanwhile, compared with the original transformer, the proposed
twin transformer is time- and resource-efficient since only a row and a column
attention are involved to encode pixels. Moreover, SOTR is easy to be
incorporated with various CNN backbones and transformer model variants to make
considerable improvements for the segmentation accuracy and training
convergence. Extensive experiments show that our SOTR performs well on the MS
COCO dataset and surpasses state-of-the-art instance segmentation approaches.
We hope our simple but strong framework could serve as a preferment baseline
for instance-level recognition. Our code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chest radiograph (CXR) interpretation in pediatric patients is error-prone
and requires a high level of understanding of radiologic expertise. Recently,
deep convolutional neural networks (D-CNNs) have shown remarkable performance
in interpreting CXR in adults. However, there is a lack of evidence indicating
that D-CNNs can recognize accurately multiple lung pathologies from pediatric
CXR scans. In particular, the development of diagnostic models for the
detection of pediatric chest diseases faces significant challenges such as (i)
lack of physician-annotated datasets and (ii) class imbalance problems. In this
paper, we retrospectively collect a large dataset of 5,017 pediatric CXR scans,
for which each is manually labeled by an experienced radiologist for the
presence of 10 common pathologies. A D-CNN model is then trained on 3,550
annotated scans to classify multiple pediatric lung pathologies automatically.
To address the high-class imbalance issue, we propose to modify and apply
"Distribution-Balanced loss" for training D-CNNs which reshapes the standard
Binary-Cross Entropy loss (BCE) to efficiently learn harder samples by
down-weighting the loss assigned to the majority classes. On an independent
test set of 777 studies, the proposed approach yields an area under the
receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.709 (95% CI, 0.690-0.729). The
sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score at the cutoff value are 0.722
(0.694-0.750), 0.579 (0.563-0.595), and 0.389 (0.373-0.405), respectively.
These results significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods on
most of the target diseases. Moreover, our ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of the proposed loss function compared to other standard losses,
e.g., BCE and Focal Loss, for this learning task. Overall, we demonstrate the
potential of D-CNNs in interpreting pediatric CXRs.]]></summary>

of tasks without incurring catastrophic forgetting. CL settings proposed in the
literature assume that every incoming example is paired with ground-truth
annotations. However, this clashes with many real-world applications: gathering
labeled data, which is in itself tedious and expensive, becomes indeed
infeasible when data flow as a stream and must be consumed in real-time. This
work explores Weakly Supervised Continual Learning (WSCL): here, only a small
fraction of labeled input examples are shown to the learner. We assess how
current CL methods (e.g.: EWC, LwF, iCaRL, ER, GDumb, DER) perform in this
novel and challenging scenario, in which overfitting entangles forgetting.
Subsequently, we design two novel WSCL methods which exploit metric learning
and consistency regularization to leverage unsupervised data while learning. In
doing so, we show that not only our proposals exhibit higher flexibility when
supervised information is scarce, but also that less than 25% labels can be
enough to reach or even outperform SOTA methods trained under full supervision.]]></summary>

structure of renal compartments from abdominal CTA images and is of great
significance to the diagnosis and treatment for kidney diseases. However, due
to the unclear compartment boundary, thin compartment structure and large
anatomy variation of 3D kidney CT images, deep-learning based renal compartment
segmentation is a challenging task. We propose a novel weakly supervised
learning framework, Cycle Prototype Network, for 3D renal compartment
segmentation. It has three innovations: 1) A Cycle Prototype Learning (CPL) is
proposed to learn consistency for generalization. It learns from pseudo labels
through the forward process and learns consistency regularization through the
reverse process. The two processes make the model robust to noise and
label-efficient. 2) We propose a Bayes Weakly Supervised Module (BWSM) based on
cross-period prior knowledge. It learns prior knowledge from cross-period
unlabeled data and perform error correction automatically, thus generates
accurate pseudo labels. 3) We present a Fine Decoding Feature Extractor (FDFE)
for fine-grained feature extraction. It combines global morphology information
and local detail information to obtain feature maps with sharp detail, so the
model will achieve fine segmentation on thin structures. Our model achieves
Dice of 79.1% and 78.7% with only four labeled images, achieving a significant
improvement by about 20% than typical prototype model PANet.]]></summary>

deep CNNs for categorizing unknown DICOM X-ray images into five anatomical
groups: abdominal, adult chest, pediatric chest, spine, and others. To this
end, a large-scale X-ray dataset consisting of 16,093 images has been collected
and manually classified. We then trained a set of state-of-the-art deep CNNs
using a training set of 11,263 images. These networks were then evaluated on an
independent test set of 2,419 images and showed superior performance in
classifying the body parts. Specifically, our best performing model achieved a
recall of 0.982 (95% CI, 0.977-0.988), a precision of 0.985 (95% CI,
0.975-0.989) and a F1-score of 0.981 (95% CI, 0.976-0.987), whilst requiring
less computation for inference (0.0295 second per image). Our external validity
on 1,000 X-ray images shows the robustness of the proposed approach across
hospitals. These remarkable performances indicate that deep CNNs can accurately
and effectively differentiate human body parts from X-ray scans, thereby
providing potential benefits for a wide range of applications in clinical
settings. The dataset, codes, and trained deep learning models from this study
will be made publicly available on our project website at https://vindr.ai/.]]></summary>

research. In the general English domain, transformer-based models have achieved
state-of-the-art performances on various NLP benchmarks. In the clinical
domain, researchers also have investigated transformer models for clinical
applications. The goal of this study is to systematically explore three widely
used transformer-based models (i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet) for clinical
relation extraction and develop an open-source package with clinical
pre-trained transformer-based models to facilitate information extraction in
the clinical domain. We developed a series of clinical RE models based on three
transformer architectures, namely BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet. We evaluated these
models using 2 publicly available datasets from 2018 MADE1.0 and 2018 n2c2
challenges. We compared two classification strategies (binary vs. multi-class
classification) and investigated two approaches to generate candidate relations
in different experimental settings. In this study, we compared three
transformer-based (BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet) models for relation extraction. We
demonstrated that the RoBERTa-clinical RE model achieved the best performance
on the 2018 MADE1.0 dataset with an F1-score of 0.8958. On the 2018 n2c2
dataset, the XLNet-clinical model achieved the best F1-score of 0.9610. Our
results indicated that the binary classification strategy consistently
outperformed the multi-class classification strategy for clinical relation
extraction. Our methods and models are publicly available at
https://github.com/uf-hobi-informatics-lab/ClinicalTransformerRelationExtraction.
We believe this work will improve current practice on clinical relation
extraction and other related NLP tasks in the biomedical domain.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Machine unlearning is the task of updating machine learning (ML) models after
a subset of the training data they were trained on is deleted. Methods for the
task are desired to combine effectiveness and efficiency, i.e., they should
effectively "unlearn" deleted data, but in a way that does not require
excessive computation effort (e.g., a full retraining) for a small amount of
deletions. Such a combination is typically achieved by tolerating some amount
of approximation in the unlearning. In addition, laws and regulations in the
spirit of "the right to be forgotten" have given rise to requirements for
certifiability, i.e., the ability to demonstrate that the deleted data has
indeed been unlearned by the ML model.

In this paper, we present an experimental study of the three state-of-the-art
approximate unlearning methods for linear models and demonstrate the trade-offs
between efficiency, effectiveness and certifiability offered by each method. In
implementing the study, we extend some of the existing works and describe a
common ML pipeline to compare and evaluate the unlearning methods on six
real-world datasets and a variety of settings. We provide insights into the
effect of the quantity and distribution of the deleted data on ML models and
the performance of each unlearning method in different settings. We also
propose a practical online strategy to determine when the accumulated error
from approximate unlearning is large enough to warrant a full retrain of the ML
model.]]></summary>

performance often drops significantly for non-frontal facial images. We propose
Contrastive Learning of Multi-view facial Expressions (CL-MEx) to exploit
facial images captured simultaneously from different angles towards FER. CL-MEx
is a two-step training framework. In the first step, an encoder network is
pre-trained with the proposed self-supervised contrastive loss, where it learns
to generate view-invariant embeddings for different views of a subject. The
model is then fine-tuned with labeled data in a supervised setting. We
demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on two multi-view FER
datasets, KDEF and DDCF, where state-of-the-art performances are achieved.
Further experiments show the robustness of our method in dealing with
challenging angles and reduced amounts of labeled data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper describes Georeference Contrastive Learning of visual
Representation (GeoCLR) for efficient training of deep-learning Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). The method leverages georeference information by
generating a similar image pair using images taken of nearby locations, and
contrasting these with an image pair that is far apart. The underlying
assumption is that images gathered within a close distance are more likely to
have similar visual appearance, where this can be reasonably satisfied in
seafloor robotic imaging applications where image footprints are limited to
edge lengths of a few metres and are taken so that they overlap along a
vehicle's trajectory, whereas seafloor substrates and habitats have patch sizes
that are far larger. A key advantage of this method is that it is
self-supervised and does not require any human input for CNN training. The
method is computationally efficient, where results can be generated between
dives during multi-day AUV missions using computational resources that would be
accessible during most oceanic field trials. We apply GeoCLR to habitat
classification on a dataset that consists of ~86k images gathered using an
Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). We demonstrate how the latent
representations generated by GeoCLR can be used to efficiently guide human
annotation efforts, where the semi-supervised framework improves classification
accuracy by an average of 11.8 % compared to state-of-the-art transfer learning
using the same CNN and equivalent number of human annotations for training.]]></summary>

non-overlapping camera views. Since person ReID data contains sensitive
personal information, researchers have adopted federated learning, an emerging
distributed training method, to mitigate the privacy leakage risks. However,
existing studies rely on data labels that are laborious and time-consuming to
obtain. We present FedUReID, a federated unsupervised person ReID system to
learn person ReID models without any labels while preserving privacy. FedUReID
enables in-situ model training on edges with unlabeled data. A cloud server
aggregates models from edges instead of centralizing raw data to preserve data
privacy. Moreover, to tackle the problem that edges vary in data volumes and
distributions, we personalize training in edges with joint optimization of
cloud and edge. Specifically, we propose personalized epoch to reassign
computation throughout training, personalized clustering to iteratively predict
suitable labels for unlabeled data, and personalized update to adapt the server
aggregated model to each edge. Extensive experiments on eight person ReID
datasets demonstrate that FedUReID not only achieves higher accuracy but also
reduces computation cost by 29%. Our FedUReID system with the joint
optimization will shed light on implementing federated learning to more

made by machine learning systems. However, discriminative classifiers based on
deep neural networks are often criticized for producing overconfident
predictions that fail to reflect the true correctness likelihood of
classification accuracy. We argue that such an inability to model uncertainty
is mainly caused by the closed-world nature in softmax: a model trained by the
cross-entropy loss will be forced to classify input into one of $K$ pre-defined
categories with high probability. To address this problem, we for the first
time propose a novel $K$+1-way softmax formulation, which incorporates the
modeling of open-world uncertainty as the extra dimension. To unify the
learning of the original $K$-way classification task and the extra dimension
that models uncertainty, we propose a novel energy-based objective function,
and moreover, theoretically prove that optimizing such an objective essentially
forces the extra dimension to capture the marginal data distribution. Extensive
experiments show that our approach, Energy-based Open-World Softmax
(EOW-Softmax), is superior to existing state-of-the-art methods in improving

of spinal related diseases, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, degenerative cervical myelopathy and cancer. Automatic labeling of
the vertebral discs in MRI data is a difficult task because of the similarity
between discs and bone area, the variability in the geometry of the spine and
surrounding tissues across individuals, and the variability across scans
(manufacturers, pulse sequence, image contrast, resolution and artefacts). In
previous studies, vertebral disc labeling is often done after a disc detection
step and mostly fails when the localization algorithm misses discs or has false
positive detection. In this work, we aim to mitigate this problem by
reformulating the semantic vertebral disc labeling using the pose estimation
technique. To do so, we propose a stacked hourglass network with multi-level
attention mechanism to jointly learn intervertebral disc position and their
skeleton structure. The proposed deep learning model takes into account the
strength of semantic segmentation and pose estimation technique to handle the
missing area and false positive detection. To further improve the performance
of the proposed method, we propose a skeleton-based search space to reduce
false positive detection. The proposed method evaluated on spine generic public
multi-center dataset and demonstrated better performance comparing to previous
work, on both T1w and T2w contrasts. The method is implemented in ivadomed
(https://ivadomed.org).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we present a self-training method, named ST3D++, with a
holistic pseudo label denoising pipeline for unsupervised domain adaptation on
3D object detection. ST3D++ aims at reducing noise in pseudo label generation
as well as alleviating the negative impacts of noisy pseudo labels on model
training. First, ST3D++ pre-trains the 3D object detector on the labeled source
domain with random object scaling (ROS) which is designed to reduce target
domain pseudo label noise arising from object scale bias of the source domain.
Then, the detector is progressively improved through alternating between
generating pseudo labels and training the object detector with pseudo-labeled
target domain data. Here, we equip the pseudo label generation process with a
hybrid quality-aware triplet memory to improve the quality and stability of
generated pseudo labels. Meanwhile, in the model training stage, we propose a
source data assisted training strategy and a curriculum data augmentation
policy to effectively rectify noisy gradient directions and avoid model
over-fitting to noisy pseudo labeled data. These specific designs enable the
detector to be trained on meticulously refined pseudo labeled target data with
denoised training signals, and thus effectively facilitate adapting an object
detector to a target domain without requiring annotations. Finally, our method
is assessed on four 3D benchmark datasets (i.e., Waymo, KITTI, Lyft, and
nuScenes) for three common categories (i.e., car, pedestrian and bicycle).
ST3D++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on all evaluated settings,
outperforming the corresponding baseline by a large margin (e.g., 9.6% $\sim$
38.16% on Waymo $\rightarrow$ KITTI in terms of AP$_{\text{3D}}$), and even
surpasses the fully supervised oracle results on the KITTI 3D object detection
benchmark with target prior. Code will be available.]]></summary>

procedure. Due to its undecidability in general, a tool for invariant synthesis
necessarily uses heuristics. Despite the common belief that the design of
heuristics is vital for the effective performance of a verifier, little work
has been performed toward obtaining the optimal heuristics for each
invariant-synthesis tool. Instead, developers have hand-tuned the heuristics of
tools. This study demonstrates that we can effectively and automatically learn
a good heuristic via reinforcement learning for an invariant synthesizer PCSat.
Our experiment shows that PCSat combined with the heuristic learned by

the 360-degree sensors, but the vast majority of available semantic
segmentation training images are captured with pinhole cameras. In this work,
we look at this problem through the lens of domain adaptation and bring
panoramic semantic segmentation to a setting, where labelled training data
originates from a different distribution of conventional pinhole camera images.
First, we formalize the task of unsupervised domain adaptation for panoramic
semantic segmentation, where a network trained on labelled examples from the
source domain of pinhole camera data is deployed in a different target domain
of panoramic images, for which no labels are available. To validate this idea,
we collect and publicly release DensePASS - a novel densely annotated dataset
for panoramic segmentation under cross-domain conditions, specifically built to
study the Pinhole-to-Panoramic transfer and accompanied with pinhole camera
training examples obtained from Cityscapes. DensePASS covers both, labelled-
and unlabelled 360-degree images, with the labelled data comprising 19 classes
which explicitly fit the categories available in the source domain (i.e.
pinhole) data. To meet the challenge of domain shift, we leverage the current
progress of attention-based mechanisms and build a generic framework for
cross-domain panoramic semantic segmentation based on different variants of
attention-augmented domain adaptation modules. Our framework facilitates
information exchange at local- and global levels when learning the domain
correspondences and improves the domain adaptation performance of two standard
segmentation networks by 6.05% and 11.26% in Mean IoU.]]></summary>

along directions corresponding to the larger principal components of the data,
at a rate governed by the singular values. We term this convergence pattern the
Principal Components bias (PC-bias). We show how the PC-bias streamlines the

earlier stages of learning. We then compare our results to the simplicity bias,
showing that both biases can be seen independently, and affect the order of
learning in different ways. Finally, we discuss how the PC-bias may explain
some benefits of early stopping and its connection to PCA, and why deep
networks converge more slowly when given random labels.]]></summary>

model performance especially in insufficient or noisy data cases. (3) A

Model-level maps provide an understanding of what the entire DNN model focuses

and are widely deployed in many applications involving image, video, speech and
natural language processing. The increasing compute demands of DNNs have been
widely addressed through Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and specialized
accelerators. However, as model sizes grow, these von Neumann architectures
require very high memory bandwidth to keep the processing elements utilized as
a majority of the data resides in the main memory. Processing in memory has
been proposed as a promising solution for the memory wall bottleneck for ML
workloads. In this work, we propose a new DRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM)
multiplication primitive coupled with intra-bank accumulation to accelerate
matrix vector operations in ML workloads. The proposed multiplication primitive
adds < 1% area overhead and does not require any change in the DRAM
peripherals. Therefore, the proposed multiplication can be easily adopted in
commodity DRAM chips. Subsequently, we design a DRAM-based PIM architecture,
data mapping scheme and dataflow for executing DNNs within DRAM. System
evaluations performed on networks like AlexNet, VGG16 and ResNet18 show that
the proposed architecture, mapping, and data flow can provide up to 19.5x
speedup over an NVIDIA Titan Xp GPU highlighting the need to overcome the
memory bottleneck in future generations of DNN hardware.]]></summary>

locations to lead significant accuracy improvement in spatial interpolation by
using the prediction uncertainty of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) as
"attraction force" to deployed robots in path planning. Although the
integration with Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solvers was also shown to
produce relatively short travel distance, we here hypothesise several factors
that could decrease the overall prediction precision as well because
sub-optimal locations may eventually be included in their paths. To address
this issue, in this paper, we first explore "local planning" approaches
adopting various spatial ranges within which next sampling locations are
prioritized to investigate their effects on the prediction performance as well
as incurred travel distance. Also, Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based high-level
controllers are trained to adaptively produce blended plans from a particular
set of local planners to inherit unique strengths from that selection depending
on latest prediction states. Our experiments on use cases of temperature
monitoring robots demonstrate that the dynamic mixtures of planners can not
only generate sophisticated, informative plans that a single planner could not
create alone but also ensure significantly reduced travel distances at no cost
of prediction reliability without any assist of additional modules for shortest

(CSVD-QR) method for matrix complete problem is presented, whose computational
complexity is $O(r^2(m+n))$, which is mainly due to that $r$ is far less than
$\min\{m,n\}$, where $r$ represents the largest number of singular values of
matrix $X$. What is particularly interesting is that after replacing the
nuclear norm with the $L_{2,1}$ norm proposed based on this decomposition, as
the upper bound of the nuclear norm, when the intermediate matrix $D$ in its
decomposition is close to the diagonal matrix, it will converge to the nuclear
norm, and is exactly equal, when the $D$ matrix is equal to the diagonal
matrix, to the nuclear norm, which ingeniously avoids the calculation of the
singular value of the matrix. To the best of our knowledge, there is no
literature to generalize and apply it to solve tensor complete problems.
Inspired by this, in this paper we propose a class of tensor minimization model
based on $L_{2,1}$ norm and CSVD-QR method for the tensor complete problem,
which is convex and therefore has a global minimum solution.]]></summary>

objects/candidates, are increasingly prevalent in contexts such as political
elections, computer vision, recommender systems, and bioinformatics. The vote
counts for each ranking can be viewed as an n! data vector lying on the
permutahedron, which is a Cayley graph of the symmetric group with vertices
labeled by permutations and an edge when two permutations differ by an adjacent
transposition. Leveraging combinatorial representation theory and recent
progress in signal processing on graphs, we investigate a novel, scalable
transform method to interpret and exploit structure in ranked data. We
represent data on the permutahedron using an overcomplete dictionary of atoms,
each of which captures both smoothness information about the data (typically
the focus of spectral graph decomposition methods in graph signal processing)
and structural information about the data (typically the focus of symmetry
decomposition methods from representation theory). These atoms have a more
naturally interpretable structure than any known basis for signals on the
permutahedron, and they form a Parseval frame, ensuring beneficial numerical
properties such as energy preservation. We develop specialized algorithms and
open software that take advantage of the symmetry and structure of the
permutahedron to improve the scalability of the proposed method, making it more
applicable to the high-dimensional ranked data found in applications.]]></summary>

its impulse response (IR), a representation of how a full-range stimulus sound
excites it. This work generates an IR from a single image, which can then be

Joint-Domain Learning (JDL) as developed in this paper, and a state-of-the-art
domain general-ization approach Common-Specific Decomposition (CSD) from the
literature. First, we measured trans-ferability from a single external source.
Second, we used two external sources and evaluated whether domain
generalization can improve transferability of de-identification models across
domains which rep-resent different note types from the same institution. Third,
using two external sources with in-domain training data, we studied whether
external source data are useful even in cases where sufficient in-domain
training data are available. Finally, we investigated transferability of the
de-identification mod-els across institutions. Results and Conclusions: We
found transferability from a single external source gave inconsistent re-sults.
Using additional external sources consistently yielded an F1-score of
approximately 80%, but domain generalization was not always helpful to improve
transferability. We also found that external sources were useful even in cases
where in-domain training data were available by reducing the amount of needed
in-domain training data or by improving performance. Transferability across
institutions was differed by note type and annotation label. External sources
from a different institution were also useful to further improve performance.]]></summary>

pattern recognition, mainly due to similarity in structure of characters,
different handwriting styles, noisy datasets and a large variety of languages
and scripts. HCR problem is studied extensively for a few decades but there is
very limited research on script independent models. This is because of factors,
like, diversity of scripts, focus of the most of conventional research efforts
on handcrafted feature extraction techniques which are language/script specific
and are not always available, and unavailability of public datasets and codes
to reproduce the results. On the other hand, deep learning has witnessed huge
success in different areas of pattern recognition, including HCR, and provides
end-to-end learning, i.e., automated feature extraction and recognition. In
this paper, we have proposed a novel deep learning architecture which exploits
transfer learning and image-augmentation for end-to-end learning for script
independent handwritten character recognition, called HCR-Net. The network is
based on a novel transfer learning approach for HCR, where some of lower layers
of a pre-trained VGG16 network are utilised. Due to transfer learning and
image-augmentation, HCR-Net provides faster training, better performance and
better generalisations. The experimental results on publicly available datasets
of Bangla, Punjabi, Hindi, English, Swedish, Urdu, Farsi, Tibetan, Kannada,
Malayalam, Telugu, Marathi, Nepali and Arabic languages prove the efficacy of
HCR-Net and establishes several new benchmarks. For reproducibility of the
results and for the advancements of the HCR research, complete code is publicly

obtaining high-quality labeled data for those source domains themselves could
be difficult or costly. To address such challenges on data insufficiency for
classification problem in a target domain, we propose a weak adaptation
learning (WAL) approach that leverages unlabeled data from a similar source
domain, a low-cost weak annotator that produces labels based on task-specific
heuristics, labeling rules, or other methods (albeit with inaccuracy), and a
small amount of labeled data in the target domain. Our approach first conducts
a theoretical analysis on the error bound of the trained classifier with
respect to the data quantity and the performance of the weak annotator, and
then introduces a multi-stage weak adaptation learning method to learn an
accurate classifier by lowering the error bound. Our experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach in learning an accurate classifier with
limited labeled data in the target domain and unlabeled data in the source
domain.]]></summary>

using a greedy path-following algorithm. This simple algorithm is equivalent to
running a dynamical system, which we prove is stable for quantizing a
single-layer neural network (or, alternatively, for quantizing the first layer
of a multi-layer network) when the training data are Gaussian. We show that
under these assumptions, the quantization error decays with the width of the
layer, i.e., its level of over-parametrization. We provide numerical

graph-based recommender systems. Training GCN requires the minibatch generator
traversing graphs and sampling the sparsely located neighboring nodes to obtain
their features. Since real-world graphs often exceed the capacity of GPU
memory, current GCN training systems keep the feature table in host memory and
rely on the CPU to collect sparse features before sending them to the GPUs.
This approach, however, puts tremendous pressure on host memory bandwidth and
the CPU. This is because the CPU needs to (1) read sparse features from memory,
(2) write features into memory as a dense format, and (3) transfer the features
from memory to the GPUs. In this work, we propose a novel GPU-oriented data
communication approach for GCN training, where GPU threads directly access
sparse features in host memory through zero-copy accesses without much CPU
help. By removing the CPU gathering stage, our method significantly reduces the
consumption of the host resources and data access latency. We further present
two important techniques to achieve high host memory access efficiency by the
GPU: (1) automatic data access address alignment to maximize PCIe packet
efficiency, and (2) asynchronous zero-copy access and kernel execution to fully
overlap data transfer with training. We incorporate our method into PyTorch and
evaluate its effectiveness using several graphs with sizes up to 111 million
nodes and 1.6 billion edges. In a multi-GPU training setup, our method is
65-92% faster than the conventional data transfer method, and can even match
the performance of all-in-GPU-memory training for some graphs that fit in GPU
memory.]]></summary>

learning systems face accountability and fairness challenges due to
multi-stakeholder involvement and heterogeneity in client data distribution. To

present a blockchain-based trustworthy federated learning architecture. We
first design a smart contract-based data-model provenance registry to enable
accountability. Additionally, we propose a weighted fair data sampler algorithm
to enhance fairness in training data. We evaluate the proposed approach using a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unsupervised representation learning has achieved outstanding performances
using centralized data available on the Internet. However, the increasing
awareness of privacy protection limits sharing of decentralized unlabeled image
data that grows explosively in multiple parties (e.g., mobile phones and
cameras). As such, a natural problem is how to leverage these data to learn
visual representations for downstream tasks while preserving data privacy. To
address this problem, we propose a novel federated unsupervised learning
framework, FedU. In this framework, each party trains models from unlabeled
data independently using contrastive learning with an online network and a
target network. Then, a central server aggregates trained models and updates
clients' models with the aggregated model. It preserves data privacy as each
party only has access to its raw data. Decentralized data among multiple
parties are normally non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID),
leading to performance degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose two
simple but effective methods: 1) We design the communication protocol to upload
only the encoders of online networks for server aggregation and update them
with the aggregated encoder; 2) We introduce a new module to dynamically decide
how to update predictors based on the divergence caused by non-IID. The
predictor is the other component of the online network. Extensive experiments
and ablations demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of FedU. It
outperforms training with only one party by over 5% and other methods by over
14% in linear and semi-supervised evaluation on non-IID data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A central question in federated learning (FL) is how to design optimization
algorithms that minimize the communication cost of training a model over
heterogeneous data distributed across many clients. A popular technique for
reducing communication is the use of local steps, where clients take multiple
optimization steps over local data before communicating with the server (e.g.,
FedAvg, SCAFFOLD). This contrasts with centralized methods, where clients take
one optimization step per communication round (e.g., Minibatch SGD). A recent
lower bound on the communication complexity of first-order methods shows that
centralized methods are optimal over highly-heterogeneous data, whereas local
methods are optimal over purely homogeneous data [Woodworth et al., 2020]. For
intermediate heterogeneity levels, no algorithm is known to match the lower
bound. In this paper, we propose a multistage optimization scheme that nearly
matches the lower bound across all heterogeneity levels. The idea is to first
run a local method up to a heterogeneity-induced error floor; next, we switch
to a centralized method for the remaining steps. Our analysis may help explain
empirically-successful stepsize decay methods in FL [Charles et al., 2020;
Reddi et al., 2020]. We demonstrate the scheme's practical utility in image
classification tasks.]]></summary>

method to detect breast lesions in ultrafast DCE-MRI sequences. This method
uses both the three-dimensional spatial information and temporal information
obtained from the early-phase of the dynamic acquisition. Methods: The proposed
CADe method, based on a modified 3D RetinaNet model, operates on ultrafast T1
weighted sequences, which are preprocessed for motion compensation, temporal
normalization, and are cropped before passing into the model. The model is
optimized to enable the detection of relatively small breast lesions in a
screening setting, focusing on detection of lesions that are harder to
differentiate from confounding structures inside the breast. Results: The
method was developed based on a dataset consisting of 489 ultrafast MRI studies
obtained from 462 patients containing a total of 572 lesions (365 malignant,
207 benign) and achieved a detection rate, sensitivity, and detection rate of
benign lesions of 0.90 (0.876-0.934), 0.95 (0.934-0.980), and 0.81
(0.751-0.871) at 4 false positives per normal breast with 10-fold
cross-testing, respectively. Conclusions: The deep learning architecture used
for the proposed CADe application can efficiently detect benign and malignant
lesions on ultrafast DCE-MRI. Furthermore, utilizing the less visible hard-to
detect-lesions in training improves the learning process and, subsequently,
detection of malignant breast lesions.]]></summary>

unlabeled image collections. Unlike existing approaches that attempt to learn
useful features by maximizing similarity between augmented versions of each

use of the natural variation that occurs in image collections that are captured
using static monitoring cameras. To achieve this, we exploit readily available
context data that encodes information such as the spatial and temporal
relationships between the input images. We are able to learn representations
that are surprisingly effective for downstream supervised classification, by
first identifying high probability positive pairs at training time, i.e. those
images that are likely to depict the same visual concept. For the critical task
of global biodiversity monitoring, this results in image features that can be
adapted to challenging visual species classification tasks with limited human
supervision. We present results on four different camera trap image
collections, across three different families of self-supervised learning
methods, and show that careful image selection at training time results in
superior performance compared to existing baselines such as conventional
self-supervised training and transfer learning.]]></summary>

well-written sources. However, in intelligent voice assistants, where NER is an
important component, input to NER may be noisy because of user or speech
recognition error. In applications, entity labels may change frequently, and
non-textual properties like topicality or popularity may be needed to choose
among alternatives.

We describe a NER system intended to address these problems. We test and
train this system on a proprietary user-derived dataset. We compare with a
baseline text-only NER system; the baseline enhanced with external gazetteers;
and the baseline enhanced with the search and indirect labelling techniques we
describe below. The final configuration gives around 6% reduction in NER error
rate. We also show that this technique improves related tasks, such as semantic

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning research has recently witnessed an impressively fast-paced
progress in a wide range of tasks including computer vision, natural language
processing, and reinforcement learning. The extraordinary performance of these
systems often gives the impression that they can be used to revolutionise our
lives for the better. However, as recent works point out, these systems suffer
from several issues that make them unreliable for use in the real world,
including vulnerability to adversarial attacks (Szegedy et al. [248]), tendency
to memorise noise (Zhang et al. [292]), being over-confident on incorrect
predictions (miscalibration) (Guo et al. [99]), and unsuitability for handling
private data (Gilad-Bachrach et al. [88]). In this thesis, we look at each of
these issues in detail, investigate their causes, and propose computationally
cheap algorithms for mitigating them in practice. To do this, we identify
structures in deep neural networks that can be exploited to mitigate the above
causes of unreliability of deep learning algorithms.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modeling inter-dependencies between time-series is the key to achieve high
performance in anomaly detection for multivariate time-series data. The
de-facto solution to model the dependencies is to feed the data into a
recurrent neural network (RNN). However, the fully connected network structure
underneath the RNN (either GRU or LSTM) assumes a static and complete
dependency graph between time-series, which may not hold in many real-world
applications. To alleviate this assumption, we propose a dynamic bipartite
graph structure to encode the inter-dependencies between time-series. More
concretely, we model time series as one type of nodes, and the time series
segments (regarded as event) as another type of nodes, where the edge between
two types of nodes describe a temporal pattern occurred on a specific time
series at a certain time. Based on this design, relations between time series
can be explicitly modelled via dynamic connections to event nodes, and the
multivariate time-series anomaly detection problem can be formulated as a
self-supervised, edge stream prediction problem in dynamic graphs. We conducted
extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the design.]]></summary>

widely considered to be related to adversarial robustness, we theoretically
characterize the $\ell_1$ norm and $\ell_\infty$ norm of 2D multi-channel
convolutional layers and provide efficient methods to compute the exact
$\ell_1$ norm and $\ell_\infty$ norm. Based on our theorem, we propose a novel
regularization method termed norm decay, which can effectively reduce the norms
of convolutional layers and fully-connected layers. Experiments show that
norm-regularization methods, including norm decay, weight decay, and singular
value clipping, can improve generalization of CNNs. However, they can slightly
hurt adversarial robustness. Observing this unexpected phenomenon, we compute
the norms of layers in the CNNs trained with three different adversarial
training frameworks and surprisingly find that adversarially robust CNNs have
comparable or even larger layer norms than their non-adversarially robust
counterparts. Furthermore, we prove that under a mild assumption, adversarially
robust classifiers can be achieved using neural networks, and an adversarially
robust neural network can have an arbitrarily large Lipschitz constant. For
this reason, enforcing small norms on CNN layers may be neither necessary nor
effective in achieving adversarial robustness. The code is available at

pruning), which slims down a CNN by reducing the width (number of output
channels) of convolutional layers. Inspired by the neurobiology research about
the independence of remembering and forgetting, we propose to re-parameterize a
CNN into the remembering parts and forgetting parts, where the former learn to
maintain the performance and the latter learn to prune. Via training with
regular SGD on the former but a novel update rule with penalty gradients on the
latter, we realize structured sparsity. Then we equivalently merge the
remembering and forgetting parts into the original architecture with narrower
layers. In this sense, ResRep can be viewed as a successful application of
Structural Re-parameterization. Such a methodology distinguishes ResRep from
the traditional learning-based pruning paradigm that applies a penalty on
parameters to produce sparsity, which may suppress the parameters essential for
the remembering. ResRep slims down a standard ResNet-50 with 76.15% accuracy on
ImageNet to a narrower one with only 45% FLOPs and no accuracy drop, which is
the first to achieve lossless pruning with such a high compression ratio. The

outstanding results in many applications. Generative Adversarial Networks are
powerful yet, resource-hungry deep-learning models. Their main difference from
ordinary deep learning models is the nature of their output. For example, GAN
output can be a whole image versus other models detecting objects or
classifying images. Thus, the architecture and numeric precision of the network
affect the quality and speed of the solution. Hence, accelerating GANs is
pivotal. Accelerating GANs can be classified into three main tracks: (1) Memory
compression, (2) Computation optimization, and (3) Data-flow optimization.
Because data transfer is the main source of energy usage, memory compression
leads to the most savings. Thus, in this paper, we survey memory compression
techniques for CNN-Based GANs. Additionally, the paper summarizes opportunities
and challenges in GANs acceleration and suggests open research problems to be
further investigated.]]></summary>

make predictions on data whose distribution changes gradually along time,
leading to a drift between the train and test distributions. Such models are
often re-trained on new data periodically, and they hence need to generalize to
data not too far into the future. In this context, there is much prior work on
enhancing temporal generalization, e.g. continuous transportation of past data,
kernel smoothed time-sensitive parameters and more recently, adversarial
learning of time-invariant features. However, these methods share several
limitations, e.g, poor scalability, training instability, and dependence on
unlabeled data from the future. Responding to the above limitations, we propose
a simple method that starts with a model with time-sensitive parameters but
regularizes its temporal complexity using a Gradient Interpolation (GI) loss.
GI allows the decision boundary to change along time and can still prevent
overfitting to the limited training time snapshots by allowing task-specific
control over changes along time. We compare our method to existing baselines on
multiple real-world datasets, which show that GI outperforms more complicated
generative and adversarial approaches on the one hand, and simpler gradient
regularization methods on the other.]]></summary>

learning models get deployed as a service, where the training data distribution
is hidden from clients, and different clients may be interested in diverse

surface. Each attribute combination, called an 'arm', is associated with a Beta
density from which the service's accuracy is sampled. We expect the GP to
smooth the parameters of the Beta density over related arms to mitigate
sparsity. We show that obvious application of GPs cannot address the challenge
of heteroscedastic uncertainty over a huge attribute space that is sparsely and
unevenly populated. In response, we present two enhancements: pooling sparse

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The focus of this paper is on stochastic variational inequalities (VI) under
Markovian noise. A prominent application of our algorithmic developments is the
stochastic policy evaluation problem in reinforcement learning. Prior
investigations in the literature focused on temporal difference (TD) learning
by employing nonsmooth finite time analysis motivated by stochastic subgradient
descent leading to certain limitations. These encompass the requirement of
analyzing a modified TD algorithm that involves projection to an a-priori
defined Euclidean ball, achieving a non-optimal convergence rate and no clear
way of deriving the beneficial effects of parallel implementation. Our approach
remedies these shortcomings in the broader context of stochastic VIs and in
particular when it comes to stochastic policy evaluation. We developed a
variety of simple TD learning type algorithms motivated by its original version
that maintain its simplicity, while offering distinct advantages from a
non-asymptotic analysis point of view. We first provide an improved analysis of
the standard TD algorithm that can benefit from parallel implementation. Then
we present versions of a conditional TD algorithm (CTD), that involves periodic
updates of the stochastic iterates, which reduce the bias and therefore exhibit
improved iteration complexity. This brings us to the fast TD (FTD) algorithm
which combines elements of CTD and the stochastic operator extrapolation method
of the companion paper. For a novel index resetting policy FTD exhibits the
best known convergence rate. We also devised a robust version of the algorithm
that is particularly suitable for discounting factors close to 1.]]></summary>

learning applications. One of these situations is the post-earthquake regional
damage assessment of buildings. Querying the damage label of each building
requires a thorough inspection by experts, and thus, is an expensive task. A
practical approach is to sample the most informative buildings in a sequential
learning scheme. Active learning methods recommend the most informative cases
that are able to maximally reduce the generalization error. The information
theoretic measure of mutual information (MI) is one of the most effective
criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of the samples in a pool-based sample
selection scenario. However, the computational complexity of the standard MI
algorithm prevents the utilization of this method on large datasets. A local
kernels strategy was proposed to reduce the computational costs, but the
adaptability of the kernels to the observed labels was not considered in the
original formulation of this strategy. In this article, an adaptive local
kernels methodology is developed that allows for the conformability of the
kernels to the observed output data while enhancing the computational
complexity of the standard MI algorithm. The proposed algorithm is developed to
work on a Gaussian process regression (GPR) framework, where the kernel
hyperparameters are updated after each label query using the maximum likelihood
estimation. In the sequential learning procedure, the updated hyperparameters
can be used in the MI kernel matrices to improve the sample suggestion
performance. The advantages are demonstrated on a simulation of the 2018
Anchorage, AK, earthquake. It is shown that while the proposed algorithm
enables GPR to reach acceptable performance with fewer training data, the
computational demands remain lower than the standard local kernels strategy.]]></summary>

(CNN) image features to generate captions via recurrent models. Recently, image
scene graphs have been used to augment captioning models so as to leverage
their structural semantics, such as object entities, relationships and
attributes. Several studies have noted that the naive use of scene graphs from
a black-box scene graph generator harms image captioning performance and that
scene graph-based captioning models have to incur the overhead of explicit use
of image features to generate decent captions. Addressing these challenges, we
propose \textbf{SG2Caps}, a framework that utilizes only the scene graph labels
for competitive image captioning performance. The basic idea is to close the
semantic gap between the two scene graphs - one derived from the input image
and the other from its caption. In order to achieve this, we leverage the
spatial location of objects and the Human-Object-Interaction (HOI) labels as an
additional HOI graph. SG2Caps outperforms existing scene graph-only captioning
models by a large margin, indicating scene graphs as a promising representation
for image captioning. Direct utilization of scene graph labels avoids expensive
graph convolutions over high-dimensional CNN features resulting in 49% fewer
trainable parameters. Our code is available at:

capable of using multi-relational domain knowledge. The technique is based on
mode-directed inverse entailment (MDIE) developed in Inductive Logic
Programming (ILP). Given a data instance $e$ and background knowledge $B$, MDIE
identifies a most-specific logical formula $\bot_B(e)$ that contains all the
relational information in $B$ that is related to $e$. We represent $\bot_B(e)$
by a "bottom-graph" that can be converted into a form suitable for GNN
implementations. This transformation allows a principled way of incorporating
generic background knowledge into GNNs: we use the term `BotGNN' for this form
of graph neural networks. For several GNN variants, using real-world datasets
with substantial background knowledge, we show that BotGNNs perform
significantly better than both GNNs without background knowledge and a recently
proposed simplified technique for including domain knowledge into GNNs. We also
provide experimental evidence comparing BotGNNs favourably to multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) that use features representing a "propositionalised" form of
the background knowledge; and BotGNNs to a standard ILP based on the use of
most-specific clauses. Taken together, these results point to BotGNNs as
capable of combining the computational efficacy of GNNs with the

with the recent success of self-supervised contrastive learning methods.
Supervised contrastive learning has also been shown to outperform its
cross-entropy counterparts by leveraging labels for choosing where to contrast.
However, there has been little work to explore the transfer capability of
contrastive learning to a different domain. In this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the transferability of learned representations of
different contrastive approaches for linear evaluation, full-network transfer,
and few-shot recognition on 12 downstream datasets from different domains, and
object detection tasks on MSCOCO and VOC0712. The results show that the
contrastive approaches learn representations that are easily transferable to a
different downstream task. We further observe that the joint objective of
self-supervised contrastive loss with cross-entropy/supervised-contrastive loss
leads to better transferability of these models over their supervised
counterparts. Our analysis reveals that the representations learned from the
contrastive approaches contain more low/mid-level semantics than cross-entropy
models, which enables them to quickly adapt to a new task. Our codes and models
will be publicly available to facilitate future research on transferability of
visual representations.]]></summary>

methods. In some target problem domains, there are not many data samples

a theoretical analysis on the error bound of the trained classifier with

of attacks, such as adversarial attack, data poisoning attack and backdoor
attack. Among them, backdoor attack is the most cunning one and can occur in
almost every stage of deep learning pipeline. Therefore, backdoor attack has
attracted lots of interests from both academia and industry. However, most
existing backdoor attack methods are either visible or fragile to some
effortless pre-processing such as common data transformations. To address these
limitations, we propose a robust and invisible backdoor attack called "Poison
Ink". Concretely, we first leverage the image structures as target poisoning
areas, and fill them with poison ink (information) to generate the trigger
pattern. As the image structure can keep its semantic meaning during the data
transformation, such trigger pattern is inherently robust to data
transformations. Then we leverage a deep injection network to embed such
trigger pattern into the cover image to achieve stealthiness. Compared to
existing popular backdoor attack methods, Poison Ink outperforms both in
stealthiness and robustness. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate
Poison Ink is not only general to different datasets and network architectures,
but also flexible for different attack scenarios. Besides, it also has very
strong resistance against many state-of-the-art defense techniques.]]></summary>

devices by recognizing status and intention of humans. Communication between
humans and a drone using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is one of the most
challenging issues in the BCI domain. In particular, the control of drone
swarms (the direction and formation) has more advantages compared to the
control of a drone. The visual imagery (VI) paradigm is that subjects visually
imagine specific objects or scenes. Reduction of the variability among EEG
signals of subjects is essential for practical BCI-based systems. In this
study, we proposed the subepoch-wise feature encoder (SEFE) to improve the
performances in the subject-independent tasks by using the VI dataset. This
study is the first attempt to demonstrate the possibility of generalization
among subjects in the VI-based BCI. We used the leave-one-subject-out
cross-validation for evaluating the performances. We obtained higher
performances when including our proposed module than excluding our proposed
module. The DeepConvNet with SEFE showed the highest performance of 0.72 among
six different decoding models. Hence, we demonstrated the feasibility of
decoding the VI dataset in the subject-independent task with robust

partition a network into multiple sub-structures to help reveal their latent
functions. Community detection has been extensively studied in and broadly
applied to many real-world network problems. Classical approaches to community
detection typically utilize probabilistic graphical models and adopt a variety
of prior knowledge to infer community structures. As the problems that network
methods try to solve and the network data to be analyzed become increasingly
more sophisticated, new approaches have also been proposed and developed,
particularly those that utilize deep learning and convert networked data into
low dimensional representation. Despite all the recent advancement, there is
still a lack of insightful understanding of the theoretical and methodological
underpinning of community detection, which will be critically important for
future development of the area of network analysis. In this paper, we develop
and present a unified architecture of network community-finding methods to
characterize the state-of-the-art of the field of community detection.
Specifically, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing community
detection methods and introduce a new taxonomy that divides the existing
methods into two categories, namely probabilistic graphical model and deep
learning. We then discuss in detail the main idea behind each method in the two
categories. Furthermore, to promote future development of community detection,
we release several benchmark datasets from several problem domains and
highlight their applications to various network analysis tasks. We conclude
with discussions of the challenges of the field and suggestions of possible
directions for future research.]]></summary>

the current state-of-the-art still suffers from common real-world challenges
such as appearance similarity among various people, occlusions, and frame
misalignment. To alleviate these problems, we propose Spatio-Temporal
Representation Factorization (STRF), a flexible new computational unit that can
be used in conjunction with most existing 3D convolutional neural network
architectures for re-ID. The key innovations of STRF over prior work include
explicit pathways for learning discriminative temporal and spatial features,
with each component further factorized to capture complementary person-specific
appearance and motion information. Specifically, temporal factorization
comprises two branches, one each for static features (e.g., the color of
clothes) that do not change much over time, and dynamic features (e.g., walking
patterns) that change over time. Further, spatial factorization also comprises
two branches to learn both global (coarse segments) as well as local (finer
segments) appearance features, with the local features particularly useful in
cases of occlusion or spatial misalignment. These two factorization operations
taken together result in a modular architecture for our parameter-wise light
STRF unit that can be plugged in between any two 3D convolutional layers,
resulting in an end-to-end learning framework. We empirically show that STRF
improves performance of various existing baseline architectures while
demonstrating new state-of-the-art results using standard person re-ID
evaluation protocols on three benchmarks.]]></summary>

learning a mapping from a source domain to a target domain with unpaired image
data. Though the existing methods have achieved promising results, they still
produce visual artifacts, being able to translate low-level information but not
high-level semantics of input images. One possible reason is that generators do
not have the ability to perceive the most discriminative parts between the
source and target domains, thus making the generated images low quality. In
this paper, we propose a new Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Networks
(AttentionGAN) for the unpaired image-to-image translation task. AttentionGAN
can identify the most discriminative foreground objects and minimize the change
of the background. The attention-guided generators in AttentionGAN are able to
produce attention masks, and then fuse the generation output with the attention
masks to obtain high-quality target images. Accordingly, we also design a novel
attention-guided discriminator which only considers attended regions. Extensive
experiments are conducted on several generative tasks with eight public
datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method is effective to generate
sharper and more realistic images compared with existing competitive models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Knowledge distillation (KD) is a popular method to train efficient networks
("student") with the help of high-capacity networks ("teacher"). Traditional
methods use the teacher's soft logits as extra supervision to train the student
network. In this paper, we argue that it is more advantageous to make the
student mimic the teacher's features in the penultimate layer. Not only the
student can directly learn more effective information from the teacher feature,
feature mimicking can also be applied for teachers trained without a softmax
layer. Experiments show that it can achieve higher accuracy than traditional
KD. To further facilitate feature mimicking, we decompose a feature vector into
the magnitude and the direction. We argue that the teacher should give more
freedom to the student feature's magnitude, and let the student pay more
attention on mimicking the feature direction. To meet this requirement, we
propose a loss term based on locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). With the help of
this new loss, our method indeed mimics feature directions more accurately,
relaxes constraints on feature magnitudes, and achieves state-of-the-art
distillation accuracy. We provide theoretical analyses of how LSH facilitates
feature direction mimicking, and further extend feature mimicking to
multi-label recognition and object detection.]]></summary>

made by machine learning systems. However, discriminative classifiers based on
deep neural networks are often criticized for producing overconfident
predictions that fail to reflect the true correctness likelihood of

is mainly caused by the closed-world nature in softmax: a model trained by the
cross-entropy loss will be forced to classify input into one of $K$ pre-defined
categories with high probability. To address this problem, we for the first
time propose a novel $K$+1-way softmax formulation, which incorporates the
modeling of open-world uncertainty as the extra dimension. To unify the
learning of the original $K$-way classification task and the extra dimension
that models uncertainty, we propose a novel energy-based objective function,
and moreover, theoretically prove that optimizing such an objective essentially
forces the extra dimension to capture the marginal data distribution. Extensive

for the $k$-shot scenario, we propose a novel image quality measurement module
to select images from the set of support images. A high-quality class prototype
could be obtained with the weighted sum of support image features based on the
quality measure. Experiments on both PASCAL-$5^i$ and COCO dataset shows that
our proposed method is able to achieve state-of-the-art results in both 1-shot
and 5-shot settings. Particularly, our proposed MM-Net achieves 37.5\% mIoU on
the COCO dataset in 1-shot setting, which is 5.1\% higher than the previous
state-of-the-art.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gait recognition is one of the most important biometric technologies and has
been applied in many fields. Recent gait recognition frameworks represent each
gait frame by descriptors extracted from either global appearances or local
regions of humans. However, the representations based on global information
often neglect the details of the gait frame, while local region based
descriptors cannot capture the relations among neighboring regions, thus
reducing their discriminativeness. In this paper, we propose a novel feature
extraction and fusion framework to achieve discriminative feature
representations for gait recognition. Towards this goal, we take advantage of
both global visual information and local region details and develop a Global
and Local Feature Extractor (GLFE). Specifically, our GLFE module is composed
of our newly designed multiple global and local convolutional layers (GLConv)
to ensemble global and local features in a principle manner. Furthermore, we
present a novel operation, namely Local Temporal Aggregation (LTA), to further
preserve the spatial information by reducing the temporal resolution to obtain
higher spatial resolution. With the help of our GLFE and LTA, our method
significantly improves the discriminativeness of our visual features, thus
improving the gait recognition performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art gait recognition methods
on two popular datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Knowledge distillation (KD) is a popular method to train efficient networks
("student") with the help of high-capacity networks ("teacher"). Traditional
methods use the teacher's soft logits as extra supervision to train the student
network. In this paper, we argue that it is more advantageous to make the
student mimic the teacher's features in the penultimate layer. Not only the
student can directly learn more effective information from the teacher feature,
feature mimicking can also be applied for teachers trained without a softmax
layer. Experiments show that it can achieve higher accuracy than traditional
KD. To further facilitate feature mimicking, we decompose a feature vector into
the magnitude and the direction. We argue that the teacher should give more
freedom to the student feature's magnitude, and let the student pay more
attention on mimicking the feature direction. To meet this requirement, we
propose a loss term based on locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). With the help of
this new loss, our method indeed mimics feature directions more accurately,
relaxes constraints on feature magnitudes, and achieves state-of-the-art
distillation accuracy. We provide theoretical analyses of how LSH facilitates
feature direction mimicking, and further extend feature mimicking to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper tackles the task of category-level pose estimation for garments.
With a near infinite degree of freedom, a garment's full configuration (i.e.,
poses) is often described by the per-vertex 3D locations of its entire 3D
surface. However, garments are also commonly subject to extreme cases of
self-occlusion, especially when folded or crumpled, making it challenging to
perceive their full 3D surface. To address these challenges, we propose
GarmentNets, where the key idea is to formulate the deformable object pose
estimation problem as a shape completion task in the canonical space. This
canonical space is defined across garments instances within a category,
therefore, specifies the shared category-level pose. By mapping the observed
partial surface to the canonical space and completing it in this space, the
output representation describes the garment's full configuration using a
complete 3D mesh with the per-vertex canonical coordinate label. To properly
handle the thin 3D structure presented on garments, we proposed a novel 3D
shape representation using the generalized winding number field. Experiments
demonstrate that GarmentNets is able to generalize to unseen garment instances
and achieve significantly better performance compared to alternative
approaches.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polynomial expansions are important in the analysis of neural network
nonlinearities. They have been applied thereto addressing well-known
difficulties in verification, explainability, and security. Existing approaches
span classical Taylor and Chebyshev methods, asymptotics, and many numerical
approaches. We find that while these individually have useful properties such
as exact error formulas, adjustable domain, and robustness to undefined
derivatives, there are no approaches that provide a consistent method yielding
an expansion with all these properties. To address this, we develop an
analytically modified integral transform expansion (AMITE), a novel expansion
via integral transforms modified using derived criteria for convergence. We
show the general expansion and then demonstrate application for two popular
activation functions, hyperbolic tangent and rectified linear units. Compared
with existing expansions (i.e., Chebyshev, Taylor, and numerical) employed to
this end, AMITE is the first to provide six previously mutually exclusive
desired expansion properties such as exact formulas for the coefficients and
exact expansion errors (Table II). We demonstrate the effectiveness of AMITE in
two case studies. First, a multivariate polynomial form is efficiently
extracted from a single hidden layer black-box MLP to facilitate equivalence
testing from noisy stimulus-response pairs. Second, a variety of FFNN
architectures having between 3 and 7 layers are range bounded using Taylor
models improved by the AMITE polynomials and error formulas. AMITE presents a
new dimension of expansion methods suitable for analysis/approximation of
nonlinearities in neural networks, opening new directions and opportunities for

of the present results are either perceptually unsatisfactory or ineffective

can be concealed without sacrificing the visual quality. Extensive experiments

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: Underwater images, in general, suffer from low contrast and high
color distortions due to the non-uniform attenuation of the light as it
propagates through the water. In addition, the degree of attenuation varies
with the wavelength resulting in the asymmetric traversing of colors. Despite
the prolific works for underwater image restoration (UIR) using deep learning,
the above asymmetricity has not been addressed in the respective network
engineering.

Contributions: As the first novelty, this paper shows that attributing the
right receptive field size (context) based on the traversing range of the color
channel may lead to a substantial performance gain for the task of UIR.
Further, it is important to suppress the irrelevant multi-contextual features
and increase the representational power of the model. Therefore, as a second
novelty, we have incorporated an attentive skip mechanism to adaptively refine
the learned multi-contextual features. The proposed framework, called Deep
WaveNet, is optimized using the traditional pixel-wise and feature-based cost
functions. An extensive set of experiments have been carried out to show the
efficacy of the proposed scheme over existing best-published literature on
benchmark datasets. More importantly, we have demonstrated a comprehensive
validation of enhanced images across various high-level vision tasks, e.g.,
underwater image semantic segmentation, and diver's 2D pose estimation. A
sample video to exhibit our real-world performance is available at

leveraging a hybrid approach that benefits from Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and self-attention mechanism in Transformers to extract both local and
non-local features from the input image. We capture local structure information
of the image via CNNs, then to circumvent the locality bias among the extracted
CNNs features and obtain a non-local representation of the image, we utilize
Transformers on the extracted features where we model them as a sequential
input to the Transformer model. Furthermore, to improve the monotonicity
correlation between the subjective and objective scores, we utilize the
relative distance information among the images within each batch and enforce
the relative ranking among them. Last but not least, we observe that the
performance of NR-IQA models degrades when we apply equivariant transformations
(e.g. horizontal flipping) to the inputs. Therefore, we propose a method that
leverages self-consistency as a source of self-supervision to improve the
robustness of NRIQA models. Specifically, we enforce self-consistency between
the outputs of our quality assessment model for each image and its

family that drew attention due to its unique ability to maintain the
equivariance property by preserving the spatial relationship amongst the
features. The capsule network has attained unprecedented success over image
classification tasks with datasets such as MNIST and affNIST by encoding the
characteristic features into the capsules and building the parse-tree
structure. However, on the datasets involving complex foreground and background
regions such as CIFAR-10, the performance of the capsule network is sub-optimal
due to its naive data routing policy and incompetence towards extracting
complex features. This paper proposes a new design strategy for capsule network
architecture for efficiently dealing with complex images. The proposed method
incorporates wide bottleneck residual modules and the Squeeze and Excitation
attention blocks upheld by the modified FM routing algorithm to address the
defined problem. A wide bottleneck residual module facilitates extracting
complex features followed by the squeeze and excitation attention block to
enable channel-wise attention by suppressing the trivial features. This setup
allows channel inter-dependencies at almost no computational cost, thereby
enhancing the representation ability of capsules on complex images. We
extensively evaluate the performance of the proposed model on three publicly

over supervised learning. The benefits of no need for ground-truth depth,
online fine-tuning, and better generalization with unlimited data attract
researchers to seek self-supervised solutions. In this work, we propose a new
self-supervised framework for stereo matching utilizing multiple images
captured at aligned camera positions. A cross photometric loss, an
uncertainty-aware mutual-supervision loss, and a new smoothness loss are
introduced to optimize the network in learning disparity maps end-to-end
without ground-truth depth information. To train this framework, we build a new
multiscopic dataset consisting of synthetic images rendered by 3D engines and
real images captured by real cameras. After being trained with only the
synthetic images, our network can perform well in unseen outdoor scenes. Our
experiment shows that our model obtains better disparity maps than previous
unsupervised methods on the KITTI dataset and is comparable to supervised
methods when generalized to unseen data. Our source code and dataset are

By encouraging dimension-wise sparsity in the transformer, important dimensions
automatically emerge. A great number of dimensions with small importance scores
can be discarded to achieve a high pruning ratio without significantly
compromising accuracy. The pipeline for vision transformer pruning is as
follows: 1) training with sparsity regularization; 2) pruning dimensions of

regression of the target object based on the similarity maps. However, they
either employ a single map from the last convolutional layer which degrades the
localization accuracy in complex scenarios or separately use multiple maps for
decision making, introducing intractable computations for aerial mobile
platforms. Thus, in this work, we propose an efficient and effective
hierarchical feature transformer (HiFT) for aerial tracking. Hierarchical
similarity maps generated by multi-level convolutional layers are fed into the
feature transformer to achieve the interactive fusion of spatial (shallow
layers) and semantics cues (deep layers). Consequently, not only the global
contextual information can be raised, facilitating the target search, but also
our end-to-end architecture with the transformer can efficiently learn the
interdependencies among multi-level features, thereby discovering a
tracking-tailored feature space with strong discriminability. Comprehensive
evaluations on four aerial benchmarks have proven the effectiveness of HiFT.
Real-world tests on the aerial platform have strongly validated its
practicability with a real-time speed. Our code is available at

efficiency in characterizing both the complex structure and relationship

shortcomings: (1) They are inefficient or even fail for graph learning in large

well exploit both the complementary information and spatial structure embedded
in graphs of different views. To well exploit complementary information and
tackle the scalability issue plaguing graph-based multi-view clustering, we
propose an efficient multiple graph learning model via a small number of anchor

hidden and tractable large graph by anchor graph for each view and well exploit
complementary information embedded in anchor graphs of different views by
tensor Schatten p-norm regularizer. Finally, we develop an efficient algorithm,
which scales linearly with the data size, to solve our proposed model.

identify the information accumulated in training. The algorithm dynamically
scales channel sizes up or down over a fixed searching phase. We conduct

registration algorithms plays an important role in the safe deployment of
real-world medical applications and research-oriented processing pipelines, and
in improving generalization capabilities. Currently available approaches for
uncertainty estimation, including the variational encoder-decoder architecture
and the inference-time dropout approach, require specific network architectures
and assume parametric distribution of the latent space which may result in
sub-optimal characterization of the posterior distribution for the predicted
deformation-fields. We introduce the NPBDREG, a fully non-parametric Bayesian
framework for unsupervised DNN-based deformable image registration by combining
an \texttt{Adam} optimizer with stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) to
characterize the true posterior distribution through posterior sampling. The
NPBDREG provides a principled non-parametric way to characterize the true
posterior distribution, thus providing improved uncertainty estimates and
confidence measures in a theoretically well-founded and computationally
efficient way. We demonstrated the added-value of NPBDREG, compared to the
baseline probabilistic \texttt{VoxelMorph} unsupervised model (PrVXM), on brain
MRI images registration using $390$ image pairs from four publicly available
databases: MGH10, CMUC12, ISBR18 and LPBA40. The NPBDREG shows a slight
improvement in the registration accuracy compared to PrVXM (Dice score of
$0.73$ vs. $0.68$, $p \ll 0.01$), a better generalization capability for data
corrupted by a mixed structure noise (e.g Dice score of $0.729$ vs. $0.686$ for
$\alpha=0.2$) and last but foremost, a significantly better correlation of the
predicted uncertainty with out-of-distribution data ($r>0.95$ vs. $r<0.5$).]]></summary>

the large number of possible text appearances in natural scenes. Most STR
models rely on synthetic datasets for training since there are no sufficiently
big and publicly available labelled real datasets. Since STR models are
evaluated using real data, the mismatch between training and testing data
distributions results into poor performance of models especially on challenging
text that are affected by noise, artifacts, geometry, structure, etc. In this
paper, we introduce STRAug which is made of 36 image augmentation functions
designed for STR. Each function mimics certain text image properties that can
be found in natural scenes, caused by camera sensors, or induced by signal
processing operations but poorly represented in the training dataset. When
applied to strong baseline models using RandAugment, STRAug significantly
increases the overall absolute accuracy of STR models across regular and
irregular test datasets by as much as 2.10% on Rosetta, 1.48% on R2AM, 1.30% on

the cost of heavy computation. Recent works make use of deep neural networks to
accelerate this process, by improving either low-resolution or fewer-sample
rendering with super-resolution or denoising neural networks in
post-processing. However, denoising and super-resolution have only been
considered separately in previous work. We show in this work that Monte Carlo
path tracing can be further accelerated by joint super-resolution and denoising
(SRD) in post-processing. This new type of joint filtering allows only a
low-resolution and fewer-sample (thus noisy) image to be rendered by path
tracing, which is then fed into a deep neural network to produce a
high-resolution and clean image. The main contribution of this work is a new
end-to-end network architecture, specifically designed for the SRD task. It
contains two cascaded stages with shared components. We discover that denoising
and super-resolution require very different receptive fields, a key insight
that leads to the introduction of deformable convolution into the network
design. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms

fabric defect detection, which come with the cost of expensive training and
complex model parameters. With the observation that most fabrics are defect
free in practice, a two-step Cascaded Zoom-In Network (CZI-Net) is proposed for
patterned fabric defect detection. In the CZI-Net, the Aggregated HOG (A-HOG)
and SIFT features are used to instead of simple convolution filters for feature
extraction. Moreover, in order to extract more distinctive features, the
feature representation layer and full connection layer are included in the
CZI-Net. In practice, Most defect-free fabrics only involve in the first step
of our method and avoid a costive computation in the second step, which makes
very fast fabric detection. More importantly, we propose the
Locality-constrained Reconstruction Error (LCRE) in the first step and
Restrictive Locality-constrained Coding (RLC), Bag-of-Indexes (BoI) methods in
the second step. We also analyse the connections between different coding
methods and conclude that the index of visual words plays an essential role in
the coding methods. In conclusion, experiments based on real-world datasets are

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We address the problem of generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation (GZS3)
predicting pixel-wise semantic labels for seen and unseen classes. Most GZS3
methods adopt a generative approach that synthesizes visual features of unseen
classes from corresponding semantic ones (e.g., word2vec) to train novel
classifiers for both seen and unseen classes. Although generative methods show
decent performance, they have two limitations: (1) the visual features are
biased towards seen classes; (2) the classifier should be retrained whenever
novel unseen classes appear. We propose a discriminative approach to address
these limitations in a unified framework. To this end, we leverage visual and
semantic encoders to learn a joint embedding space, where the semantic encoder
transforms semantic features to semantic prototypes that act as centers for
visual features of corresponding classes. Specifically, we introduce
boundary-aware regression (BAR) and semantic consistency (SC) losses to learn
discriminative features. Our approach to exploiting the joint embedding space,
together with BAR and SC terms, alleviates the seen bias problem. At test time,
we avoid the retraining process by exploiting semantic prototypes as a
nearest-neighbor (NN) classifier. To further alleviate the bias problem, we
also propose an inference technique, dubbed Apollonius calibration (AC), that
modulates the decision boundary of the NN classifier to the Apollonius circle
adaptively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework, achieving a new state of the art on standard benchmarks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adversarial domain adaptation has made impressive advances in transferring
knowledge from the source domain to the target domain by aligning feature
distributions of both domains. These methods focus on minimizing domain
divergence and regard the adaptability, which is measured as the expected error
of the ideal joint hypothesis on these two domains, as a small constant.
However, these approaches still face two issues: (1) Adversarial domain
alignment distorts the original feature distributions, deteriorating the
adaptability; (2) Transforming feature representations to be domain-invariant
needs to sacrifice domain-specific variations, resulting in weaker
discriminability. In order to alleviate these issues, we propose
category-invariant feature enhancement (CIFE), a general mechanism that
enhances the adversarial domain adaptation through optimizing the adaptability.
Specifically, the CIFE approach introduces category-invariant features to boost
the discriminability of domain-invariant features with preserving the
transferability. Experiments show that the CIFE could improve upon
representative adversarial domain adaptation methods to yield state-of-the-art
results on five benchmarks.]]></summary>

crucial importance to many computer vision and graphics tasks. Existing methods
typically remove specular highlight for medical images and specific-object
images, however, they cannot handle the images with text. In addition, the
impact of specular highlight on text recognition is rarely studied by text
detection and recognition community. Therefore, in this paper, we first raise
and study the text-aware single image specular highlight removal problem. The
core goal is to improve the accuracy of text detection and recognition by
removing the highlight from text images. To tackle this challenging problem, we
first collect three high-quality datasets with fine-grained annotations, which
will be appropriately released to facilitate the relevant research. Then, we
design a novel two-stage network, which contains a highlight detection network
and a highlight removal network. The output of highlight detection network
provides additional information about highlight regions to guide the subsequent
highlight removal network. Moreover, we suggest a measurement set including the
end-to-end text detection and recognition evaluation and auxiliary visual

existing methods require static datasets for training and are not capable of
learning from sequentially available new food images. Online continual learning
aims to learn new classes from data stream by using each new data only once
without forgetting the previously learned knowledge. However, none of the
existing works target food image analysis, which is more difficult to learn
incrementally due to its high intra-class variation with the unbalanced and
unpredictable characteristics of future food class distribution. In this paper,
we address these issues by introducing (1) a novel clustering based exemplar
selection algorithm to store the most representative data belonging to each
learned food for knowledge replay, and (2) an effective online learning regime
using balanced training batch along with the knowledge distillation on
augmented exemplars to maintain the model performance on all learned classes.
Our method is evaluated on a challenging large scale food image database,
Food-1K, by varying the number of newly added food classes. Our results show
significant improvements compared with existing state-of-the-art online
continual learning methods, showing great potential to achieve lifelong
learning for food image classification in real world.]]></summary>

making it liable to obvious artifacts when large occluded object regions are
inpainted. This paper presents occlusion-aware video object inpainting, which
recovers both the complete shape and appearance for occluded objects in videos
given their visible mask segmentation.

To facilitate this new research, we construct the first large-scale video
object inpainting benchmark YouTube-VOI to provide realistic occlusion
scenarios with both occluded and visible object masks available. Our technical
contribution VOIN jointly performs video object shape completion and occluded
texture generation. In particular, the shape completion module models
long-range object coherence while the flow completion module recovers accurate
flow with sharp motion boundary, for propagating temporally-consistent texture
to the same moving object across frames. For more realistic results, VOIN is
optimized using both T-PatchGAN and a new spatio-temporal attention-based
multi-class discriminator.

Finally, we compare VOIN and strong baselines on YouTube-VOI. Experimental
results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of our method including inpainting
complex and dynamic objects. VOIN degrades gracefully with inaccurate input
visible mask.]]></summary>

labels, while images are inherently multi-labeled in our daily life. Such an
annotation gap makes many pre-trained single-label classification models fail
in practical scenarios. This annotation issue is more concerned for aerial
images: Aerial data collected from sensors naturally cover a relatively large
land area with multiple labels, while annotated aerial datasets, which are
publicly available (e.g., UCM, AID), are single-labeled. As manually annotating
multi-label aerial images would be time/labor-consuming, we propose a novel
self-correction integrated domain adaptation (SCIDA) method for automatic
multi-label learning. SCIDA is weakly supervised, i.e., automatically learning
the multi-label image classification model from using massive, publicly
available single-label images. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel
Label-Wise self-Correction (LWC) module to better explore underlying label
correlations. This module also makes the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)
from single- to multi-label data possible. For model training, the proposed
model only uses single-label information yet requires no prior knowledge of
multi-labeled data; and it predicts labels for multi-label aerial images. In
our experiments, trained with single-labeled MAI-AID-s and MAI-UCM-s datasets,
the proposed model is tested directly on our collected Multi-scene Aerial Image

from the water. Spherical glass, a dome port, is well suited for high water
pressures at great depth, allows for a large field of view, and avoids
refraction if a pinhole camera is positioned exactly at the sphere's center.
Adjusting a real lens perfectly to the dome center is a challenging task, both
in terms of how to actually guide the centering process (e.g. visual servoing)
and how to measure the alignment quality, but also, how to mechanically perform
the alignment. Consequently, such systems are prone to being decentered by some
offset, leading to challenging refraction patterns at the sphere that
invalidate the pinhole camera model. We show that the overall camera system
becomes an axial camera, even for thick domes as used for deep sea exploration
and provide a non-iterative way to compute the center of refraction without
requiring knowledge of exact air, glass or water properties. We also analyze
the refractive geometry at the sphere, looking at effects such as forward- vs.
backward decentering, iso-refraction curves and obtain a 6th-degree polynomial
equation for forward projection of 3D points in thin domes. We then propose a
pure underwater calibration procedure to estimate the decentering from multiple
images. This estimate can either be used during adjustment to guide the
mechanical position of the lens, or can be considered in photogrammetric
underwater applications.]]></summary>

research interests because of its scalability and possibility for real-world
applications. State-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods usually follow a
clustering-based strategy, which generates pseudo labels by clustering and
maintains a memory to store instance features and represent the centroid of the
clusters for contrastive learning. This approach suffers two problems. First,
the centroid generated by unsupervised learning may not be a perfect prototype.
Forcing images to get closer to the centroid emphasizes the result of
clustering, which could accumulate clustering errors during iterations. Second,
previous methods utilize features obtained at different training iterations to
represent one centroid, which is not consistent with the current training
sample, since the features are not directly comparable. To this end, we propose
an unsupervised re-ID approach with a stochastic learning strategy.
Specifically, we adopt a stochastic updated memory, where a random instance
from a cluster is used to update the cluster-level memory for contrastive
learning. In this way, the relationship between randomly selected pair of
images are learned to avoid the training bias caused by unreliable pseudo
labels. The stochastic memory is also always up-to-date for classifying to keep
the consistency. Besides, to relieve the issue of camera variance, a unified
distance matrix is proposed during clustering, where the distance bias from
different camera domain is reduced and the variances of identities is
emphasized.]]></summary>

diabetic patients. However, vision loss occurs primarily in the late stages of
DR, and the symptoms of visual impairment, ranging from mild to severe, can
vary greatly, adding to the burden of diagnosis and treatment in clinical
practice. Deep learning methods based on retinal images have achieved
remarkable success in automatic DR grading, but most of them neglect that the
presence of diabetes usually affects both eyes, and ophthalmologists usually
compare both eyes concurrently for DR diagnosis, leaving correlations between
left and right eyes unexploited. In this study, simulating the diagnostic
process, we propose a two-stream binocular network to capture the subtle
correlations between left and right eyes, in which, paired images of eyes are
fed into two identical subnetworks separately during training. We design a
contrastive grading loss to learn binocular correlation for five-class DR
detection, which maximizes inter-class dissimilarity while minimizing the
intra-class difference. Experimental results on the EyePACS dataset show the
superiority of the proposed binocular model, outperforming monocular methods by

broadcast, providing richer experiences and valuable insights to fans. The
first step of augmented reality systems is camera calibration, possibly based
on detecting the line markings of the field of play. Most existing proposals
for line detection rely on edge detection and Hough transform, but optical
distortion and extraneous edges cause inaccurate or spurious detections of line
markings. We propose a novel strategy to automatically and accurately segment
line markings based on a stochastic watershed transform that is robust to
optical distortions, since it makes no assumptions about line straightness, and
is unaffected by the presence of players or the ball in the field of play.
Firstly, the playing field as a whole is segmented completely eliminating the
stands and perimeter boards. Then the line markings are extracted.

The strategy has been tested on a new and public database composed by 60
annotated images from matches in five stadiums. The results obtained have
proven that the proposed segmentation algorithm allows successful and precise
detection of most line mark pixels.]]></summary>

emerging demand of specific action understanding in real-world applications,
whereas the data of rare fine-grained categories is very limited. Therefore, we
propose the few-shot fine-grained action recognition problem, aiming to
recognize novel fine-grained actions with only few samples given for each
class. Although progress has been made in coarse-grained actions, existing
few-shot recognition methods encounter two issues handling fine-grained
actions: the inability to capture subtle action details and the inadequacy in
learning from data with low inter-class variance. To tackle the first issue, a
human vision inspired bidirectional attention module (BAM) is proposed.
Combining top-down task-driven signals with bottom-up salient stimuli, BAM
captures subtle action details by accurately highlighting informative
spatio-temporal regions. To address the second issue, we introduce contrastive
meta-learning (CML). Compared with the widely adopted ProtoNet-based method,
CML generates more discriminative video representations for low inter-class
variance data, since it makes full use of potential contrastive pairs in each
training episode. Furthermore, to fairly compare different models, we establish
specific benchmark protocols on two large-scale fine-grained action recognition
datasets. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across evaluated tasks.]]></summary>

at different geographic locations and under various weather conditions. While
recent 3D detection research focuses on improving performance within a single
domain, our study reveals that the performance of modern detectors can drop
drastically cross-domain. In this paper, we investigate unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. On the Waymo Domain
Adaptation dataset, we identify the deteriorating point cloud quality as the
root cause of the performance drop. To address this issue, we present Semantic
Point Generation (SPG), a general approach to enhance the reliability of LiDAR
detectors against domain shifts. Specifically, SPG generates semantic points at
the predicted foreground regions and faithfully recovers missing parts of the
foreground objects, which are caused by phenomena such as occlusions, low
reflectance or weather interference. By merging the semantic points with the
original points, we obtain an augmented point cloud, which can be directly
consumed by modern LiDAR-based detectors. To validate the wide applicability of
SPG, we experiment with two representative detectors, PointPillars and PV-RCNN.
On the UDA task, SPG significantly improves both detectors across all object
categories of interest and at all difficulty levels. SPG can also benefit
object detection in the original domain. On the Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI,
SPG improves 3D detection results of these two methods across all categories.
Combined with PV-RCNN, SPG achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection results on
KITTI.]]></summary>

Feature embedding aims to place features closer in the embedding space if they

Self-attention generates refined attention features by computing attention

our PTT-Net surpasses the state-of-the-art by a noticeable margin (~10\%).

images from single RGB images captured by commercial cameras, \textbf{without}
using paired HS and RGB images during training. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a new lightweight and end-to-end learning-based framework.
Specifically, on the basis of the intrinsic imaging degradation model of RGB
images from HS images, we progressively spread the differences between input
RGB images and re-projected RGB images from recovered HS images via effective
unsupervised camera spectral response function estimation. To enable the
learning without paired ground-truth HS images as supervision, we adopt the
adversarial learning manner and boost it with a simple yet effective
$\mathcal{L}_1$ gradient clipping scheme. Besides, we embed the semantic
information of input RGB images to locally regularize the unsupervised
learning, which is expected to promote pixels with identical semantics to have
consistent spectral signatures. In addition to conducting quantitative
experiments over two widely-used datasets for HS image reconstruction from
synthetic RGB images, we also evaluate our method by applying recovered HS
images from real RGB images to HS-based visual tracking. Extensive results show
that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods

manufacturing industry to guarantee the product quality. Many deep learning
methods have been widely used in surface defect detection tasks, and have been
proven to perform well in defects classification and location. However, deep
learning-based detection methods often require plenty of data for training,
which fail to apply to the real industrial scenarios since the distribution of
defect categories is often imbalanced. In other words, common defect classes
have many samples but rare defect classes have extremely few samples, and it is
difficult for these methods to well detect rare defect classes. To solve the
imbalanced distribution problem, in this paper we propose TL-SDD: a novel
Transfer Learning-based method for Surface Defect Detection. First, we adopt a
two-phase training scheme to transfer the knowledge from common defect classes
to rare defect classes. Second, we propose a novel Metric-based Surface Defect
Detection (M-SDD) model. We design three modules for this model: (1) feature
extraction module: containing feature fusion which combines high-level semantic
information with low-level structural information. (2) feature reweighting
module: transforming examples to a reweighting vector that indicates the
importance of features. (3) distance metric module: learning a metric space in
which defects are classified by computing distances to representations of each
category. Finally, we validate the performance of our proposed method on a real
dataset including surface defects of aluminum profiles. Compared to the
baseline methods, the performance of our proposed method has improved by up to
11.98% for rare defect classes.]]></summary>

mainly employed deep neural networks to learn the normal patterns of temporal

utilize instance-level (or weak) anomaly labels, which only indicate whether
any anomalous events occurred or not in each instance of temporal data. In this
paper, we present WETAS, a novel framework that effectively identifies
anomalous temporal segments (i.e., consecutive time points) in an input
instance. WETAS learns discriminative features from the instance-level labels
so that it infers the sequential order of normal and anomalous segments within
each instance, which can be used as a rough segmentation mask. Based on the
dynamic time warping (DTW) alignment between the input instance and its
segmentation mask, WETAS obtains the result of temporal segmentation, and
simultaneously, it further enhances itself by using the mask as additional
supervision. Our experiments show that WETAS considerably outperforms other
baselines in terms of the localization of temporal anomalies, and also it
provides more informative results than point-level detection methods.]]></summary>

challenging task in real-world scenarios due to various factors, including
intra-class variance, class imbalance, and occlusion. Most of the previous
methods rarely solve the cases that the prohibited items are deliberately
hidden in messy objects due to the lack of large-scale datasets, restricted
their applications in real-world scenarios. Towards real-world prohibited item
detection, we collect a large-scale dataset, named as PIDray, which covers
various cases in real-world scenarios for prohibited item detection, especially
for deliberately hidden items. With an intensive amount of effort, our dataset
contains $12$ categories of prohibited items in $47,677$ X-ray images with
high-quality annotated segmentation masks and bounding boxes. To the best of
our knowledge, it is the largest prohibited items detection dataset to date.
Meanwhile, we design the selective dense attention network (SDANet) to
construct a strong baseline, which consists of the dense attention module and
the dependency refinement module. The dense attention module formed by the
spatial and channel-wise dense attentions, is designed to learn the
discriminative features to boost the performance. The dependency refinement

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3D object detection is an important task in computer vision. Most existing
methods require a large number of high-quality 3D annotations, which are
expensive to collect. Especially for outdoor scenes, the problem becomes more
severe due to the sparseness of the point cloud and the complexity of urban
scenes. Semi-supervised learning is a promising technique to mitigate the data
annotation issue. Inspired by this, we propose a novel semi-supervised
framework based on pseudo-labeling for outdoor 3D object detection tasks. We
design the Adaptive Class Confidence Selection module (ACCS) to generate
high-quality pseudo-labels. Besides, we propose Holistic Point Cloud
Augmentation (HPCA) for unlabeled data to improve robustness. Experiments on
the KITTI benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.]]></summary>

centuries, humans have dedicated themselves to producing arts to convey their
imagination. The advancement in technology and deep learning in particular, has
caught the attention of many researchers trying to investigate whether art
generation is possible by computers and algorithms. Using generative
adversarial networks (GANs), applications such as synthesizing photorealistic
human faces and creating captions automatically from images were realized. This
survey takes a comprehensive look at the recent works using GANs for generating
visual arts, music, and literary text. A performance comparison and description

outstanding results in many applications. Generative Adversarial Networks are
powerful yet, resource-hungry deep-learning models. Their main difference from
ordinary deep learning models is the nature of their output. For example, GAN
output can be a whole image versus other models detecting objects or
classifying images. Thus, the architecture and numeric precision of the network
affect the quality and speed of the solution. Hence, accelerating GANs is
pivotal. Accelerating GANs can be classified into three main tracks: (1) Memory
compression, (2) Computation optimization, and (3) Data-flow optimization.
Because data transfer is the main source of energy usage, memory compression
leads to the most savings. Thus, in this paper, we survey memory compression
techniques for CNN-Based GANs. Additionally, the paper summarizes opportunities
and challenges in GANs acceleration and suggests open research problems to be
further investigated.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves a supervised loss in a labeled
source domain and an unsupervised loss in an unlabeled target domain, which
often faces more severe overfitting (than classical supervised learning) as the
supervised source loss has clear domain gap and the unsupervised target loss is
often noisy due to the lack of annotations. This paper presents RDA, a robust
domain adaptation technique that introduces adversarial attacking to mitigate
overfitting in UDA. We achieve robust domain adaptation by a novel Fourier
adversarial attacking (FAA) method that allows large magnitude of perturbation
noises but has minimal modification of image semantics, the former is critical
to the effectiveness of its generated adversarial samples due to the existence
of 'domain gaps'. Specifically, FAA decomposes images into multiple frequency
components (FCs) and generates adversarial samples by just perturbating certain
FCs that capture little semantic information. With FAA-generated samples, the
training can continue the 'random walk' and drift into an area with a flat loss
landscape, leading to more robust domain adaptation. Extensive experiments over
multiple domain adaptation tasks show that RDA can work with different computer
vision tasks with superior performance.]]></summary>

and PDE discoveries in computational physics. One caveat of current methods
however is the need for large amounts of (clean) data in order to recover full
system responses or underlying physical models. Bayesian methods may be
particularly promising to overcome these challenges as they are naturally less
sensitive to sparse and noisy data. In this paper, we propose to use Bayesian
neural networks (BNN) in order to: 1) Recover the full system states from
measurement data (e.g. temperature, velocity field, etc.). We use Hamiltonian
Monte-Carlo to sample the posterior distribution of a deep and dense BNN, and
show that it is possible to accurately capture physics of varying complexity
without overfitting. 2) Recover the parameters in the underlying partial
differential equation (PDE) governing the physical system. Using the trained
BNN as a surrogate of the system response, we generate datasets of derivatives
potentially comprising the latent PDE of the observed system and perform a
Bayesian linear regression (BLR) between the successive derivatives in space
and time to recover the original PDE parameters. We take advantage of the
confidence intervals on the BNN outputs and introduce the spatial derivative
variance into the BLR likelihood to discard the influence of highly uncertain
surrogate data points, which allows for more accurate parameter discovery. We
demonstrate our approach on a handful of example applied to physics and
non-linear dynamics.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To build a robust and practical content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system
that is applicable to a clinical brain MRI database, we propose a new framework
-- Disease-oriented image embedding with pseudo-scanner standardization
(DI-PSS) -- that consists of two core techniques, data harmonization and a
dimension reduction algorithm. Our DI-PSS uses skull stripping and
CycleGAN-based image transformations that map to a standard brain followed by
transformation into a brain image taken with a given reference scanner. Then,
our 3D convolutioinal autoencoders (3D-CAE) with deep metric learning acquires
a low-dimensional embedding that better reflects the characteristics of the
disease. The effectiveness of our proposed framework was tested on the
T1-weighted MRIs selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
and the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. We confirmed that our PSS
greatly reduced the variability of low-dimensional embeddings caused by
different scanner and datasets. Compared with the baseline condition, our PSS
reduced the variability in the distance from Alzheimer's disease (AD) to
clinically normal (CN) and Parkinson disease (PD) cases by 15.8-22.6% and
18.0-29.9%, respectively. These properties allow DI-PSS to generate lower
dimensional representations that are more amenable to disease classification.
In AD and CN classification experiments based on spectral clustering, PSS
improved the average accuracy and macro-F1 by 6.2% and 10.7%, respectively.
Given the potential of the DI-PSS for harmonizing images scanned by MRI
scanners that were not used to scan the training data, we expect that the
DI-PSS is suitable for application to a large number of legacy MRIs scanned in
heterogeneous environments.]]></summary>

components for training self-supervised ViT. We observe that instability is a
major issue that degrades accuracy, and it can be hidden by apparently good
results. We reveal that these results are indeed partial failure, and they can

only using \textbf{unpaired} labeled images and generalize to real-world
bitemporal images. To evaluate the effectiveness of STAR, we design a simple
yet effective change detector called ChangeStar, which can reuse any deep
semantic segmentation architecture by the ChangeMixin module. The comprehensive
experimental results show that ChangeStar outperforms the baseline with a large
margin under single-temporal supervision and achieves superior performance

While many tools have been developed to simulate neuronal dynamics or convert
deep networks to spiking models, general software libraries for learning rules
remain underexplored. This is partly due to the diverse, challenging nature of
efforts to design new learning rules, which range from encoding methods to
gradient approximations, from population approaches that mimic the Bayesian
brain to constrained learning algorithms deployed on memristor crossbars. To
address this gap, we present Neko, a modular, extensible library with a focus
on aiding the design of new learning algorithms. We demonstrate the utility of
Neko in three exemplar cases: online local learning, probabilistic learning,
and analog on-device learning. Our results show that Neko can replicate the
state-of-the-art algorithms and, in one case, lead to significant
outperformance in accuracy and speed. Further, it offers tools including
gradient comparison that can help develop new algorithmic variants. Neko is an

leap-forwards in dense image prediction. However, the issue of feature
alignment remains as neglected by most existing approaches for simplicity.
Direct pixel addition between upsampled and local features leads to feature
maps with misaligned contexts that, in turn, translate to mis-classifications
in prediction, especially on object boundaries. In this paper, we propose a
feature alignment module that learns transformation offsets of pixels to
contextually align upsampled higher-level features; and another feature
selection module to emphasize the lower-level features with rich spatial
details. We then integrate these two modules in a top-down pyramidal
architecture and present the Feature-aligned Pyramid Network (FaPN). Extensive
experimental evaluations on four dense prediction tasks and four datasets have
demonstrated the efficacy of FaPN, yielding an overall improvement of 1.2 - 2.6
points in AP / mIoU over FPN when paired with Faster / Mask R-CNN. In
particular, our FaPN achieves the state-of-the-art of 56.7% mIoU on ADE20K when

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sleep staging plays an important role on the diagnosis of sleep disorders. In
general, experts classify sleep stages manually based on polysomnography (PSG),
which is quite time-consuming. Meanwhile, the acquisition process of multiple
signals is much complex, which can affect the subject's sleep. Therefore, the
use of single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) for automatic sleep staging
has become a popular research topic. In the literature, a large number of sleep
staging methods based on single-channel EEG have been proposed with promising
results and achieve the preliminary automation of sleep staging. However, the
performance for most of these methods in the N1 stage do not satisfy the needs
of the diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model multi scale
dual attention network(MSDAN) based on raw EEG, which utilizes multi-scale
convolution to extract features in different waveforms contained in the EEG
signal, connects channel attention and spatial attention mechanisms in series
to filter and highlight key information, and uses soft thresholding to remove
redundant information. Experiments were conducted using two datasets with
5-fold cross-validation and hold-out validation method. The final average
accuracy, overall accuracy, macro F1 score and Cohen's Kappa coefficient of the
model reach 96.70%, 91.74%, 0.8231 and 0.8723 on the Sleep-EDF dataset, 96.14%,
90.35%, 0.7945 and 0.8284 on the Sleep-EDFx dataset. Significantly, our model
performed superiorly in the N1 stage, with F1 scores of 54.41% and 52.79% on
the two datasets respectively. The results show the superiority of our network
over the existing methods, reaching a new state-of-the-art. In particular, the
proposed method achieves excellent results in the N1 sleep stage compared to
other methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While deep reinforcement learning has achieved promising results in
challenging decision-making tasks, the main bones of its success --- deep
neural networks are mostly black-boxes. A feasible way to gain insight into a
black-box model is to distill it into an interpretable model such as a decision
tree, which consists of if-then rules and is easy to grasp and be verified.
However, the traditional model distillation is usually a supervised learning
task under a stationary data distribution assumption, which is violated in
reinforcement learning. Therefore, a typical policy distillation that clones
model behaviors with even a small error could bring a data distribution shift,
resulting in an unsatisfied distilled policy model with low fidelity or low
performance. In this paper, we propose to address this issue by changing the
distillation objective from behavior cloning to maximizing an advantage
evaluation. The novel distillation objective maximizes an approximated
cumulative reward and focuses more on disastrous behaviors in critical states,
which controls the data shift effect. We evaluate our method on several Gym
tasks, a commercial fight game, and a self-driving car simulator. The empirical
results show that the proposed method can preserve a higher cumulative reward
than behavior cloning and learn a more consistent policy to the original one.
Moreover, by examining the extracted rules from the distilled decision trees,
we demonstrate that the proposed method delivers reasonable and robust
decisions.]]></summary>

forecasting approach N-BEATS for continuous time series on top levels and a
widely used tree-based algorithm LightGBM for the bottom level intermittent
time series. The hierarchical forecasting with alignment approach is a simple
yet effective variant of the bottom-up method, which accounts for biases that
are difficult to observe at the bottom level. It allows suboptimal forecasts at
the lower level to retain a higher overall performance. The approach in this
empirical study was developed by the first author during the M5 Forecasting

Specifically, we consider $Y = A X\in \mathbb{R}^{p\times n}$ where the matrix

the matrix $X\in \mathbb{R}^{r\times n}$ is element-wise sparse. We prove that
this sparse decomposition of $Y$ can be uniquely identified, up to some
intrinsic signed permutation. Our approach relies on solving a nonconvex
optimization problem constrained over the unit sphere. Our geometric analysis
for the nonconvex optimization landscape shows that any {\em strict} local
solution is close to the ground truth solution, and can be recovered by a
simple data-driven initialization followed with any second order descent
algorithm. At last, we corroborate these theoretical results with numerical

designing efficient and optimal vector quantizers that respect this bit budget.
The resulting polynomial complexity source coding schemes are used to design
distributed optimization algorithms with convergence rates matching the minimax
optimal lower bounds for (i) Smooth and Strongly-Convex objectives with access
to an Exact Gradient oracle, as well as (ii) General Convex and Non-Smooth
objectives with access to a Noisy Subgradient oracle. We further propose a
relaxation of this coding scheme which is nearly minimax optimal. Numerical
simulations validate our theoretical claims.]]></summary>

mathematical consequence of applying quiver representation theory to neural
networks. Neural teleportation "teleports" a network to a new position in the
weight space and preserves its function. This phenomenon comes directly from
the definitions of representation theory applied to neural networks and it
turns out to be a very simple operation that has remarkable properties. We shed
light on surprising and counter-intuitive consequences neural teleportation has
on the loss landscape. In particular, we show that teleportation can be used to
explore loss level curves, that it changes the local loss landscape, sharpens
global minima and boosts back-propagated gradients at any moment during the
learning process. Our results can be reproduced with the code available here:

of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for brain tumor segmentation with a low
computation requirement. The system consists of a CNN for the main processing
for the segmentation, a pre-CNN block for data reduction and post-CNN
refinement block. The unique CNN consists of 7 convolution layers involving
only 108 kernels and 20308 trainable parameters. It is custom-designed,
following the proposed paradigm of ASCNN (application specific CNN), to perform
mono-modality and cross-modality feature extraction, tumor localization and
pixel classification. Each layer fits the task assigned to it, by means of (i)
appropriate normalization applied to its input data, (ii) correct convolution
modes for the assigned task, and (iii) suitable nonlinear transformation to
optimize the convolution results. In this specific design context, the number
of kernels in each of the 7 layers is made to be just-sufficient for its task,
instead of exponentially growing over the layers, to increase information
density and to reduce randomness in the processing. The proposed activation
function Full-ReLU helps to halve the number of kernels in convolution layers
of high-pass filtering without degrading processing quality. A large number of
experiments with BRATS2018 dataset have been conducted to measure the
processing quality and reproducibility of the proposed system. The results
demonstrate that the system reproduces reliably almost the same output to the
same input after retraining. The mean dice scores for enhancing tumor, whole
tumor and tumor core are 77.2%, 89.2% and 76.3%, respectively. The simple
structure and reliable high processing quality of the proposed system will
facilitate its implementation and medical applications.]]></summary>

mode of transportation wherein travel requests are dynamically handled by a
coordinated fleet of robotic, self-driving vehicles. Given a graph
representation of the transportation network - one where, for example, nodes
represent areas of the city, and edges the connectivity between them - we argue
that the AMoD control problem is naturally cast as a node-wise decision-making
problem. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework to
control the rebalancing of AMoD systems through graph neural networks.
Crucially, we demonstrate that graph neural networks enable reinforcement
learning agents to recover behavior policies that are significantly more
transferable, generalizable, and scalable than policies learned through other
approaches. Empirically, we show how the learned policies exhibit promising
zero-shot transfer capabilities when faced with critical portability tasks such
as inter-city generalization, service area expansion, and adaptation to

explicitly predict grasping configurations, such as gripper approaching angles
or grasping preshapes. Classic motion planners could then sample trajectories
by using such predicted configurations. In this work, our goal is instead to
fill the gap between affordance discovery and affordance-based policy learning
by integrating the two objectives in an end-to-end imitation learning framework
based on deep neural networks. From a psychological perspective, there is a
close association between attention and affordance. Therefore, with an
end-to-end neural network, we propose to learn affordance cues as visual
attention that serves as a useful indicating signal of how a demonstrator
accomplishes tasks, instead of explicitly modeling affordances. To achieve
this, we propose a contrastive learning framework that consists of a Siamese
encoder and a trajectory decoder. We further introduce a coupled triplet loss
to encourage the discovered affordance cues to be more affordance-relevant. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our model with the coupled triplet loss
achieves the highest grasping success rate in a simulated robot environment.

subject to a user-defined level of fairness. We enforce fairness as a model
selection step in which we choose the value of a ridge penalty to control the
effect of sensitive attributes. We then estimate the parameters of the model
conditional on the chosen penalty value. Our proposal is mathematically simple,
with a solution that is partly in closed form, and produces estimates of the
regression coefficients that are intuitive to interpret as a function of the
level of fairness. Furthermore, it is easily extended to generalised linear
models, kernelised regression models and other penalties; and it can
accommodate multiple definitions of fairness.

We compare our approach with the regression model from Komiyama et al.
(2018), which implements a provably-optimal linear regression model; and with
the fair models from Zafar et al. (2019). We evaluate these approaches
empirically on six different data sets, and we find that our proposal provides
better goodness of fit and better predictive accuracy for the same level of
fairness. In addition, we highlight a source of bias in the original
experimental evaluation in Komiyama et al. (2018).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper tackles the task of category-level pose estimation for garments.
With a near infinite degree of freedom, a garment's full configuration (i.e.,
poses) is often described by the per-vertex 3D locations of its entire 3D
surface. However, garments are also commonly subject to extreme cases of
self-occlusion, especially when folded or crumpled, making it challenging to
perceive their full 3D surface. To address these challenges, we propose
GarmentNets, where the key idea is to formulate the deformable object pose
estimation problem as a shape completion task in the canonical space. This
canonical space is defined across garments instances within a category,
therefore, specifies the shared category-level pose. By mapping the observed
partial surface to the canonical space and completing it in this space, the
output representation describes the garment's full configuration using a
complete 3D mesh with the per-vertex canonical coordinate label. To properly
handle the thin 3D structure presented on garments, we proposed a novel 3D
shape representation using the generalized winding number field. Experiments
demonstrate that GarmentNets is able to generalize to unseen garment instances
and achieve significantly better performance compared to alternative
approaches.]]></summary>

characterize the distribution of pixel values in different image regions. We
describe a new approach for estimating appearance models directly from an
image, without explicit consideration of the pixels that make up each region.
Our approach is based on novel algebraic expressions that relate local image
statistics to the appearance of spatially coherent regions. We describe two
algorithms that can use the aforementioned algebraic expressions to estimate
appearance models directly from an image. The first algorithm solves a system
of linear and quadratic equations using a least squares formulation. The second
algorithm is a spectral method based on an eigenvector computation. We present
experimental results that demonstrate the proposed methods work well in

model can easily become overfitted based on the biased distribution formed by
only a few training examples. In this paper, we calibrate the distribution of
these few-sample classes by transferring statistics from the classes with
sufficient examples, then an adequate number of examples can be sampled from
the calibrated distribution to expand the inputs to the classifier. We assume
every dimension in the feature representation follows a Gaussian distribution
so that the mean and the variance of the distribution can borrow from that of
similar classes whose statistics are better estimated with an adequate number
of samples. Our method can be built on top of off-the-shelf pretrained feature
extractors and classification models without extra parameters. We show that a
simple logistic regression classifier trained using the features sampled from
our calibrated distribution can outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy on two

creativity. This paper introduces from first principles an abstract algebraic
framework of analogical proportions of the form `$a$ is to $b$ what $c$ is to
$d$' in the general setting of universal algebra. This enables us to compare
mathematical objects possibly across different domains in a uniform way which
is crucial for AI-systems. The main idea is to define solutions to analogical
equations in terms of maximal sets of algebraic justifications, which amounts
to deriving abstract terms of concrete elements from a `known' source domain
which can then be instantiated in an `unknown' target domain to obtain
analogous elements. It turns out that our notion of analogical proportions has
appealing mathematical properties. We compare our framework with two recently
introduced frameworks of analogical proportions from the literature in the
concrete domains of sets and numbers, and we show that in each case we either
disagree with the notion from the literature justified by some counter-example
or we can show that our model yields strictly more solutions. As we construct
our model from first principles using only elementary concepts of universal
algebra, and since our model questions some basic properties of analogical
proportions presupposed in the literature, to convince the reader of the
plausibility of our model we show that it can be naturally embedded into
first-order logic via model-theoretic types, and prove that analogical
proportions are compatible with structure-preserving mappings from that
perspective. This provides strong evidence for its applicability. In a broader
sense, this paper is a first step towards a theory of analogical reasoning and
learning systems with potential applications to fundamental AI-problems like
commonsense reasoning and computational learning and creativity.]]></summary>

dataset for action recognition on 500 classes with over 591K labeled frames. To
minimize ambiguities in action classification, HAA500 consists of highly
diversified classes of fine-grained atomic actions, where only consistent
actions fall under the same label, e.g., "Baseball Pitching" vs "Free Throw in
Basketball". Thus HAA500 is different from existing atomic action datasets,
where coarse-grained atomic actions were labeled with coarse action-verbs such
as "Throw". HAA500 has been carefully curated to capture the precise movement
of human figures with little class-irrelevant motions or spatio-temporal label
noises. The advantages of HAA500 are fourfold: 1) human-centric actions with a
high average of 69.7% detectable joints for the relevant human poses; 2) high
scalability since adding a new class can be done under 20-60 minutes; 3)
curated videos capturing essential elements of an atomic action without
irrelevant frames; 4) fine-grained atomic action classes. Our extensive
experiments including cross-data validation using datasets collected in the
wild demonstrate the clear benefits of human-centric and atomic characteristics
of HAA500, which enable training even a baseline deep learning model to improve
prediction by attending to atomic human poses. We detail the HAA500 dataset
statistics and collection methodology and compare quantitatively with existing
action recognition datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) aims to classify samples under the
assumption that some classes are not observable during training. To bridge the
gap between the seen and unseen classes, most GZSL methods attempt to associate
the visual features of seen classes with attributes or to generate unseen
samples directly. Nevertheless, the visual features used in the prior
approaches do not necessarily encode semantically related information that the
shared attributes refer to, which degrades the model generalization to unseen
classes. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel semantics
disentangling framework for the generalized zero-shot learning task (SDGZSL),
where the visual features of unseen classes are firstly estimated by a
conditional VAE and then factorized into semantic-consistent and
semantic-unrelated latent vectors. In particular, a total correlation penalty
is applied to guarantee the independence between the two factorized
representations, and the semantic consistency of which is measured by the
derived relation network. Extensive experiments conducted on four GZSL
benchmark datasets have evidenced that the semantic-consistent features
disentangled by the proposed SDGZSL are more generalizable in tasks of
canonical and generalized zero-shot learning. Our source code is available at

of the present results are either perceptually unsatisfactory or ineffective

masks which can be overlaid on facial images, such that the original identities
can be concealed without sacrificing the visual quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that TIP-IM provides 95\%+ protection success rate against various

deep neural networks are vulnerable to maliciously perturbed input data that
much degrade their performance. This is known as adversarial attacks. To
counter adversarial attacks, adversarial training formulated as a form of
robust optimization has been demonstrated to be effective. However, conducting
adversarial training brings much computational overhead compared with standard
training. In order to reduce the computational cost, we propose an annealing
mechanism, Amata, to reduce the overhead associated with adversarial training.
The proposed Amata is provably convergent, well-motivated from the lens of
optimal control theory and can be combined with existing acceleration methods
to further enhance performance. It is demonstrated that on standard datasets,
Amata can achieve similar or better robustness with around 1/3 to 1/2 the
computational time compared with traditional methods. In addition, Amata can be
incorporated into other adversarial training acceleration algorithms (e.g.
YOPO, Free, Fast, and ATTA), which leads to further reduction in computational

low cost and time efficiency. Although deep learning played a major role in the
recent success of acne detection, there are still several challenges such as

Feature Refinement integrates semantic information and fine details to enrich

fields of multi-scale features for context enhancement to handle scale
variation. Finally, Mask-Aware Multi-Attention detects densely arranged and
small acne by suppressing uninformative regions and highlighting probable acne
regions. Experiments are performed on acne image dataset ACNE04 and natural

named Intra- and Inter-Instance Collaborative Learning (I3CL). Specifically, to
address the first issue, we design an effective convolutional module with
multiple receptive fields, which is able to collaboratively learn better
character and gap feature representations at local and long ranges inside a
text instance. To address the second issue, we devise an instance-based
transformer module to exploit the dependencies between different text instances
and a global context module to exploit the semantic context from the shared
background, which are able to collaboratively learn more discriminative text
feature representation. In this way, I3CL can effectively exploit the intra-

framework. Besides, to make full use of the unlabeled data, we design an
effective semi-supervised learning method to leverage the pseudo labels via an

embeddings based on time-ordered item purchasing sequences, which is defined as
Sequential Recommendation (SR) problem. Existing methods leverage sequential
patterns to model item transitions. However, most of them ignore crucial
temporal collaborative signals, which are latent in evolving user-item
interactions and coexist with sequential patterns. Therefore, we propose to
unify sequential patterns and temporal collaborative signals to improve the
quality of recommendation, which is rather challenging. Firstly, it is hard to
simultaneously encode sequential patterns and collaborative signals. Secondly,
it is non-trivial to express the temporal effects of collaborative signals.

Hence, we design a new framework Temporal Graph Sequential Recommender

Temporal Collaborative Trans-former (TCT) layer in TGSRec, which advances the
self-attention mechanism by adopting a novel collaborative attention. TCT layer
can simultaneously capture collaborative signals from both users and items, as
well as considering temporal dynamics inside sequential patterns. We propagate
the information learned fromTCTlayerover the temporal graph to unify sequential

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adversarial training is a powerful type of defense against adversarial
examples. Previous empirical results suggest that adversarial training requires
wider networks for better performances. However, it remains elusive how neural
network width affects model robustness. In this paper, we carefully examine the
relationship between network width and model robustness. Specifically, we show
that the model robustness is closely related to the tradeoff between natural
accuracy and perturbation stability, which is controlled by the robust
regularization parameter $\lambda$. With the same $\lambda$, wider networks can
achieve better natural accuracy but worse perturbation stability, leading to a
potentially worse overall model robustness. To understand the origin of this
phenomenon, we further relate the perturbation stability with the network's
local Lipschitzness. By leveraging recent results on neural tangent kernels, we
theoretically show that wider networks tend to have worse perturbation
stability. Our analyses suggest that: 1) the common strategy of first
fine-tuning $\lambda$ on small networks and then directly use it for wide model
training could lead to deteriorated model robustness; 2) one needs to properly
enlarge $\lambda$ to unleash the robustness potential of wider models fully.
Finally, we propose a new Width Adjusted Regularization (WAR) method that
adaptively enlarges $\lambda$ on wide models and significantly saves the tuning
time.]]></summary>

performance, their deployment in critical applications such as law enforcement
and access control has seen an upswing, where any failure may have far-reaching
consequences. We need methods to build trust in deployed systems by making
their working as transparent as possible. Existing visualization algorithms are
designed for object recognition and do not give insightful results when applied
to the face domain. In this work, we present 'Canonical Saliency Maps', a new
method that highlights relevant facial areas by projecting saliency maps onto a
canonical face model. We present two kinds of Canonical Saliency Maps:
image-level maps and model-level maps. Image-level maps highlight facial
features responsible for the decision made by a deep face model on a given
image, thus helping to understand how a DNN made a prediction on the image.
Model-level maps provide an understanding of what the entire DNN model focuses
on in each task and thus can be used to detect biases in the model. Our
qualitative and quantitative results show the usefulness of the proposed
canonical saliency maps, which can be used on any deep face model regardless of
the architecture.]]></summary>

video capture is challenging due to the low frame rate of cameras working at
the high resolution mode. Digging deeper, the main bottleneck lies in the low
throughput of existing imaging systems. Towards this end, snapshot compressive
imaging (SCI) was proposed as a promising solution to improve the throughput of
imaging systems by compressive sampling and computational reconstruction.
During acquisition, multiple high-speed images are encoded and collapsed to a
single measurement. After this, algorithms are employed to retrieve the video
frames from the coded snapshot. Recently developed Plug-and-Play (PnP)
algorithms make it possible for SCI reconstruction in large-scale problems.
However, the lack of high-resolution encoding systems still precludes SCI's
wide application. In this paper, we build a novel hybrid coded aperture
snapshot compressive imaging (HCA-SCI) system by incorporating a dynamic liquid
crystal on silicon and a high-resolution lithography mask. We further implement
a PnP reconstruction algorithm with cascaded denoisers for high quality
reconstruction. Based on the proposed HCA-SCI system and algorithm, we achieve
a 10-mega pixel SCI system to capture high-speed scenes, leading to a high
throughput of 4.6G voxels per second. Both simulation and real data experiments
verify the feasibility and performance of our proposed HCA-SCI scheme.]]></summary>

two ways. We propose a novel two-step dense attention mechanism to discover
attribute-guided local visual features. We introduce new mutual learning
between the sub-networks to exploit mutually beneficial information for

key issues when exchanging information between the encoder and decoder: 1)
taking into account the differences in contribution between different-level
features; and 2) designing effective mechanism for fusing these features.
Different from existing CNN-based methods, we adopt a transformer encoder,
which learns more powerful and robust representations. In addition, considering
the image acquisition influence and elusive properties of polyps, we introduce
three novel modules, including a cascaded fusion module (CFM), a camouflage
identification module (CIM), a and similarity aggregation module (SAM). Among
these, the CFM is used to collect the semantic and location information of
polyps from high-level features, while the CIM is applied to capture polyp
information disguised in low-level features. With the help of the SAM, we
extend the pixel features of the polyp area with high-level semantic position
information to the entire polyp area, thereby effectively fusing cross-level
features. The proposed model, named \ourmodel, effectively suppresses noises in
the features and significantly improves their expressive capabilities.
Extensive experiments on five widely adopted datasets show that the proposed
model is more robust to various challenging situations (e.g., appearance
changes, small objects) than existing methods, and achieves the new
state-of-the-art performance. The proposed model is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We address the problem of network quantization, that is, reducing bit-widths
of weights and/or activations to lighten network architectures. Quantization
methods use a rounding function to map full-precision values to the nearest
quantized ones, but this operation is not differentiable. There are mainly two
approaches to training quantized networks with gradient-based optimizers.
First, a straight-through estimator (STE) replaces the zero derivative of the
rounding with that of an identity function, which causes a gradient mismatch
problem. Second, soft quantizers approximate the rounding with continuous
functions at training time, and exploit the rounding for quantization at test
time. This alleviates the gradient mismatch, but causes a quantizer gap
problem. We alleviate both problems in a unified framework. To this end, we
introduce a novel quantizer, dubbed a distance-aware quantizer (DAQ), that
mainly consists of a distance-aware soft rounding (DASR) and a temperature
controller. To alleviate the gradient mismatch problem, DASR approximates the
discrete rounding with the kernel soft argmax, which is based on our insight
that the quantization can be formulated as a distance-based assignment problem
between full-precision values and quantized ones. The controller adjusts the
temperature parameter in DASR adaptively according to the input, addressing the
quantizer gap problem. Experimental results on standard benchmarks show that
DAQ outperforms the state of the art significantly for various bit-widths
without bells and whistles.]]></summary>

and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved unprecedented success in
the task. Data augmentation is a widely used strategy that improves the
training of CNNs, and the design of the augmentation method for brain lesion
segmentation is still an open problem. In this work, we propose a simple data
augmentation approach, dubbed as CarveMix, for CNN-based brain lesion
segmentation. Like other "mix"-based methods, such as Mixup and CutMix,
CarveMix stochastically combines two existing labeled images to generate new
labeled samples. Yet, unlike these augmentation strategies based on image
combination, CarveMix is lesion-aware, where the combination is performed with
an attention on the lesions and a proper annotation is created for the
generated image. Specifically, from one labeled image we carve a region of
interest (ROI) according to the lesion location and geometry, and the size of
the ROI is sampled from a probability distribution. The carved ROI then
replaces the corresponding voxels in a second labeled image, and the annotation
of the second image is replaced accordingly as well. In this way, we generate
new labeled images for network training and the lesion information is
preserved. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments were performed on two
brain lesion datasets. The results show that our method improves the
segmentation accuracy compared with other simple data augmentation approaches.]]></summary>

detection (DAOD), recent advances mainly explore aligning feature-level
distributions between the source and single-target domain, which may neglect
the impact of domain-specific information existing in the aligned features.
Towards DAOD, it is important to extract domain-invariant object
representations. To this end, in this paper, we try to disentangle
domain-invariant representations from domain-specific representations. And we
propose a novel disentangled method based on vector decomposition. Firstly, an
extractor is devised to separate domain-invariant representations from the
input, which are used for extracting object proposals. Secondly,
domain-specific representations are introduced as the differences between the
input and domain-invariant representations. Through the difference operation,
the gap between the domain-specific and domain-invariant representations is
enlarged, which promotes domain-invariant representations to contain more
domain-irrelevant information. In the experiment, we separately evaluate our
method on the single- and compound-target case. For the single-target case,
experimental results of four domain-shift scenes show our method obtains a
significant performance gain over baseline methods. Moreover, for the
compound-target case (i.e., the target is a compound of two different domains
without domain labels), our method outperforms baseline methods by around 4%,
which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.]]></summary>

objects as events, which motivates our work in estimating 3D human pose and
shape from the event signals. Events, on the other hand, have their unique
challenges: rather than capturing static body postures, the event signals are
best at capturing local motions. This leads us to propose a two-stage deep
learning approach, called EventHPE. The first-stage, FlowNet, is trained by
unsupervised learning to infer optical flow from events. Both events and
optical flow are closely related to human body dynamics, which are fed as input
to the ShapeNet in the second stage, to estimate 3D human shapes. To mitigate
the discrepancy between image-based flow (optical flow) and shape-based flow
(vertices movement of human body shape), a novel flow coherence loss is
introduced by exploiting the fact that both flows are originated from the
identical human motion. An in-house event-based 3D human dataset is curated
that comes with 3D pose and shape annotations, which is by far the largest one

propose a novel Self-Supervised Harmonization framework (SSH) that can be
trained using just "free" natural images without being edited. We reformulate
the image harmonization problem from a representation fusion perspective, which
separately processes the foreground and background examples, to address the
background occlusion issue. This framework design allows for a dual data
augmentation method, where diverse [foreground, background, pseudo GT] triplets
can be generated by cropping an image with perturbations using 3D color lookup
tables (LUTs). In addition, we build a real-world harmonization dataset as
carefully created by expert users, for evaluation and benchmarking purposes.
Our results show that the proposed self-supervised method outperforms previous

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vision-and-language pretraining (VLP) aims to learn generic multimodal
representations from massive image-text pairs. While various successful
attempts have been proposed, learning fine-grained semantic alignments between
image-text pairs plays a key role in their approaches. Nevertheless, most
existing VLP approaches have not fully utilized the intrinsic knowledge within
the image-text pairs, which limits the effectiveness of the learned alignments
and further restricts the performance of their models. To this end, we
introduce a new VLP method called ROSITA, which integrates the cross- and
intra-modal knowledge in a unified scene graph to enhance the semantic
alignments. Specifically, we introduce a novel structural knowledge masking
(SKM) strategy to use the scene graph structure as a priori to perform masked
language (region) modeling, which enhances the semantic alignments by
eliminating the interference information within and across modalities.
Extensive ablation studies and comprehensive analysis verifies the
effectiveness of ROSITA in semantic alignments. Pretrained with both in-domain
and out-of-domain datasets, ROSITA significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art VLP methods on three typical vision-and-language tasks over
six benchmark datasets.]]></summary>

integrates Flow reconstruction and Frame prediction seamlessly to handle Video
Anomaly Detection. Firstly, we design the network of ML-MemAE-SC (Multi-Level
Memory modules in an Autoencoder with Skip Connections) to memorize normal
patterns for optical flow reconstruction so that abnormal events can be
sensitively identified with larger flow reconstruction errors. More
importantly, conditioned on the reconstructed flows, we then employ a
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which captures the high correlation
between video frame and optical flow, to predict the next frame given several
previous frames. By CVAE, the quality of flow reconstruction essentially
influences that of frame prediction. Therefore, poorly reconstructed optical
flows of abnormal events further deteriorate the quality of the final predicted
future frame, making the anomalies more detectable. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available at

high-dimensional assisted score-based generative model for color image
restoration tasks. Considering that the sample number and internal dimension in
score-based generative model have key influence on estimating the gradients of
data distribution, two different high-dimensional ways are proposed: The
channel-copy transformation increases the sample number and the pixel-scale
transformation decreases feasible space dimension. Subsequently, a set of
high-dimensional tensors represented by these transformations are used to train
the network through denoising score matching. Then, sampling is performed by
annealing Langevin dynamics and alternative data-consistency update.
Furthermore, to alleviate the difficulty of learning high-dimensional
representation, a progressive strategy is proposed to leverage the performance.
The proposed unsupervised learning and iterative restoration algo-rithm, which
involves a pre-trained generative network to obtain prior, has transparent and
clear interpretation compared to other data-driven approaches. Experimental
results on demosaicking and inpainting conveyed the remarkable performance and

hazard warnings (e.g., for flash floods or landslides). Current remotely sensed
precipitation products have a few hours of latency, associated with the
acquisition and processing of satellite data. By applying a robust nowcasting
system to these products, it is (in principle) possible to reduce this latency
and improve their applicability, value, and impact. However, the development of
such a system is complicated by the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, and the
consequent rapid changes that can occur in the structures of precipitation
systems In this work, we develop two approaches (hereafter referred to as
Nowcasting-Nets) that use Recurrent and Convolutional deep neural network
structures to address the challenge of precipitation nowcasting. A total of
five models are trained using Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Integrated
Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) precipitation data over the Eastern
Contiguous United States (CONUS) and then tested against independent data for
the Eastern and Western CONUS. The models were designed to provide forecasts
with a lead time of up to 1.5 hours and, by using a feedback loop approach, the
ability of the models to extend the forecast time to 4.5 hours was also
investigated. Model performance was compared against the Random Forest (RF) and
Linear Regression (LR) machine learning methods, and also against a persistence
benchmark (BM) that used the most recent observation as the forecast.
Independent IMERG observations were used as a reference, and experiments were
conducted to examine both overall statistics and case studies involving
specific precipitation events. Overall, the forecasts provided by the
Nowcasting-Net models are superior, with the Convolutional Nowcasting Network

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past few years, the success in action recognition on short trimmed
videos has led more investigations towards the temporal segmentation of actions
in untrimmed long videos. Recently, supervised approaches have achieved
excellent performance in segmenting complex human actions in untrimmed videos.
However, besides action labels, such approaches also require the start and end
points of each action, which is expensive and tedious to collect.

In this paper, we aim to learn the action segments taking only the high-level
activity labels as input. Under the setting where no action-level supervision
is provided, Hungarian matching is often used to find the mapping between
segments and ground truth actions to evaluate the model and report the
performance. On the one hand, we show that with the high-level supervision, we
are able to generalize the Hungarian matching settings from the current video
and activity level to the global level. The extended global-level matching
allows for the shared actions across activities. On the other hand, we propose
a novel action discovery framework that automatically discovers constituent
actions in videos with the activity classification task. Specifically, we
define a finite number of prototypes to form a dual representation of a video
sequence. These collectively learned prototypes are considered discovered
actions. This classification setting endows our approach the capability of
discovering potentially shared actions across multiple complex activities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the discovered actions are helpful in
performing temporal action segmentation and activity recognition.]]></summary>

yielding outstanding images, however, they are burdensome to deploy on
resource-constrained devices due to ponderous computational costs and hulking
memory usage. Although recent efforts on compressing GANs have acquired
remarkable results, they still exist potential model redundancies and can be
further compressed. To solve this issue, we propose a novel online
multi-granularity distillation (OMGD) scheme to obtain lightweight GANs, which
contributes to generating high-fidelity images with low computational demands.
We offer the first attempt to popularize single-stage online distillation for
GAN-oriented compression, where the progressively promoted teacher generator
helps to refine the discriminator-free based student generator. Complementary
teacher generators and network layers provide comprehensive and
multi-granularity concepts to enhance visual fidelity from diverse dimensions.
Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that OMGD successes
to compress 40x MACs and 82.5X parameters on Pix2Pix and CycleGAN, without loss
of image quality. It reveals that OMGD provides a feasible solution for the
deployment of real-time image translation on resource-constrained devices. Our

recognizing the color of pedestrian traffic lights, our prototype can help the
user to cross a street safely. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset named
Pedestrian and Vehicle Traffic Lights (PVTL), which is dedicated to traffic
light recognition. The result of our user study in real-world scenarios shows
that our prototype is effective and easy to use, providing new insight into

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Registration of 3D anatomic structures to their 2D dual fluoroscopic X-ray
images is a widely used motion tracking technique. However, deep learning
implementation is often impeded by a paucity of medical images and ground
truths. In this study, we proposed a transfer learning strategy for 3D-to-2D
registration using deep neural networks trained from an artificial dataset.
Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) and radiographic skull landmarks
were automatically created from craniocervical CT data of a female subject.
They were used to train a residual network (ResNet) for landmark detection and
a cycle generative adversarial network (GAN) to eliminate the style difference
between DRRs and actual X-rays. Landmarks on the X-rays experiencing GAN style
translation were detected by the ResNet, and were used in triangulation
optimization for 3D-to-2D registration of the skull in actual dual-fluoroscope
images (with a non-orthogonal setup, point X-ray sources, image distortions,
and partially captured skull regions). The registration accuracy was evaluated
in multiple scenarios of craniocervical motions. In walking, learning-based
registration for the skull had angular/position errors of 3.9 +- 2.1 deg / 4.6
+- 2.2 mm. However, the accuracy was lower during functional neck activity, due
to overly small skull regions imaged on the dual fluoroscopic images at
end-range positions. The methodology to strategically augment artificial
training data can tackle the complicated skull registration scenario, and has
potentials to extend to widespread registration scenarios.]]></summary>

that DISTANA, when combined with a retrospective latent state inference

effective waveform-based acoustic models. The waveform-based setting, inherent
to fully end-to-end speech recognition systems, is motivated by several
comparative studies of automatic and human speech recognition that associate
standard non-adaptive feature extraction techniques with information loss which
can adversely affect robustness. Stochastic neural networks, on the other hand,
are a class of models capable of incorporating rich regularization mechanisms
into the learning process. We consider a deep convolutional neural network that
first decomposes speech into frequency sub-bands via an adaptive parametric
convolutional block where filters are specified by cosine modulations of
compactly supported windows. The network then employs standard non-parametric
1D convolutions to extract relevant spectro-temporal patterns while gradually
compressing the structured high dimensional representation generated by the
parametric block. We rely on a probabilistic parametrization of the proposed
neural architecture and learn the model using stochastic variational inference.
This requires evaluation of an analytically intractable integral defining the
Kullback-Leibler divergence term responsible for regularization, for which we
propose an effective approximation based on the Gauss-Hermite quadrature. Our
empirical results demonstrate a superior performance of the proposed approach
over comparable waveform-based baselines and indicate that it could lead to
robustness. Moreover, the approach outperforms a recently proposed deep
convolutional neural network for learning of robust acoustic models with
standard FBANK features.]]></summary>

categories in pixel-wise with only few annotated samples. However, existing
approaches still face two main challenges. First, huge feature distinction
between support and query images causes knowledge transferring barrier, which
harms the segmentation performance. Second, few support samples cause
unrepresentative of support features, hardly to guide high-quality query
segmentation. To deal with the above two issues, we propose self-distillation
embedded supervised affinity attention model (SD-AANet) to improve the
performance of few-shot segmentation task. Specifically, the self-distillation
guided prototype module (SDPM) extracts intrinsic prototype by
self-distillation between support and query to capture representative features.
The supervised affinity attention module (SAAM) adopts support ground truth to
guide the production of high quality query attention map, which can learn
affinity information to focus on whole area of query target. Extensive
experiments prove that our SD-AANet significantly improves the performance
comparing with existing methods. Comprehensive ablation experiments and
visualization studies also show the significant effect of SDPM and SAAM for

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep generative models are proven to be a useful tool for automatic design
synthesis and design space exploration. When applied in engineering design,
existing generative models face three challenges: 1) generated designs lack
diversity and do not cover all areas of the design space, 2) it is difficult to
explicitly improve the overall performance or quality of generated designs, and
3) existing models generally do not generate novel designs, outside the domain
of the training data. In this paper, we simultaneously address these challenges
by proposing a new Determinantal Point Processes based loss function for
probabilistic modeling of diversity and quality. With this new loss function,
we develop a variant of the Generative Adversarial Network, named "Performance
Augmented Diverse Generative Adversarial Network" or PaDGAN, which can generate
novel high-quality designs with good coverage of the design space. Using three
synthetic examples and one real-world airfoil design example, we demonstrate
that PaDGAN can generate diverse and high-quality designs. In comparison to a
vanilla Generative Adversarial Network, on average, it generates samples with a
28% higher mean quality score with larger diversity and without the mode
collapse issue. Unlike typical generative models that usually generate new
designs by interpolating within the boundary of training data, we show that
PaDGAN expands the design space boundary outside the training data towards
high-quality regions. The proposed method is broadly applicable to many tasks
including design space exploration, design optimization, and creative solution
recommendation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To discover powerful yet compact models is an important goal of neural
architecture search. Previous two-stage one-shot approaches are limited by
search space with a fixed depth. It seems handy to include an additional skip
connection in the search space to make depths variable. However, it creates a
large range of perturbation during supernet training and it has difficulty
giving a confident ranking for subnetworks. In this paper, we discover that
skip connections bring about significant feature inconsistency compared with
other operations, which potentially degrades the supernet performance. Based on
this observation, we tackle the problem by imposing an equivariant learnable
stabilizer to homogenize such disparities. Experiments show that our proposed
stabilizer helps to improve the supernet's convergence as well as ranking
performance. With an evolutionary search backend that incorporates the
stabilized supernet as an evaluator, we derive a family of state-of-the-art
architectures, the SCARLET series of several depths, especially SCARLET-A
obtains 76.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diabetes prediction is an important data science application in the social
healthcare domain. There exist two main challenges in the diabetes prediction
task: data heterogeneity since demographic and metabolic data are of different
types, data insufficiency since the number of diabetes cases in a single
medical center is usually limited. To tackle the above challenges, we employ
gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) to handle data heterogeneity and
introduce multi-task learning (MTL) to solve data insufficiency. To this end,
Task-wise Split Gradient Boosting Trees (TSGB) is proposed for the multi-center
diabetes prediction task. Specifically, we firstly introduce task gain to
evaluate each task separately during tree construction, with a theoretical
analysis of GBDT's learning objective. Secondly, we reveal a problem when
directly applying GBDT in MTL, i.e., the negative task gain problem. Finally,
we propose a novel split method for GBDT in MTL based on the task gain
statistics, named task-wise split, as an alternative to standard feature-wise
split to overcome the mentioned negative task gain problem. Extensive
experiments on a large-scale real-world diabetes dataset and a commonly used
benchmark dataset demonstrate TSGB achieves superior performance against
several state-of-the-art methods. Detailed case studies further support our
analysis of negative task gain problems and provide insightful findings. The
proposed TSGB method has been deployed as an online diabetes risk assessment
software for early diagnosis.]]></summary>

mobile application, CITISEN, which can perform three functions: speech
enhancement (SE), acoustic scene conversion (ASC), and model adaptation (MA).
For SE, CITISEN can effectively reduce noise components from speech signals and
accordingly enhance their clarity and intelligibility. For ASC, CITISEN can
convert the current background sound to a different background sound. Finally,
for MA, CITISEN can effectively adapt an SE model, with a few audio files, when
it encounters unknown speakers or noise types; the adapted SE model is used to
enhance the upcoming noisy utterances. Experimental results confirmed the
effectiveness of CITISEN in performing these three functions via objective
evaluation and subjective listening tests. The promising results reveal that
the developed CITISEN mobile application can potentially be used as a front-end

aims to reproduce a novel speaker's voice with a few training data. While
numerous attempts have been made to the few-shot speaker adaptation system,
there is still a gap in terms of speaker similarity to the target speaker
depending on the amount of data. To bridge the gap, we propose GC-TTS which
achieves high-quality speaker adaptation with significantly improved speaker
similarity. Specifically, we leverage two geometric constraints to learn
discriminative speaker representations. Here, a TTS model is pre-trained for
base speakers with a sufficient amount of data, and then fine-tuned for novel
speakers on a few minutes of data with two geometric constraints. Two geometric
constraints enable the model to extract discriminative speaker embeddings from
limited data, which leads to the synthesis of intelligible speech. We discuss
and verify the effectiveness of GC-TTS by comparing it with popular and
essential methods. The experimental results demonstrate that GC-TTS generates
high-quality speech from only a few minutes of training data, outperforming
standard techniques in terms of speaker similarity to the target speaker.]]></summary>

more complicated schemes (coordinate-wise median, trimmed mean). Furthermore,
for communication efficiency, we consider a generic class of
$\delta$-approximate compressors from Karimireddi et al.~\cite{errorfeed} that
encompasses sign-based compressors and top-$k$ sparsification. Our algorithm
uses compressed gradients and gradient norms for aggregation and Byzantine
removal respectively. We establish the statistical error rate for non-convex
smooth loss functions. We show that, in certain range of the compression factor
$\delta$, the (order-wise) rate of convergence is not affected by the
compression operation. Moreover, we analyze the compressed gradient descent
algorithm with error feedback (proposed in \cite{errorfeed}) in a distributed

exploiting error feedback improves the statistical error rate. Finally, we

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The $Q$-function is a central quantity in many Reinforcement Learning (RL)
algorithms for which RL agents behave following a (soft)-greedy policy w.r.t.
to $Q$. It is a powerful tool that allows action selection without a model of
the environment and even without explicitly modeling the policy. Yet, this
scheme can only be used in discrete action tasks, with small numbers of
actions, as the softmax cannot be computed exactly otherwise. Especially the
usage of function approximation, to deal with continuous action spaces in
modern actor-critic architectures, intrinsically prevents the exact computation
of a softmax. We propose to alleviate this issue by parametrizing the
$Q$-function implicitly, as the sum of a log-policy and of a value function. We
use the resulting parametrization to derive a practical off-policy deep RL
algorithm, suitable for large action spaces, and that enforces the softmax
relation between the policy and the $Q$-value. We provide a theoretical
analysis of our algorithm: from an Approximate Dynamic Programming perspective,
we show its equivalence to a regularized version of value iteration, accounting
for both entropy and Kullback-Leibler regularization, and that enjoys
beneficial error propagation results. We then evaluate our algorithm on classic
control tasks, where its results compete with state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

called ProtoryNet, based on a new concept of prototype trajectories. Motivated
by the prototype theory in modern linguistics, ProtoryNet makes a prediction by
finding the most similar prototype for each sentence in a text sequence and
feeding an RNN backbone with the proximity of each sentence to the
corresponding active prototype. The RNN backbone then captures the temporal
pattern of the prototypes, which we refer to as prototype trajectories.
Prototype trajectories enable intuitive and fine-grained interpretation of the
reasoning process of the RNN model, in resemblance to how humans analyze texts.
We also design a prototype pruning procedure to reduce the total number of
prototypes used by the model for better interpretability. Experiments on
multiple public data sets show that ProtoryNet is more accurate than the
baseline prototype-based deep neural net and reduces the performance gap
compared to state-of-the-art black-box models. In addition, after prototype
pruning, the resulting ProtoryNet models only need less than or around 20
prototypes for all datasets, which significantly benefits interpretability.
Furthermore, we report a survey result indicating that human users find
ProtoryNet more intuitive and easier to understand than other prototype-based
methods.]]></summary>

dataset for action recognition on 500 classes with over 591K labeled frames. To
minimize ambiguities in action classification, HAA500 consists of highly
diversified classes of fine-grained atomic actions, where only consistent
actions fall under the same label, e.g., "Baseball Pitching" vs "Free Throw in
Basketball". Thus HAA500 is different from existing atomic action datasets,
where coarse-grained atomic actions were labeled with coarse action-verbs such
as "Throw". HAA500 has been carefully curated to capture the precise movement
of human figures with little class-irrelevant motions or spatio-temporal label
noises. The advantages of HAA500 are fourfold: 1) human-centric actions with a
high average of 69.7% detectable joints for the relevant human poses; 2) high
scalability since adding a new class can be done under 20-60 minutes; 3)
curated videos capturing essential elements of an atomic action without
irrelevant frames; 4) fine-grained atomic action classes. Our extensive

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Failure trajectories, identifying the probable failure zones, and damage
statistics are some of the key quantities of relevance in brittle fracture
applications. High-fidelity numerical solvers that reliably estimate these
relevant quantities exist but they are computationally demanding requiring a
high resolution of the crack. Moreover, independent intensive simulations need
to be carried out even for a small change in domain parameters and/or material
properties. Therefore, fast and generalizable surrogate models are needed to
alleviate the computational burden but the discontinuous nature of fracture
mechanics presents a major challenge to developing such models. We propose a
physics-informed variational formulation of DeepONet (V-DeepONet) for brittle
fracture analysis. V-DeepONet is trained to map the initial configuration of
the defect to the relevant fields of interests (e.g., damage and displacement
fields). Once the network is trained, the entire global solution can be rapidly
obtained for any initial crack configuration and loading steps on that domain.
While the original DeepONet is solely data-driven, we take a different path to
train the V-DeepONet by imposing the governing equations in variational form
and we also use some labelled data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
V-DeepOnet through two benchmarks of brittle fracture, and we verify its
accuracy using results from high-fidelity solvers. Encoding the physical laws
and also some data to train the network renders the surrogate model capable of
accurately performing both interpolation and extrapolation tasks, considering
that fracture modeling is very sensitive to fluctuations. The proposed hybrid
training of V-DeepONet is superior to state-of-the-art methods and can be
applied to a wide array of dynamical systems with complex responses.]]></summary>

data-hungry neural models, as they must create complex structured objects as
outputs. Estimating such models from data may be challenging due to the lack of
sufficient training data. In this paper, we propose a surprisingly effective
self-training approach for iteratively creating additional molecular targets.
We first pre-train the generative model together with a simple property
predictor. The property predictor is then used as a likelihood model for
filtering candidate structures from the generative model. Additional targets
are iteratively produced and used in the course of stochastic EM iterations to
maximize the log-likelihood that the candidate structures are accepted. A
simple rejection (re-weighting) sampler suffices to draw posterior samples
since the generative model is already reasonable after pre-training. We
demonstrate significant gains over strong baselines for both unconditional and
conditional molecular design. In particular, our approach outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art in conditional molecular design by over 10% in
absolute gain. Finally, we show that our approach is useful in other domains as
well, such as program synthesis.]]></summary>

runtime future violations of a system from the current state. We work under the
most realistic settings where only partial and noisy observations of the state
are available at runtime. Such settings directly affect the accuracy and
reliability of the reachability predictions, jeopardizing the safety of the
system. In this work, we present a learning-based method for PM that produces
accurate and reliable reachability predictions despite partial observability
(PO). We build on Neural Predictive Monitoring (NPM), a PM method that uses
deep neural networks for approximating hybrid systems reachability, and extend
it to the PO case. We propose and compare two solutions, an end-to-end
approach, which directly operates on the rough observations, and a two-step
approach, which introduces an intermediate state estimation step. Both
solutions rely on conformal prediction to provide 1) probabilistic guarantees
in the form of prediction regions and 2) sound estimates of predictive
uncertainty. We use the latter to identify unreliable (and likely erroneous)
predictions and to retrain and improve the monitors on these uncertain inputs
(i.e., active learning). Our method results in highly accurate reachability
predictions and error detection, as well as tight prediction regions with
guaranteed coverage.]]></summary>

activity and muscle morphology. Experts accurately diagnose neuromuscular
disorders using this time series. Modern data analysis techniques have recently
led to introducing novel approaches for mapping time series data to graphs and
complex networks with applications in diverse fields, including medicine. The
resulting networks develop a completely different visual acuity that can be
used to complement physician findings of time series. This can lead to a more
enriched analysis, reduced error, more accurate diagnosis of the disease, and
increased accuracy and speed of the treatment process. The mapping process may
cause the loss of essential data from the time series and not retain all the
time series features. As a result, achieving an approach that can provide a
good representation of the time series while maintaining essential features is
crucial. This paper proposes a new approach to network development named
GraphTS to overcome the limited accuracy of existing methods through EMG time
series using the visibility graph method. For this purpose, EMG signals are
pre-processed and mapped to a complex network by a standard visibility graph
algorithm. The resulting networks can differentiate between healthy and patient
samples. In the next step, the properties of the developed networks are given
in the form of a feature matrix as input to classifiers after extracting
optimal features. Performance evaluation of the proposed approach with deep
neural network shows 99.30% accuracy for training data and 99.18% for test
data. Therefore, in addition to enriched network representation and covering
the features of time series for healthy, myopathy, and neuropathy EMG, the
proposed technique improves accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score.]]></summary>

and grid operators. To defend against such events, it is necessary to identify
the causes of interruptions in the power distribution network. In this work, we
focus on the power grid of a Norwegian community in the Arctic that experiences
several faults whose sources are unknown. First, we construct a data set
consisting of relevant meteorological data and information about the current
power quality logged by power-quality meters. Then, we adopt machine-learning
techniques to predict the occurrence of faults. Experimental results show that
both linear and non-linear classifiers achieve good classification performance.
This indicates that the considered power-quality and weather variables explain
well the power disturbances. Interpreting the decision process of the
classifiers provides valuable insights to understand the main causes of
disturbances. Traditional features selection methods can only indicate which
are the variables that, on average, mostly explain the fault occurrences in the
dataset. Besides providing such a global interpretation, it is also important
to identify the specific set of variables that explain each individual fault.
To address this challenge, we adopt a recent technique to interpret the
decision process of a deep learning model, called Integrated Gradients. The
proposed approach allows to gain detailed insights on the occurrence of a
specific fault, which are valuable for the distribution system operators to
implement strategies to prevent and mitigate power disturbances.]]></summary>

and quality of life. Monitoring stations have been established to continuously
obtain air quality information, but they do not cover all areas. Thus, there
are numerous methods for spatially fine-grained air quality inference. Since
existing methods aim to infer air quality of locations only in monitored
cities, they do not assume inferring air quality in unmonitored cities. In this
paper, we first study the air quality inference in unmonitored cities. To
accurately infer air quality in unmonitored cities, we propose a neural
network-based approach AIREX. The novelty of AIREX is employing a
mixture-of-experts approach, which is a machine learning technique based on the
divide-and-conquer principle, to learn correlations of air quality between
multiple cities. To further boost the performance, it employs attention
mechanisms to compute impacts of air quality inference from the monitored
cities to the locations in the unmonitored city. We show, through experiments
on a real-world air quality dataset, that AIREX achieves higher accuracy than
state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

development of advanced machine learning techniques. Although much attention
has been paid to large and complex data sets resulting from high-throughput
sequencing, advances in high-quality video recording technology have begun to
generate similarly rich data sets requiring sophisticated techniques from both
computer vision and time-series analysis. Moreover, just as studying gene
expression patterns in one organism can reveal general principles that apply to
other organisms, the study of complex social interactions in an experimentally
tractable model system, such as a laboratory ant colony, can provide general
principles about the dynamics of other social groups. Here, we focus on one
such example from the study of reproductive regulation in small laboratory
colonies of more than 50 Harpegnathos ants. These ants can be artificially
induced to begin a ~20 day process of hierarchy reformation. Although the
conclusion of this process is conspicuous to a human observer, it remains
unclear which behaviors during the transient period are contributing to the
process. To address this issue, we explore the potential application of
One-class Classification (OC) to the detection of abnormal states in ant
colonies for which behavioral data is only available for the normal societal
conditions during training. Specifically, we build upon the Deep Support Vector
Data Description (DSVDD) and introduce the Inner-Outlier Generator (IO-GEN)
that synthesizes fake "inner outlier" observations during training that are
near the center of the DSVDD data description. We show that IO-GEN increases
the reliability of the final OC classifier relative to other DSVDD baselines.
This method can be used to screen video frames for which additional human
observation is needed.]]></summary>

are allowed to communicate. The MAS runs over an underlying Markov decision
process and its task is to maximize the averaged sum of discounted one-stage
rewards. Although knowing the global state of the environment is necessary for
the optimal action selection of the MAS, agents are limited to individual
observations. Inter-agent communication can tackle the issue of local
observability, however, the limited rate of inter-agent communication prevents
the agents from acquiring the precise global state information. To overcome
this challenge, agents need to communicate an abstract version of their
observations to each other such that the MAS compromises the minimum possible
sum of rewards. We show that this problem is equivalent to a form of
rate-distortion problem, which we call task-based information compression
(TBIC). We introduce state aggregation for information compression (SAIC) to

neural networks (CNNs) over the past few decades, they can easily reach or even
exceed the performance of humans in certain tasks. However, a recently
discovered shortcoming of CNNs is that they are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. Although the adversarial robustness of CNNs can be improved by
adversarial training, there is a trade-off between standard accuracy and
adversarial robustness. From the neural architecture perspective, this paper
aims to improve the adversarial robustness of the backbone CNNs that have a
satisfactory accuracy. Under a minimal computational overhead, the introduction
of a dilation architecture is expected to be friendly with the standard
performance of the backbone CNN while pursuing adversarial robustness.
Theoretical analyses on the standard and adversarial error bounds naturally
motivate the proposed neural architecture dilation algorithm. Experimental
results on real-world datasets and benchmark neural networks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to balance the accuracy and adversarial

feature aggregation in a straightforward way using the pooling layers, graphs
lack the tensor representation and mostly the element-wise max/mean function is

present a novel approach for global feature aggregation in Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) which utilizes a Latent Fixed Data Structure (LFDS) to
aggregate the extracted feature vectors. The locally extracted feature vectors
are sorted/distributed on the LFDS and a latent neural network (CNN/GNN) is
utilized to perform feature aggregation on the LFDS. The proposed approach is
used to design several novel global feature aggregation methods based on the
choice of the LFDS. We introduce multiple LFDSs including loop, 3D tensor
(image), sequence, data driven graphs and an algorithm which sorts/distributes
the extracted local feature vectors on the LFDS. While the computational
complexity of the proposed methods are linear with the order of input graphs,
they achieve competitive or better results.]]></summary>

changes in the statistics of processed data typically has a profound influence
on the performance of trained models. Most of the available drift detection
methods require access to true labels during inference time. In a real-world
scenario, true labels usually available only during model training. In this
work, we propose a novel task-sensitive drift detection framework, which is
able to detect drifts without access to true labels during inference. It
utilizes metric learning of a constrained low-dimensional embedding
representation of the input data, which is best suited for the classification
task. It is able to detect real drift, where the drift affects the
classification performance, while it properly ignores virtual drift, where the
classification performance is not affected by the drift. In the proposed
framework, the actual method to detect a change in the statistics of incoming
data samples can be chosen freely. We also propose the two change detection
methods, which are based on the exponential moving average and a modified
$z$-score, respectively. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework
with a novel metric, which accumulates the standard metrics of detection
accuracy, false positive rate and detection delay into one value. Experimental
evaluation on nine benchmarks datasets, with different types of drift,
demonstrates that the proposed framework can reliably detect drifts, and
outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised drift detection approaches.]]></summary>

local gradients or parameters rather than raw data, the adversary still can
leverage local gradients and parameters to obtain local training data by
launching reconstruction and membership inference attacks. To defend such
privacy attacks, many noises perturbation methods (like differential privacy or
CountSketch matrix) have been widely designed. However, the strong defence
ability and high learning accuracy of these schemes cannot be ensured at the
same time, which will impede the wide application of FL in practice (especially
for medical or financial institutions that require both high accuracy and
strong privacy guarantee). To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose
\emph{an efficient model perturbation method for federated learning} to defend
reconstruction and membership inference attacks launched by curious clients. On
the one hand, similar to the differential privacy, our method also selects
random numbers as perturbed noises added to the global model parameters, and
thus it is very efficient and easy to be integrated in practice. Meanwhile, the
random selected noises are positive real numbers and the corresponding value
can be arbitrarily large, and thus the strong defence ability can be ensured.
On the other hand, unlike differential privacy or other perturbation methods
that cannot eliminate the added noises, our method allows the server to recover
the true gradients by eliminating the added noises. Therefore, our method does
not hinder learning accuracy at all.]]></summary>

control of nonlinear multivariable dynamic systems with constraints, which
however requires an accurate plant model. Plant models can often be determined
from first principles, parts of the model are however difficult to derive using
physical laws alone. In this paper a hybrid Gaussian process (GP) first
principles modeling scheme is proposed to overcome this issue, which exploits
GPs to model the parts of the dynamic system that are difficult to describe
using first principles. GPs not only give accurate predictions, but also
quantify the residual uncertainty of this model. It is vital to account for
this uncertainty in the control algorithm, to prevent constraint violations and
performance deterioration. Monte Carlo samples of the GPs are generated offline
to tighten constraints of the NMPC to ensure joint probabilistic constraint
satisfaction online. Advantages of our method include fast online evaluation
times, possibility to account for online learning alleviating conservativeness,
and exploiting the flexibility of GPs and the data efficiency of first
principle models. The algorithm is verified on a case study involving a

multitude of participants to construct a joint ML model without exposing their
private training data. Existing FL designs have been shown to exhibit
vulnerabilities which can be exploited by adversaries both within and outside
of the system to compromise data privacy. However, most current works conduct
attacks by leveraging gradients on a small batch of data, which is less
practical in FL. In this work, we consider a more practical and interesting
scenario in which participants share their epoch-averaged gradients (share
gradients after at least 1 epoch of local training) rather than per-example or
small batch-averaged gradients as in previous works. We perform the first
systematic evaluation of attribute reconstruction attack (ARA) launched by the
malicious server in the FL system, and empirically demonstrate that the shared
epoch-averaged local model gradients can reveal sensitive attributes of local
training data of any victim participant. To achieve this goal, we develop a
more effective and efficient gradient matching based method called cos-matching
to reconstruct the training data attributes. We evaluate our attacks on a
variety of real-world datasets, scenarios, assumptions. Our experiments show
that our proposed method achieves better attribute attack performance than most

traffic congestion propagation has become crucial in GPS navigation systems for
providing users with a more accurate estimated time of arrival (ETA). However,
providing the exact ETA during congestion is a challenge owing to the complex
propagation process between roads and high uncertainty regarding the future
behavior of the process. Recent studies have focused on finding frequent
congestion propagation patterns and determining the propagation probabilities.
By contrast, this study proposes a novel time delay estimation method for
traffic congestion propagation between roads using lag-specific transfer
entropy (TE). Nonlinear normalization with a sliding window is used to
effectively reveal the causal relationship between the source and target time
series in calculating the TE. Moreover, Markov bootstrap techniques were
adopted to quantify the uncertainty in the time delay estimator. To the best of
our knowledge, the time delay estimation method presented in this article is
the first to determine the time delay between roads for any congestion
propagation pattern. The proposed method was validated using simulated data as
well as real user trajectory data obtained from a major GPS navigation system

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Actor-critic (AC) algorithms are known for their efficacy and high
performance in solving reinforcement learning problems, but they also suffer
from low sampling efficiency. An AC based policy optimization process is
iterative and needs to frequently access the agent-environment system to
evaluate and update the policy by rolling out the policy, collecting rewards
and states (i.e. samples), and learning from them. It ultimately requires a
huge number of samples to learn an optimal policy. To improve sampling
efficiency, we propose a strategy to optimize the training dataset that
contains significantly less samples collected from the AC process. The dataset
optimization is made of a best episode only operation, a policy
parameter-fitness model, and a genetic algorithm module. The optimal policy
network trained by the optimized training dataset exhibits superior performance
compared to many contemporary AC algorithms in controlling autonomous dynamical
systems. Evaluation on standard benchmarks show that the method improves
sampling efficiency, ensures faster convergence to optima, and is more
data-efficient than its counterparts.]]></summary>

To address these issues, we first propose a novel dense-sparse training flow

adjacent slices are extracted as inputs for regularizing DCNNs, thereby
improving the model performance. Moreover, we design a 2.5D light-weight

machine learning (ML) has garnered immense interest in the research community.
However, these ML models turn out to be black boxes, which are tough to
interpret, resulting in a direct decrease in productivity. Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) is a popular technique for explaining the
prediction of a single instance. Although LIME is simple and versatile, it
suffers from instability in the generated explanations. In this paper, we
propose a Gaussian Process (GP) based variation of locally interpretable
models. We employ a smart sampling strategy based on the acquisition functions
in Bayesian optimization. Further, we employ the automatic relevance
determination based covariance function in GP, with separate length-scale
parameters for each feature, where the reciprocal of lengthscale parameters
serve as feature explanations. We illustrate the performance of the proposed
technique on two real-world datasets, and demonstrate the superior stability of
the proposed technique. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed technique
is able to generate faithful explanations using much fewer samples as compared

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, Neural Machine Translator (NMT) has shown promise in
automatically editing source code. Typical NMT based code editor only considers
the code that needs to be changed as input and suggests developers with a
ranked list of patched code to choose from - where the correct one may not
always be at the top of the list. While NMT based code editing systems generate
a broad spectrum of plausible patches, the correct one depends on the
developers' requirement and often on the context where the patch is applied.
Thus, if developers provide some hints, using natural language, or providing
patch context, NMT models can benefit from them. As a proof of concept, in this
research, we leverage three modalities of information: edit location, edit code
context, commit messages (as a proxy of developers' hint in natural language)
to automatically generate edits with NMT models. To that end, we build MODIT, a
multi-modal NMT based code editing engine. With in-depth investigation and
analysis, we show that developers' hint as an input modality can narrow the
search space for patches and outperform state-of-the-art models to generate
correctly patched code in top-1 position.]]></summary>

describes the ability to learn several tasks sequentially without catastrophic
forgetting (CF). Recent works indicate that CL is a complex topic, even more so
when real-world scenarios with multiple constraints are involved. Several
solution classes have been proposed, of which so-called replay-based approaches
seem very promising due to their simplicity and robustness. Such approaches
store a subset of past samples in a dedicated memory for later processing:
while this does not solve all problems, good results have been obtained. In
this article, we empirically investigate replay-based approaches of continual
learning and assess their potential for applications. Selected recent
approaches as well as own proposals are compared on a common set of benchmarks,
with a particular focus on assessing the performance of different sample
selection strategies. We find that the impact of sample selection increases
when a smaller number of samples is stored. Nevertheless, performance varies
strongly between different replay approaches. Surprisingly, we find that the
most naive rehearsal-based approaches that we propose here can outperform
recent state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

recommendation systems and traffic prediction, given the rich node features and
edges information. However, these high-dimensional features and high-order
adjacency information are usually heterogeneous and held by different data
holders in practice. Given such vertical data partition (e.g., one data holder
will only own either the node features or edge information), different data
holders have to develop efficient joint training protocols rather than directly
transfer data to each other due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we focus on
the edge privacy, and consider a training scenario where Bob with node features
will first send training node features to Alice who owns the adjacency
information. Alice will then train a graph neural network (GNN) with the joint
information and release an inference API. During inference, Bob is able to
provide test node features and query the API to obtain the predictions for test
nodes. Under this setting, we first propose a privacy attack LinkTeller via
influence analysis to infer the private edge information held by Alice via
designing adversarial queries for Bob. We then empirically show that LinkTeller
is able to recover a significant amount of private edges, outperforming
existing baselines. To further evaluate the privacy leakage, we adapt an
existing algorithm for differentially private graph convolutional network (DP
GCN) training and propose a new DP GCN mechanism LapGraph. We show that these
DP GCN mechanisms are not always resilient against LinkTeller empirically under
mild privacy guarantees ($\varepsilon>5$). Our studies will shed light on
future research towards designing more resilient privacy-preserving GCN models;
in the meantime, provide an in-depth understanding of the tradeoff between GCN
model utility and robustness against potential privacy attacks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite the impressive clustering performance and efficiency in
characterizing both the relationship between data and cluster structure,
existing graph-based multi-view clustering methods still have the following
drawbacks. They suffer from the expensive time burden due to both the
construction of graphs and eigen-decomposition of Laplacian matrix, and fail to
explore the cluster structure of large-scale data. Moreover, they require a
post-processing to get the final clustering, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Furthermore, rank of the learned view-consensus graph cannot
approximate the target rank. In this paper, drawing the inspiration from the
bipartite graph, we propose an effective and efficient graph learning model for
multi-view clustering. Specifically, our method exploits the view-similar
between graphs of different views by the minimization of tensor Schatten
p-norm, which well characterizes both the spatial structure and complementary
information embedded in graphs of different views. We learn view-consensus
graph with adaptively weighted strategy and connectivity constraint such that
the connected components indicates clusters directly. Our proposed algorithm is
time-economical and obtains the stable results and scales well with the data
size. Extensive experimental results indicate that our method is superior to
state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We propose a unified framework to study policy evaluation (PE) and the
associated temporal difference (TD) methods for reinforcement learning in
continuous time and space. We show that PE is equivalent to maintaining the
martingale condition of a process. From this perspective, we find that the
mean--square TD error approximates the quadratic variation of the martingale
and thus is not a suitable objective for PE. We present two methods to use the
martingale characterization for designing PE algorithms. The first one
minimizes a "martingale loss function", whose solution is proved to be the best
approximation of the true value function in the mean--square sense. This method
interprets the classical gradient Monte-Carlo algorithm. The second method is
based on a system of equations called the "martingale orthogonality conditions"
with "test functions". Solving these equations in different ways recovers
various classical TD algorithms, such as TD($\lambda$), LSTD, and GTD.
Different choices of test functions determine in what sense the resulting
solutions approximate the true value function. Moreover, we prove that any
convergent time-discretized algorithm converges to its continuous-time
counterpart as the mesh size goes to zero. We demonstrate the theoretical
results and corresponding algorithms with numerical experiments and
applications.]]></summary>

place. In this competition, the players are provided with a real-world
city-scale road network and its traffic demand derived from real traffic data.
The players are asked to coordinate the traffic signals with a self-designed
agent to maximize the number of vehicles served while maintaining an acceptable
delay. In this abstract paper, we present an overall analysis and our detailed
solution to this competition. Our approach is mainly based on the adaptation of
the deep Q-network (DQN) for real-time traffic signal control. From our
perspective, the major challenge of this competition is how to extend the
classical DQN framework to traffic signals control in real-world complex road
network and traffic flow situation. After trying and implementing several
classical reward functions, we finally chose to apply our newly-designed reward
in our agent. By applying our newly-proposed reward function and carefully
tuning the control scheme, an agent based on a single DQN model can rank among
the top 15 teams. We hope this paper could serve, to some extent, as a baseline

collected from high-dimensional ambient space lie in a union of linear
subspaces. Subspace clustering becomes challenging when the dimension of
intersection between subspaces is large and most of the self-representation
based methods are sensitive to the intersection between the span of clusters.
In sharp contrast to the self-representation based methods, a recently proposed
clustering method termed Innovation Pursuit, computed a set of optimal
directions (directions of innovation) to build the adjacency matrix. This paper
focuses on the Innovation Pursuit Algorithm to shed light on its impressive
performance when the subspaces are heavily intersected. It is shown that in
contrast to most of the existing methods which require the subspaces to be
sufficiently incoherent with each other, Innovation Pursuit only requires the
innovative components of the subspaces to be sufficiently incoherent with each
other. These new sufficient conditions allow the clusters to be strongly close
to each other. Motivated by the presented theoretical analysis, a simple yet
effective projection based technique is proposed which we show with both
numerical and theoretical results that it can boost the performance of
Innovation Pursuit.]]></summary>

for toxicity comment detection. Deeper analysis reveals the findings that such
automatic models are particularly biased to specific identity groups even

has been enhancing the traditional security control mechanisms to an advanced
level so that automated tools can encounter potential security threats. Very
recently a term, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) has been represented as one of
the proactive and robust mechanisms because of its automated cybersecurity
threat prediction based on data. In general, CTI collects and analyses data
from various sources e.g. online security forums, social media where cyber
enthusiasts, analysts, even cybercriminals discuss cyber or computer security
related topics and discovers potential threats based on the analysis. As the
manual analysis of every such discussion i.e. posts on online platforms is
time-consuming, inefficient, and susceptible to errors, CTI as an automated
tool can perform uniquely to detect cyber threats. In this paper, our goal is
to identify and explore relevant CTI from hacker forums by using different
supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. To this end, we collect data
from a real hacker forum and constructed two datasets: a binary dataset and a
multi-class dataset. Our binary dataset contains two classes one containing
cybersecurity-relevant posts and another one containing posts that are not
related to security. This dataset is constructed using simple keyword search
technique. Using a similar approach, we further categorize posts from
security-relevant posts into five different threat categories. We then applied
several machine learning classifiers along with deep neural network-based
classifiers and use them on the datasets to compare their performances. We also
tested the classifiers on a leaked dataset with labels named nulled.io as our
ground truth. We further explore the datasets using unsupervised techniques
i.e. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization
(NMF).]]></summary>

hazard warnings (e.g., for flash floods or landslides). Current remotely sensed
precipitation products have a few hours of latency, associated with the
acquisition and processing of satellite data. By applying a robust nowcasting
system to these products, it is (in principle) possible to reduce this latency
and improve their applicability, value, and impact. However, the development of
such a system is complicated by the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, and the
consequent rapid changes that can occur in the structures of precipitation
systems In this work, we develop two approaches (hereafter referred to as
Nowcasting-Nets) that use Recurrent and Convolutional deep neural network
structures to address the challenge of precipitation nowcasting. A total of
five models are trained using Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Integrated
Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) precipitation data over the Eastern
Contiguous United States (CONUS) and then tested against independent data for
the Eastern and Western CONUS. The models were designed to provide forecasts
with a lead time of up to 1.5 hours and, by using a feedback loop approach, the
ability of the models to extend the forecast time to 4.5 hours was also
investigated. Model performance was compared against the Random Forest (RF) and
Linear Regression (LR) machine learning methods, and also against a persistence
benchmark (BM) that used the most recent observation as the forecast.
Independent IMERG observations were used as a reference, and experiments were
conducted to examine both overall statistics and case studies involving
specific precipitation events. Overall, the forecasts provided by the
Nowcasting-Net models are superior, with the Convolutional Nowcasting Network

rule-based agents with rational agents whose behaviors are driven to maximize
rewards, the MPS provides a better approximation of real world dynamics. To
efficiently simulate with massive amounts of agents in MPS, we propose Scalable

impact of different government strategies. This paper first calibrates the MPS
against real-world data in Allegheny, US, then demonstratively evaluates two

Deep Learning models. We explore the relationship between the dropout rate and
model complexity by training 2,000 neural networks configured with random
combinations of the dropout rate and the number of hidden units in each dense
layer, on each of the three data sets we selected. The generated figures, with
binary cross entropy loss and binary accuracy on the z-axis, question the
common assumption that adding depth to a dense layer while increasing the
dropout rate will certainly enhance performance. We also discover a complex
correlation between the two hyperparameters that we proceed to quantify by
building additional machine learning and Deep Learning models which predict the
optimal dropout rate given some hidden units in each dense layer. Linear
regression and polynomial logistic regression require the use of arbitrary
thresholds to select the cost data points included in the regression and to
assign the cost data points a binary classification, respectively. These
machine learning models have mediocre performance because their naive nature
prevented the modeling of complex decision boundaries. Turning to Deep Learning
models, we build neural networks that predict the optimal dropout rate given
the number of hidden units in each dense layer, the desired cost, and the
desired accuracy of the model. Though, this attempt encounters a mathematical
error that can be attributed to the failure of the vertical line test. The
ultimate Deep Learning model is a neural network whose decision boundary
represents the 2,000 previously generated data points. This final model leads
us to devise a promising method for tuning hyperparameters to minimize
computational expense yet maximize performance. The strategy can be applied to
any model hyperparameters, with the prospect of more efficient tuning in
industrial models.]]></summary>

mainly employed deep neural networks to learn the normal patterns of temporal
data in an unsupervised manner. Unlike them, the goal of our work is to fully
utilize instance-level (or weak) anomaly labels, which only indicate whether
any anomalous events occurred or not in each instance of temporal data. In this
paper, we present WETAS, a novel framework that effectively identifies
anomalous temporal segments (i.e., consecutive time points) in an input
instance. WETAS learns discriminative features from the instance-level labels
so that it infers the sequential order of normal and anomalous segments within
each instance, which can be used as a rough segmentation mask. Based on the
dynamic time warping (DTW) alignment between the input instance and its
segmentation mask, WETAS obtains the result of temporal segmentation, and
simultaneously, it further enhances itself by using the mask as additional
supervision. Our experiments show that WETAS considerably outperforms other
baselines in terms of the localization of temporal anomalies, and also it
provides more informative results than point-level detection methods.]]></summary>

high-dimensional assisted score-based generative model for color image
restoration tasks. Considering that the sample number and internal dimension in
score-based generative model have key influence on estimating the gradients of
data distribution, two different high-dimensional ways are proposed: The
channel-copy transformation increases the sample number and the pixel-scale
transformation decreases feasible space dimension. Subsequently, a set of
high-dimensional tensors represented by these transformations are used to train
the network through denoising score matching. Then, sampling is performed by
annealing Langevin dynamics and alternative data-consistency update.
Furthermore, to alleviate the difficulty of learning high-dimensional
representation, a progressive strategy is proposed to leverage the performance.
The proposed unsupervised learning and iterative restoration algo-rithm, which
involves a pre-trained generative network to obtain prior, has transparent and
clear interpretation compared to other data-driven approaches. Experimental
results on demosaicking and inpainting conveyed the remarkable performance and

ranging from computer networking to bioinformatics. While there are many
algorithms that perform community detection, the more accurate and
statistically robust algorithms tend to be slow and hard to parallelize. One
way to speed up such algorithms is through data reduction. However, this
approach has not been thoroughly studied, and the quality of results obtained
with this approach varies with the graph it is applied to. In this manuscript,
we present an approach based on topology-guided sampling for accelerating
stochastic block partitioning - a community detection algorithm that works well
on graphs with complex and heterogeneous community structure. We also introduce
a degree-based thresholding scheme that improves the efficacy of our approach
at the expense of speedup. Finally, we perform a series of experiments on
synthetically generated graphs to determine how various graph parameters affect
the quality of results and speedup obtained with our approach, and we validate
our approach on real-world data. Our results show that our approach can lead to
a speedup of up to 15X over stochastic block partitioning without sampling
while maintaining result quality and can even lead to improvements of over 150%
in result quality in terms of F1 score on certain kinds of graphs.]]></summary>

extracting intrinsic network features and have drawn unprecedented popularity
in both academia and industry. Most of the state-of-the-art GNN models offer

recommender systems with rich network features that are computationally
difficult to leverage with graph traversal based methods.

Most recent GNNs follow an encoder-decoder paradigm to encode high
dimensional heterogeneous information from a subgraph onto one low dimensional
embedding space. However, one single embedding space usually fails to capture
all aspects of graph signals. In this work, we propose boosting-based meta
learner for GNNs, which automatically learns multiple projections and the
corresponding embedding spaces that captures different aspects of the graph
signals. As a result, similarities between sub-graphs are quantified by
embedding proximity on multiple embedding spaces. AdaGNN performs exceptionally
well for applications with rich and diverse node neighborhood information.
Moreover, AdaGNN is compatible with any inductive GNNs for both node-level and

renewable energies outputs on microgrid operation, an optimal scheduling model
is proposed for isolated microgrids by using automated reinforcement
learning-based multi-period forecasting of renewable power generations and
loads. Firstly, a prioritized experience replay automated reinforcement
learning (PER-AutoRL) is designed to simplify the deployment of deep
reinforcement learning (DRL)-based forecasting model in a customized manner,
the single-step multi-period forecasting method based on PER-AutoRL is proposed
for the first time to address the error accumulation issue suffered by existing
multi-step forecasting methods, then the prediction values obtained by the
proposed forecasting method are revised via the error distribution to improve
the prediction accuracy; secondly, a scheduling model considering demand
response is constructed to minimize the total microgrid operating costs, where
the revised forecasting values are used as the dispatch basis, and a spinning
reserve chance constraint is set according to the error distribution; finally,
by transforming the original scheduling model into a readily solvable mixed
integer linear programming via the sequence operation theory (SOT), the
transformed model is solved by using CPLEX solver. The simulation results show
that compared with the traditional scheduling model without forecasting, this
approach manages to significantly reduce the system operating costs by
improving the prediction accuracy.]]></summary>

projection-based reduced order modelling. Many methodologies that have recently
been proposed are based on the pre-processing of the full-order solutions to

knowledge of the characteristic speeds in phase space of the solution, limiting
their range of applicability to problems with explicit functional form for the

in order for RL agents to learn to perform complex tasks. Recent progress in
model-based RL allows agents to be much more data-efficient, as it enables them
to learn behaviors of visual environments in imagination by leveraging an
internal World Model of the environment. Improved sample efficiency can also be
achieved by reusing knowledge from previously learned tasks, but transfer
learning is still a challenging topic in RL. Parameter-based transfer learning
is generally done using an all-or-nothing approach, where the network's
parameters are either fully transferred or randomly initialized. In this work
we present a simple alternative approach: fractional transfer learning. The
idea is to transfer fractions of knowledge, opposed to discarding potentially
useful knowledge as is commonly done with random initialization. Using the
World Model-based Dreamer algorithm, we identify which type of components this
approach is applicable to, and perform experiments in a new multi-source
transfer learning setting. The results show that fractional transfer learning
often leads to substantially improved performance and faster learning compared

classification tasks with separable data, and demonstrate provable algorithmic
regularization effects associated with BPPA. We show that BPPA attains
non-trivial margin, which closely depends on the condition number of the
distance generating function inducing the Bregman divergence. We further
demonstrate that the dependence on the condition number is tight for a class of
problems, thus showing the importance of divergence in affecting the quality of
the obtained solutions. In addition, we extend our findings to mirror descent
(MD), for which we establish similar connections between the margin and Bregman
divergence. We demonstrate through a concrete example, and show BPPA/MD
converges in direction to the maximal margin solution with respect to the
Mahalanobis distance. Our theoretical findings are among the first to

complexity, and depth. Training model parameters by backpropagation inherently
creates feedback loops. These loops hinder efficient pipelining and scheduling
of the tasks within the layer and between consecutive layers. Prior approaches,
such as PipeDream, have exploited the use of delayed gradient to achieve
inter-layer pipelining. However, these approaches treat the entire
backpropagation as a single task; this leads to an increase in computation time
and processor underutilization. This paper presents novel optimization
approaches where the gradient computations with respect to the weights and the
activation functions are considered independently; therefore, these can be
computed in parallel. This is referred to as intra-layer optimization.
Additionally, the gradient computation with respect to the activation function
is further divided into two parts and distributed to two consecutive layers.
This leads to balanced scheduling where the computation time of each layer is
the same. This is referred to as inter-layer optimization. The proposed system,
referred to as LayerPipe, reduces the number of clock cycles required for
training while maximizing processor utilization with minimal inter-processor
communication overhead. LayerPipe achieves an average speedup of 25% and
upwards of 80% with 7 to 9 processors with less communication overhead when

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In machine learning (ML) applications, unfair predictions may discriminate
against a minority group. Most existing approaches for fair machine learning
(FML) treat fairness as a constraint or a penalization term in the optimization
of a ML model, which does not lead to the discovery of the complete landscape
of the trade-offs among learning accuracy and fairness metrics, and does not
integrate fairness in a meaningful way.

Recently, we have introduced a new paradigm for FML based on Stochastic
Multi-Objective Optimization (SMOO), where accuracy and fairness metrics stand
as conflicting objectives to be optimized simultaneously. The entire trade-offs
range is defined as the Pareto front of the SMOO problem, which can then be
efficiently computed using stochastic-gradient type algorithms. SMOO also
allows defining and computing new meaningful predictors for FML, a novel one
being the Sharpe predictor that we introduce and explore in this paper, and
which gives the highest ratio of accuracy-to-unfairness. Inspired from SMOO in
finance, the Sharpe predictor for FML provides the highest prediction return
(accuracy) per unit of prediction risk (unfairness).]]></summary>

such as climate, transportation, and mining. Spatio-Temporal interpolation is
highly challenging due to the complex spatial and temporal relationships.
However, traditional techniques such as Kriging suffer from high running time
and poor performance on data that exhibit high variance across space and time
dimensions. To this end, we propose a novel deep neural network called as Deep
Geospatial Interpolation Network(DGIN), which incorporates both spatial and
temporal relationships and has significantly lower training time. DGIN consists
of three major components: Spatial Encoder to capture the spatial dependencies,
Sequential module to incorporate the temporal dynamics, and an Attention block
to learn the importance of the temporal neighborhood around the gap. We
evaluate DGIN on the MODIS reflectance dataset from two different regions. Our
experimental results indicate that DGIN has two advantages: (a) it outperforms
alternative approaches (has lower MSE with p-value < 0.01) and, (b) it has
significantly low execution time than Kriging.]]></summary>

of spinal related diseases, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, degenerative cervical myelopathy and cancer. Automatic labeling of
the vertebral discs in MRI data is a difficult task because of the similarity
between discs and bone area, the variability in the geometry of the spine and
surrounding tissues across individuals, and the variability across scans
(manufacturers, pulse sequence, image contrast, resolution and artefacts). In
previous studies, vertebral disc labeling is often done after a disc detection
step and mostly fails when the localization algorithm misses discs or has false
positive detection. In this work, we aim to mitigate this problem by
reformulating the semantic vertebral disc labeling using the pose estimation
technique. To do so, we propose a stacked hourglass network with multi-level
attention mechanism to jointly learn intervertebral disc position and their
skeleton structure. The proposed deep learning model takes into account the
strength of semantic segmentation and pose estimation technique to handle the
missing area and false positive detection. To further improve the performance
of the proposed method, we propose a skeleton-based search space to reduce
false positive detection. The proposed method evaluated on spine generic public
multi-center dataset and demonstrated better performance comparing to previous
work, on both T1w and T2w contrasts. The method is implemented in ivadomed
(https://ivadomed.org).]]></summary>

non-overlapping camera views. Since person ReID data contains sensitive
personal information, researchers have adopted federated learning, an emerging
distributed training method, to mitigate the privacy leakage risks. However,
existing studies rely on data labels that are laborious and time-consuming to
obtain. We present FedUReID, a federated unsupervised person ReID system to
learn person ReID models without any labels while preserving privacy. FedUReID
enables in-situ model training on edges with unlabeled data. A cloud server
aggregates models from edges instead of centralizing raw data to preserve data
privacy. Moreover, to tackle the problem that edges vary in data volumes and
distributions, we personalize training in edges with joint optimization of
cloud and edge. Specifically, we propose personalized epoch to reassign
computation throughout training, personalized clustering to iteratively predict
suitable labels for unlabeled data, and personalized update to adapt the server
aggregated model to each edge. Extensive experiments on eight person ReID
datasets demonstrate that FedUReID not only achieves higher accuracy but also
reduces computation cost by 29%. Our FedUReID system with the joint
optimization will shed light on implementing federated learning to more
multimedia tasks without data labels.]]></summary>

with the data limitation and heterogeneity challenges in today's edge learning
arena. However, its performance is often limited by slow convergence and
corresponding low communication efficiency. Besides, since the wireless
bandwidth and IoT devices' energy capacity are usually insufficient, it is
crucial to control the resource allocation and energy consumption when
deploying FML in realistic wireless networks. To overcome these challenges, in
this paper, we first rigorously analyze each device's contribution to the
global loss reduction in each round and develop an FML algorithm (called NUFM)
with a non-uniform device selection scheme to accelerate the convergence. After
that, we formulate a resource allocation problem integrating NUFM in
multi-access wireless systems to jointly improve the convergence rate and
minimize the wall-clock time along with energy cost. By deconstructing the
original problem step by step, we devise a joint device selection and resource
allocation strategy (called URAL) to solve the problem and provide theoretical
guarantees. Further, we show that the computational complexity of NUFM can be
reduced from $O(d^2)$ to $O(d)$ (with $d$ being the model dimension) via
combining two first-order approximation techniques. Extensive simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods
by comparing with the existing baselines.]]></summary>

set of functions among which the classifier is chosen. Roughly speaking, the
more complex the family, the greater the potential disparity between the
training error and the population error of the classifier. This principle is
embodied in layman's terms by Occam's razor principle, which suggests favoring
low-complexity hypotheses over complex ones. We study a family of
low-complexity classifiers consisting of thresholding the one-dimensional
feature obtained by projecting the data on a random line after embedding it
into a higher dimensional space parametrized by monomials of order up to k.
More specifically, the extended data is projected n-times and the best
classifier among those n (based on its performance on training data) is chosen.
We obtain a bound on the generalization error of these low-complexity
classifiers. The bound is less than that of any classifier with a non-trivial
VC dimension, and thus less than that of a linear classifier. We also show
that, given full knowledge of the class conditional densities, the error of the
classifiers would converge to the optimal (Bayes) error as k and n go to
infinity; if only a training dataset is given, we show that the classifiers
will perfectly classify all the training points as k and n go to infinity.]]></summary>

in user profiles and the corresponding recommendation lists. Such behavior,
which concerns a variety of recommendation algorithms, is referred to as
popularity bias. Existing work predominantly adopts simple statistical
measures, such as the difference of mean or median popularity, to quantify
popularity bias. Moreover, it does so irrespective of user characteristics
other than the inclination to popular content. In this work, in contrast, we
propose to investigate popularity differences (between the user profile and
recommendation list) in terms of median, a variety of statistical moments, as
well as similarity measures that consider the entire popularity distributions
(Kullback-Leibler divergence and Kendall's tau rank-order correlation). This
results in a more detailed picture of the characteristics of popularity bias.
Furthermore, we investigate whether such algorithmic popularity bias affects
users of different genders in the same way. We focus on music recommendation
and conduct experiments on the recently released standardized LFM-2b dataset,
containing listening profiles of Last.fm users. We investigate the algorithmic
popularity bias of seven common recommendation algorithms (five collaborative
filtering and two baselines). Our experiments show that (1) the studied metrics
provide novel insights into popularity bias in comparison with only using
average differences, (2) algorithms less inclined towards popularity bias
amplification do not necessarily perform worse in terms of utility (NDCG), (3)
the majority of the investigated recommenders intensify the popularity bias of
the female users.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hashing technology has been widely used in image retrieval due to its
computational and storage efficiency. Recently, deep unsupervised hashing
methods have attracted increasing attention due to the high cost of human
annotations in the real world and the superiority of deep learning technology.
However, most deep unsupervised hashing methods usually pre-compute a
similarity matrix to model the pairwise relationship in the pre-trained feature
space. Then this similarity matrix would be used to guide hash learning, in
which most of the data pairs are treated equivalently. The above process is
confronted with the following defects: 1) The pre-computed similarity matrix is
inalterable and disconnected from the hash learning process, which cannot
explore the underlying semantic information. 2) The informative data pairs may
be buried by the large number of less-informative data pairs. To solve the
aforementioned problems, we propose a \textbf{Deep Self-Adaptive
Hashing~(DSAH)} model to adaptively capture the semantic information with two
special designs: \textbf{Adaptive Neighbor Discovery~(AND)} and
\textbf{Pairwise Information Content~(PIC)}. Firstly, we adopt the AND to
initially construct a neighborhood-based similarity matrix, and then refine
this initial similarity matrix with a novel update strategy to further
investigate the semantic structure behind the learned representation. Secondly,
we measure the priorities of data pairs with PIC and assign adaptive weights to
them, which is relies on the assumption that more dissimilar data pairs contain
more discriminative information for hash learning. Extensive experiments on
several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the above two technologies
facilitate the deep hashing model to achieve superior performance in a
self-adaptive manner.]]></summary>

relevance of the recommendation system. Diversity, a crucial factor which
measures the dissimilarity among the recommended items, received rather little

taken into consideration after generating the candidate items. However, this
decoupled design of diversification and candidate generation makes the whole
system suboptimal. In this paper, we aim at pushing the diversification to the
upstream candidate generation stage, with the help of Graph Convolutional
Networks (GCN). Although GCN based recommendation algorithms have shown great
power in modeling complex collaborative filtering effect to improve the
accuracy of recommendation, how diversity changes is ignored in those advanced
works. We propose to perform rebalanced neighbor discovering, category-boosted
negative sampling and adversarial learning on top of GCN. We conduct extensive

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semantic text matching is a critical problem in information retrieval.
Recently, deep learning techniques have been widely used in this area and
obtained significant performance improvements. However, most models are black
boxes and it is hard to understand what happened in the matching process, due
to the poor interpretability of deep learning. This paper aims at tackling this
problem. The key idea is to test whether existing deep text matching methods
satisfy some fundamental heuristics in information retrieval. Specifically,
four heuristics are used in our study, i.e., term frequency constraint, term
discrimination constraint, length normalization constraints, and TF-length
constraint. Since deep matching models usually contain many parameters, it is
difficult to conduct a theoretical study for these complicated functions. In
this paper, We propose an empirical testing method. Specifically, We first
construct some queries and documents to make them satisfy the assumption in a
constraint, and then test to which extend a deep text matching model trained on
the original dataset satisfies the corresponding constraint. Besides, a famous
attribution based interpretation method, namely integrated gradient, is adopted
to conduct detailed analysis and guide for feasible improvement. Experimental
results on LETOR 4.0 and MS Marco show that all the investigated deep text
matching methods, both representation and interaction based methods, satisfy
the above constraints with high probabilities in statistics. We further extend
these constraints to the semantic settings, which are shown to be better
satisfied for all the deep text matching models. These empirical findings give
clear understandings on why deep text matching models usually perform well in
information retrieval. We believe the proposed evaluation methodology will be
useful for testing future deep text matching models.]]></summary>

performance in anomaly detection for multivariate time-series data. The
de-facto solution to model the dependencies is to feed the data into a
recurrent neural network (RNN). However, the fully connected network structure
underneath the RNN (either GRU or LSTM) assumes a static and complete
dependency graph between time-series, which may not hold in many real-world
applications. To alleviate this assumption, we propose a dynamic bipartite
graph structure to encode the inter-dependencies between time-series. More
concretely, we model time series as one type of nodes, and the time series
segments (regarded as event) as another type of nodes, where the edge between
two types of nodes describe a temporal pattern occurred on a specific time
series at a certain time. Based on this design, relations between time series
can be explicitly modelled via dynamic connections to event nodes, and the
multivariate time-series anomaly detection problem can be formulated as a
self-supervised, edge stream prediction problem in dynamic graphs. We conducted
extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the design.]]></summary>

research. In the general English domain, transformer-based models have achieved
state-of-the-art performances on various NLP benchmarks. In the clinical
domain, researchers also have investigated transformer models for clinical
applications. The goal of this study is to systematically explore three widely
used transformer-based models (i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet) for clinical
relation extraction and develop an open-source package with clinical
pre-trained transformer-based models to facilitate information extraction in
the clinical domain. We developed a series of clinical RE models based on three
transformer architectures, namely BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet. We evaluated these
models using 2 publicly available datasets from 2018 MADE1.0 and 2018 n2c2
challenges. We compared two classification strategies (binary vs. multi-class
classification) and investigated two approaches to generate candidate relations
in different experimental settings. In this study, we compared three
transformer-based (BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet) models for relation extraction. We
demonstrated that the RoBERTa-clinical RE model achieved the best performance
on the 2018 MADE1.0 dataset with an F1-score of 0.8958. On the 2018 n2c2
dataset, the XLNet-clinical model achieved the best F1-score of 0.9610. Our
results indicated that the binary classification strategy consistently
outperformed the multi-class classification strategy for clinical relation
extraction. Our methods and models are publicly available at
https://github.com/uf-hobi-informatics-lab/ClinicalTransformerRelationExtraction.
We believe this work will improve current practice on clinical relation
extraction and other related NLP tasks in the biomedical domain.]]></summary>

embeddings based on time-ordered item purchasing sequences, which is defined as
Sequential Recommendation (SR) problem. Existing methods leverage sequential
patterns to model item transitions. However, most of them ignore crucial
temporal collaborative signals, which are latent in evolving user-item
interactions and coexist with sequential patterns. Therefore, we propose to
unify sequential patterns and temporal collaborative signals to improve the
quality of recommendation, which is rather challenging. Firstly, it is hard to
simultaneously encode sequential patterns and collaborative signals. Secondly,
it is non-trivial to express the temporal effects of collaborative signals.

Hence, we design a new framework Temporal Graph Sequential Recommender
(TGSRec) upon our defined continuous-time bi-partite graph. We propose a novel
Temporal Collaborative Trans-former (TCT) layer in TGSRec, which advances the
self-attention mechanism by adopting a novel collaborative attention. TCT layer
can simultaneously capture collaborative signals from both users and items, as
well as considering temporal dynamics inside sequential patterns. We propagate
the information learned fromTCTlayerover the temporal graph to unify sequential
patterns and temporal collaborative signals. Empirical results on five datasets
show that TGSRec significantly outperforms other baselines, in average up to
22.5% and 22.1%absolute improvements in Recall@10and MRR, respectively.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aiming to alleviate data sparsity and cold-start problems of traditional
recommender systems, incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) to supplement
auxiliary information has recently gained considerable attention. Via unifying
the KG with user-item interactions into a tripartite graph, recent works
explore the graph topologies to learn the low-dimensional representations of
users and items with rich semantics. However, these real-world tripartite
graphs are usually scale-free, the intrinsic hierarchical graph structures of
which are underemphasized in existing works, consequently, leading to
suboptimal recommendation performance.

To address this issue and provide more accurate recommendation, we propose a
knowledge-aware recommendation method with the hyperbolic geometry, namely
Lorentzian Knowledge-enhanced Graph convolutional networks for Recommendation
(LKGR). LKGR facilitates better modeling of scale-free tripartite graphs after
the data unification. Specifically, we employ different information propagation
strategies in the hyperbolic space to explicitly encode heterogeneous
information from historical interactions and KGs. Our proposed knowledge-aware
attention mechanism enables the model to automatically measure the information
contribution, producing the coherent information aggregation in the hyperbolic
space. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate that
LKGR outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.2-29.9% of Recall@20 on Top-K
recommendation.]]></summary>

Hierarchical tables challenge existing methods by hierarchical indexing, as

HiTab, a free and open dataset for the research community to study question
answering (QA) and natural language generation (NLG) over hierarchical tables.
HiTab is a cross-domain dataset constructed from a wealth of statistical
reports and Wikipedia pages, and has unique characteristics: (1) nearly all
tables are hierarchical, and (2) both target sentences for NLG and questions
for QA are revised from high-quality descriptions in statistical reports that
are meaningful and diverse. (3) HiTab provides fine-grained annotations on both
entity and quantity alignment. Targeting hierarchical structure, we devise a
novel hierarchy-aware logical form for symbolic reasoning over tables, which
shows high effectiveness. Then given annotations of entity and quantity
alignment, we propose partially supervised training, which helps models to
largely reduce spurious predictions in the QA task. In the NLG task, we find
that entity and quantity alignment also helps NLG models to generate better

behavior in order to predict future interactions in sequential user data. At
their core, such approaches model transition probabilities between items in a
sequence, whether through Markov chains, recurrent networks, or more recently,
Transformers. However both old and new issues remain, including data-sparsity
and noisy data; such issues can impair the performance, especially in complex,
parameter-hungry models. In this paper, we investigate the application of
contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to the sequential recommendation, as
a way to alleviate some of these issues. Contrastive SSL constructs
augmentations from unlabelled instances, where agreements among positive pairs
are maximized. It is challenging to devise a contrastive SSL framework for a
sequential recommendation, due to its discrete nature, correlations among
items, and skewness of length distributions. To this end, we propose a novel
framework, Contrastive Self-supervised Learning for sequential Recommendation
(CoSeRec). We introduce two informative augmentation operators leveraging item
correlations to create high-quality views for contrastive learning.
Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method on improving model performance and the robustness
against sparse and noisy data. Our implementation is available online at

rule and knowledge-based reasoning is used to obtain a holistic overview. This
offers a strategic decision support from business structure over process design
up to planning the appropriate support technology. Therefore, it forms the base
for organisations to act in an agile way. The modelling can be performed in
different modelling languages, including ArchiMate and the Nato Architecture
Framework (NAF). The designed approach is already evaluated on a small company
with multiple services and an infrastructure with several nodes.]]></summary>

videos from a multi-antenna base station (BS) to one or multiple single-antenna
users, respectively, in a multi-carrier wireless system. We aim to maximize the
video quality while keeping rebuffering time small via encoding rate adaptation
at each group of pictures (GOP) and transmission adaptation at each
(transmission) slot. To capture the impact of field-of-view (FoV) prediction,
we consider three cases of FoV viewing probability distributions, i.e.,
perfect, imperfect, and unknown FoV viewing probability distributions, and use
the average total utility, worst average total utility, and worst total utility
as the respective performance metrics. In the single-user scenario, we optimize
the encoding rates of the tiles, encoding rates of the FoVs, and transmission
beamforming vectors for all subcarriers to maximize the total utility in each
case. In the multi-user scenario, we adopt rate splitting with successive
decoding and optimize the encoding rates of the tiles, encoding rates of the
FoVs, rates of the common and private messages, and transmission beamforming
vectors for all subcarriers to maximize the total utility in each case. Then,
we separate the challenging optimization problem into multiple tractable
problems in each scenario. In the single-user scenario, we obtain a globally
optimal solution of each problem using transformation techniques and the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. In the multi-user scenario, we obtain a
KKT point of each problem using the concave-convex procedure (CCCP). Finally,
numerical results demonstrate that the proposed solutions achieve notable gains
over existing schemes in all three cases. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work revealing the impact of FoV prediction on the performance of
adaptive streaming of tiled 360 videos.]]></summary>

few-shot text classification. Instead of computing the likelihood of the label
given the input (referred as direct models), channel models compute the
conditional probability of the input given the label, and are thereby required
to explain every word in the input. We use channel models for recently proposed
few-shot learning methods with no or very limited updates to the language model
parameters, via either in-context demonstration or prompt tuning. Our
experiments show that, for both methods, channel models significantly
outperform their direct counterparts, which we attribute to their stability,
i.e., lower variance and higher worst-case accuracy. We also present extensive
ablations that provide recommendations for when to use channel prompt tuning
instead of other competitive models (e.g., direct head tuning): channel prompt
tuning is preferred when the number of training examples is small, labels in
the training data are imbalanced, or generalization to unseen labels is
required.]]></summary>

research. In the general English domain, transformer-based models have achieved
state-of-the-art performances on various NLP benchmarks. In the clinical
domain, researchers also have investigated transformer models for clinical
applications. The goal of this study is to systematically explore three widely
used transformer-based models (i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet) for clinical
relation extraction and develop an open-source package with clinical
pre-trained transformer-based models to facilitate information extraction in
the clinical domain. We developed a series of clinical RE models based on three
transformer architectures, namely BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet. We evaluated these
models using 2 publicly available datasets from 2018 MADE1.0 and 2018 n2c2
challenges. We compared two classification strategies (binary vs. multi-class
classification) and investigated two approaches to generate candidate relations
in different experimental settings. In this study, we compared three
transformer-based (BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet) models for relation extraction. We
demonstrated that the RoBERTa-clinical RE model achieved the best performance
on the 2018 MADE1.0 dataset with an F1-score of 0.8958. On the 2018 n2c2
dataset, the XLNet-clinical model achieved the best F1-score of 0.9610. Our
results indicated that the binary classification strategy consistently
outperformed the multi-class classification strategy for clinical relation
extraction. Our methods and models are publicly available at
https://github.com/uf-hobi-informatics-lab/ClinicalTransformerRelationExtraction.
We believe this work will improve current practice on clinical relation
extraction and other related NLP tasks in the biomedical domain.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large language models have led to state-of-the-art accuracies across a range
of tasks. However, training these models efficiently is challenging for two
reasons: a) GPU memory capacity is limited, making it impossible to fit large
models on even a multi-GPU server, and b) the number of compute operations
required to train these models can result in unrealistically long training
times. Consequently, new methods of model parallelism such as tensor and
pipeline parallelism have been proposed. Unfortunately, naive usage of these
methods leads to fundamental scaling issues at thousands of GPUs, e.g., due to
expensive cross-node communication or devices spending significant time waiting
on other devices to make progress.

In this paper, we show how different types of parallelism methods (tensor,
pipeline, and data parallelism) can be composed to scale to thousands of GPUs
and models with trillions of parameters. We survey techniques for pipeline
parallelism and propose a novel interleaved pipeline parallelism schedule that
can improve throughput by 10+% with memory footprint comparable to existing
approaches. We quantitatively study the trade-offs between tensor, pipeline,
and data parallelism, and provide intuition as to how to configure distributed
training of a large model. Our approach allows us to perform training
iterations on a model with 1 trillion parameters at 502 petaFLOP/s on 3072 GPUs
with achieved per-GPU throughput of 52% of theoretical peak. Our code is open

automatically colored, such as video sites and archives. In this paper, we
present the HistoryNet focusing on historical person's diverse high fidelity
clothing colorization based on fine grained semantic understanding and prior.
Colorization of historical persons is realistic and practical, however,
existing methods do not perform well in the regards. In this paper, a
HistoryNet including three parts, namely, classification, fine grained semantic
parsing and colorization, is proposed. Classification sub-module supplies
classifying of images according to the eras, nationalities and garment types;
Parsing sub-network supplies the semantic for person contours, clothing and
background in the image to achieve more accurate colorization of clothes and
persons and prevent color overflow. In the training process, we integrate
classification and semantic parsing features into the coloring generation
network to improve colorization. Through the design of classification and
parsing subnetwork, the accuracy of image colorization can be improved and the

transfer learning to exploit their commonality. The adversarial neural transfer
(ANT) framework utilizes multiple loss terms that encourage the source-domain

which can lead to optimization difficulties and sometimes diminished transfer.
We propose a generalized latent optimization strategy that allows different

have developed various customized BERT models with improved performance for
specific domains and tasks by exploiting the benefits of {\em transfer
learning}. Due to the nature of mathematical texts, which often use domain
specific vocabulary along with equations and math symbols, we posit that the
development of a new BERT model for mathematics would be useful for many
mathematical downstream tasks. In this resource paper, we introduce our
multi-institutional effort (i.e., two learning platforms and three academic
institutions in the US) toward this need: MathBERT, a model created by
pre-training the BASE BERT model on a large mathematical corpus ranging from
pre-kindergarten (pre-k), to high-school, to college graduate level
mathematical content. In addition, we select three general NLP tasks that are
often used in mathematics education: prediction of knowledge component,
auto-grading open-ended Q\&A, and knowledge tracing, to demonstrate the
superiority of MathBERT over BASE BERT. Our experiments show that MathBERT
outperforms prior best methods by 1.2-22\% and BASE BERT by 2-8\% on these
tasks. In addition, we build a mathematics specific vocabulary `mathVocab' to
train with MathBERT. We discover that MathBERT pre-trained with `mathVocab'
outperforms MathBERT trained with the BASE BERT vocabulary (i.e., `origVocab').
MathBERT is currently being adopted at the participated leaning platforms:
Stride, Inc, a commercial educational resource provider, and ASSISTments.org, a
free online educational platform. We release MathBERT for public usage at:

network-based de-identification sys-tems with and without domain
generalization. We used two domain generalization approaches: a novel approach
Joint-Domain Learning (JDL) as developed in this paper, and a state-of-the-art
domain general-ization approach Common-Specific Decomposition (CSD) from the
literature. First, we measured trans-ferability from a single external source.
Second, we used two external sources and evaluated whether domain
generalization can improve transferability of de-identification models across
domains which rep-resent different note types from the same institution. Third,
using two external sources with in-domain training data, we studied whether
external source data are useful even in cases where sufficient in-domain
training data are available. Finally, we investigated transferability of the
de-identification mod-els across institutions. Results and Conclusions: We
found transferability from a single external source gave inconsistent re-sults.
Using additional external sources consistently yielded an F1-score of
approximately 80%, but domain generalization was not always helpful to improve
transferability. We also found that external sources were useful even in cases
where in-domain training data were available by reducing the amount of needed
in-domain training data or by improving performance. Transferability across
institutions was differed by note type and annotation label. External sources
from a different institution were also useful to further improve performance.]]></summary>

capabilities, including zero and few-shot translation between low-resource
language pairs. However, these models are often evaluated on high-resource
languages with the assumption that they generalize to low-resource ones. The
difficulty of evaluating MT models on low-resource pairs is often due to lack
of standardized evaluation datasets. In this paper, we present MENYO-20k, the
first multi-domain parallel corpus with a special focus on clean orthography
for Yor\`ub\'a--English with standardized train-test splits for benchmarking.
We provide several neural MT benchmarks and compare them to the performance of
popular pre-trained (massively multilingual) MT models both for the
heterogeneous test set and its subdomains. Since these pre-trained models use
huge amounts of data with uncertain quality, we also analyze the effect of
diacritics, a major characteristic of Yor\`ub\'a, in the training data. We
investigate how and when this training condition affects the final quality and
intelligibility of a translation. Our models outperform massively multilingual
models such as Google ($+8.7$ BLEU) and Facebook M2M ($+9.1$ BLEU) when
translating to Yor\`ub\'a, setting a high quality benchmark for future

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The mainstream image captioning models rely on Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) image features to generate captions via recurrent models. Recently, image
scene graphs have been used to augment captioning models so as to leverage
their structural semantics, such as object entities, relationships and
attributes. Several studies have noted that the naive use of scene graphs from
a black-box scene graph generator harms image captioning performance and that
scene graph-based captioning models have to incur the overhead of explicit use
of image features to generate decent captions. Addressing these challenges, we
propose \textbf{SG2Caps}, a framework that utilizes only the scene graph labels
for competitive image captioning performance. The basic idea is to close the
semantic gap between the two scene graphs - one derived from the input image
and the other from its caption. In order to achieve this, we leverage the
spatial location of objects and the Human-Object-Interaction (HOI) labels as an
additional HOI graph. SG2Caps outperforms existing scene graph-only captioning
models by a large margin, indicating scene graphs as a promising representation
for image captioning. Direct utilization of scene graph labels avoids expensive
graph convolutions over high-dimensional CNN features resulting in 49% fewer
trainable parameters. Our code is available at:

(or moment) semantically relevant to a language query. The solution to this
challenging task demands understanding videos' and queries' semantic content

idea is to recast this challenge into an algorithmic graph matching problem.
Fueled by recent advances in Graph Neural Networks, we propose to leverage
Graph Convolutional Networks to model video and textual information as well as
their semantic alignment. To enable the mutual exchange of information across
the modalities, we design a novel Video-Language Graph Matching Network
(VLG-Net) to match video and query graphs. Core ingredients include
representation graphs built atop video snippets and query tokens separately and
used to model intra-modality relationships. A Graph Matching layer is adopted
for cross-modal context modeling and multi-modal fusion. Finally, moment
candidates are created using masked moment attention pooling by fusing the
moment's enriched snippet features. We demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art grounding methods on three widely used datasets for temporal
localization of moments in videos with language queries: ActivityNet-Captions,
TACoS, and DiDeMo.]]></summary>

formulate the quest of vocabularization -- finding the best token dictionary
with a proper size -- as an optimal transport (OT) problem. We propose VOLT, a
simple and efficient solution without trial training. Empirical results show
that VOLT outperforms widely-used vocabularies in diverse scenarios, including
WMT-14 English-German and TED's 52 translation directions. For example, VOLT
achieves almost 70% vocabulary size reduction and 0.5 BLEU gain on
English-German translation. Also, compared to BPE-search, VOLT reduces the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vision-and-language pretraining (VLP) aims to learn generic multimodal
representations from massive image-text pairs. While various successful
attempts have been proposed, learning fine-grained semantic alignments between
image-text pairs plays a key role in their approaches. Nevertheless, most
existing VLP approaches have not fully utilized the intrinsic knowledge within
the image-text pairs, which limits the effectiveness of the learned alignments
and further restricts the performance of their models. To this end, we
introduce a new VLP method called ROSITA, which integrates the cross- and
intra-modal knowledge in a unified scene graph to enhance the semantic
alignments. Specifically, we introduce a novel structural knowledge masking
(SKM) strategy to use the scene graph structure as a priori to perform masked
language (region) modeling, which enhances the semantic alignments by
eliminating the interference information within and across modalities.
Extensive ablation studies and comprehensive analysis verifies the
effectiveness of ROSITA in semantic alignments. Pretrained with both in-domain
and out-of-domain datasets, ROSITA significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art VLP methods on three typical vision-and-language tasks over
six benchmark datasets.]]></summary>

information to understand and interpret music communication. Conventional
natural language processing approaches use translation of the Hindi text into
English for analysis. This approach is not suitable for lyrics as it is likely
to lose the inherent intended contextual meaning. Thus, the need was identified
to develop a system for Devanagari text analysis. The data set of 300 song
lyrics with equal distribution in five different moods is used for the
experimentation. The proposed system performs contextual mood analysis of Hindi
song lyrics in Devanagari text format. The contextual analysis is stored as a
knowledge base, updated using an incremental learning approach with new data.
Contextual knowledge graph with moods and associated important contextual terms
provides the graphical representation of the lyric data set used. The testing
results show 64% accuracy for the mood prediction. This work can be easily
extended to applications related to Hindi literary work such as summarization,
indexing, contextual retrieval, context-based classification and grouping of

sequence labeling by explicitly (and only) copying labels from retrieved

impressive performance in zero-shot sequence-labeling tasks. We additionally
consider a dynamic programming approach to sequence labeling in the presence of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We propose a novel interpretable deep neural network for text classification,
called ProtoryNet, based on a new concept of prototype trajectories. Motivated
by the prototype theory in modern linguistics, ProtoryNet makes a prediction by
finding the most similar prototype for each sentence in a text sequence and
feeding an RNN backbone with the proximity of each sentence to the
corresponding active prototype. The RNN backbone then captures the temporal
pattern of the prototypes, which we refer to as prototype trajectories.
Prototype trajectories enable intuitive and fine-grained interpretation of the
reasoning process of the RNN model, in resemblance to how humans analyze texts.
We also design a prototype pruning procedure to reduce the total number of
prototypes used by the model for better interpretability. Experiments on
multiple public data sets show that ProtoryNet is more accurate than the
baseline prototype-based deep neural net and reduces the performance gap
compared to state-of-the-art black-box models. In addition, after prototype
pruning, the resulting ProtoryNet models only need less than or around 20
prototypes for all datasets, which significantly benefits interpretability.
Furthermore, we report a survey result indicating that human users find
ProtoryNet more intuitive and easier to understand than other prototype-based
methods.]]></summary>

approach that optimizes coherence of the text locally with the random sampling
approach that increases coverage of the text globally. Our results show that
the random sampling approach performs better. When training on a seed corpus of

a simulated low resource language, and +4.9 BLEU using Eastern Pokomchi, a

translation models with increasing amount of human post-edited data through

dialogue system, expects a shorter inference latency due to the impatience of
humans. Non-autoregressive SLU models clearly increase the inference speed but
suffer uncoordinated-slot problems caused by the lack of sequential dependency
information among each slot chunk. To gap this shortcoming, in this paper, we
propose a novel non-autoregressive SLU model named Layered-Refine Transformer,
which contains a Slot Label Generation (SLG) task and a Layered Refine
Mechanism (LRM). SLG is defined as generating the next slot label with the
token sequence and generated slot labels. With SLG, the non-autoregressive
model can efficiently obtain dependency information during training and spend
no extra time in inference. LRM predicts the preliminary SLU results from
Transformer's middle states and utilizes them to guide the final prediction.
Experiments on two public datasets indicate that our model significantly
improves SLU performance (1.5\% on Overall accuracy) while substantially speed
up (more than 10 times) the inference process over the state-of-the-art
baseline.]]></summary>

Hierarchical tables challenge existing methods by hierarchical indexing, as
well as implicit relationships of calculation and semantics. This work presents
HiTab, a free and open dataset for the research community to study question
answering (QA) and natural language generation (NLG) over hierarchical tables.
HiTab is a cross-domain dataset constructed from a wealth of statistical
reports and Wikipedia pages, and has unique characteristics: (1) nearly all
tables are hierarchical, and (2) both target sentences for NLG and questions
for QA are revised from high-quality descriptions in statistical reports that
are meaningful and diverse. (3) HiTab provides fine-grained annotations on both
entity and quantity alignment. Targeting hierarchical structure, we devise a
novel hierarchy-aware logical form for symbolic reasoning over tables, which
shows high effectiveness. Then given annotations of entity and quantity
alignment, we propose partially supervised training, which helps models to
largely reduce spurious predictions in the QA task. In the NLG task, we find
that entity and quantity alignment also helps NLG models to generate better
results in a conditional generation setting. Experiment results of
state-of-the-art baselines suggest that this dataset presents a strong
challenge and a valuable benchmark for future research.]]></summary>

can bring multiple benefits to speller and other search components, which is
particularly true for the most commonly deployed noisy-channel based speller

contextual representation learning such as BERTology, building a decent
misspelling detector without having to rely on hand-crafted features associated
with noisy-channel architecture becomes more-than-ever accessible. However
BERTolgy models are trained with natural language corpus but Maps Search is
highly domain specific, would BERTology continue its success. In this paper we
design 4 stages of models for misspeling detection ranging from the most basic
LSTM to single-domain augmented fine-tuned BERT. We found for Maps Search in
our case, other advanced BERTology family model such as RoBERTa does not
necessarily outperform BERT, and a classic cross-domain fine-tuned full BERT
even underperforms a smaller single-domain fine-tuned BERT. We share more

well-written sources. However, in intelligent voice assistants, where NER is an
important component, input to NER may be noisy because of user or speech
recognition error. In applications, entity labels may change frequently, and
non-textual properties like topicality or popularity may be needed to choose
among alternatives.

We describe a NER system intended to address these problems. We test and
train this system on a proprietary user-derived dataset. We compare with a
baseline text-only NER system; the baseline enhanced with external gazetteers;
and the baseline enhanced with the search and indirect labelling techniques we
describe below. The final configuration gives around 6% reduction in NER error
rate. We also show that this technique improves related tasks, such as semantic

knowledge base (KB). Early studies mainly focused on answering simple questions
over KBs and achieved great success. However, their performance on complex

researchers propose a large number of novel methods, which looked into the
challenges of answering complex questions. In this survey, we review recent
advances on KBQA with the focus on solving complex questions, which usually
contain multiple subjects, express compound relations, or involve numerical
operations. In detail, we begin with introducing the complex KBQA task and
relevant background. Then, we describe benchmark datasets for complex KBQA task
and introduce the construction process of these datasets. Next, we present two
mainstream categories of methods for complex KBQA, namely semantic
parsing-based (SP-based) methods and information retrieval-based (IR-based)
methods. Specifically, we illustrate their procedures with flow designs and
discuss their major differences and similarities. After that, we summarize the
challenges that these two categories of methods encounter when answering
complex questions, and explicate advanced solutions and techniques used in
existing work. Finally, we conclude and discuss several promising directions

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Public security vulnerability reports (e.g., CVE reports) play an important
role in the maintenance of computer and network systems. Security companies and
administrators rely on information from these reports to prioritize tasks on
developing and deploying patches to their customers. Since these reports are
unstructured texts, automatic information extraction (IE) can help scale up the
processing by converting the unstructured reports to structured forms, e.g.,
software names and versions and vulnerability types. Existing works on
automated IE for security vulnerability reports often rely on a large number of
labeled training samples. However, creating massive labeled training set is
both expensive and time consuming. In this work, for the first time, we propose
to investigate this problem where only a small number of labeled training
samples are available. In particular, we investigate the performance of
fine-tuning several state-of-the-art pre-trained language models on our small
training dataset. The results show that with pre-trained language models and
carefully tuned hyperparameters, we have reached or slightly outperformed the
state-of-the-art system on this task. Consistent with previous two-step process
of first fine-tuning on main category and then transfer learning to others as
in [7], if otherwise following our proposed approach, the number of required
labeled samples substantially decrease in both stages: 90% reduction in
fine-tuning from 5758 to 576,and 88.8% reduction in transfer learning with 64
labeled samples per category. Our experiments thus demonstrate the
effectiveness of few-sample learning on NER for security vulnerability report.
This result opens up multiple research opportunities for few-sample learning
for security vulnerability reports, which is discussed in the paper. Code:

engagement on these platforms via comments and reactions. A large portion of
such textual comments are abusive, rude and offensive to the audience. With
machine learning systems in-place to check such comments coming onto platform,
biases present in the training data gets passed onto the classifier leading to
discrimination against a set of classes, religion and gender. In this work, we
evaluate different classifiers and feature to estimate the bias in these
classifiers along with their performance on downstream task of toxicity
classification. Results show that improvement in performance of automatic toxic
comment detection models is positively correlated to mitigating biases in these
models. In our work, LSTM with attention mechanism proved to be a better
modelling strategy than a CNN model. Further analysis shows that fasttext
embeddings is marginally preferable than glove embeddings on training models
for toxicity comment detection. Deeper analysis reveals the findings that such
automatic models are particularly biased to specific identity groups even
though the model has a high AUC score. Finally, in effort to mitigate bias in
toxicity detection models, a multi-task setup trained with auxiliary task of
toxicity sub-types proved to be useful leading to upto 0.26% (6% relative) gain
in AUC scores.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lifespan face synthesis (LFS) model aims to generate a set of
photo-realistic face images of a person's whole life, given only one snapshot
as reference. The generated face image given a target age code is expected to
be age-sensitive reflected by bio-plausible transformations of shape and
texture, while being identity preserving. This is extremely challenging because
the shape and texture characteristics of a face undergo separate and highly
nonlinear transformations w.r.t. age. Most recent LFS models are based on
generative adversarial networks (GANs) whereby age code conditional
transformations are applied to a latent face representation. They benefit
greatly from the recent advancements of GANs. However, without explicitly
disentangling their latent representations into the texture, shape and identity
factors, they are fundamentally limited in modeling the nonlinear age-related
transformation on texture and shape whilst preserving identity. In this work, a
novel LFS model is proposed to disentangle the key face characteristics
including shape, texture and identity so that the unique shape and texture age
transformations can be modeled effectively. This is achieved by extracting
shape, texture and identity features separately from an encoder. Critically,
two transformation modules, one conditional convolution based and the other
channel attention based, are designed for modeling the nonlinear shape and
texture feature transformations respectively. This is to accommodate their
rather distinct aging processes and ensure that our synthesized images are both
age-sensitive and identity preserving. Extensive experiments show that our LFS
model is clearly superior to the state-of-the-art alternatives. Codes and demo
are available on our project website:

segments (interictal). To find these waveforms we apply a shift-invariant
k-means algorithm to segments of spatially filtered signals to learn codebooks
of prototypical waveforms. The frequency of the cluster labels from the
codebooks is then used to train a binary classifier that predicts the class
(preictal or interictal) of a test ECoG segment. We use the Matthews
correlation coefficient to evaluate the performance of the classifier and the

non-sinusoidal waveforms that could be used to build interpretable features for

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intelligent recommendation and reminder systems are the need of the
fast-pacing life. Current intelligent systems such as Siri, Google Assistant,
Microsoft Cortona, etc., have limited capability. For example, if you want to
wake up at 6 am because you have an upcoming trip, you have to set the alarm
manually. Besides, these systems do not recommend or remind what else to carry,
such as carrying an umbrella during a likely rain. The present work proposes a
system that takes an email as input and returns a recommendation-cumreminder
list. As a first step, we parse the emails, recognize the entities using named
entity recognition (NER). In the second step, information retrieval over the
web is done to identify nearby places, climatic conditions, etc. Imperative
sentences from the reviews of all places are extracted and passed to the object
extraction module. The main challenge lies in extracting the objects (items) of
interest from the review. To solve it, a modified Machine Reading
Comprehension-NER (MRC-NER) model is trained to tag objects of interest by
formulating annotation rules as a query. The objects so found are recommended
to the user one day in advance. The final reminder list of objects is pruned by
our proposed model for tracking objects kept during the "packing activity."
Eventually, when the user leaves for the event/trip, an alert is sent
containing the reminding list items. Our approach achieves superior performance
compared to several baselines by as much as 30% on recall and 10% on precision.]]></summary>

spatial-temporal dependencies in computer vision tasks. Although having shown
excellent performance, they still lack the mechanism to encode the rich,

theoretically analyze the property of these nonlocal-based blocks, we provide a
new perspective to interpret them, where we view them as a set of graph filters
generated on a fully-connected graph. Specifically, when choosing the Chebyshev
graph filter, a unified formulation can be derived for explaining and analyzing
the existing nonlocal-based blocks (e.g., nonlocal block, nonlocal stage,
double attention block). Furthermore, by concerning the property of spectral,
we propose an efficient and robust spectral nonlocal block, which can be more
robust and flexible to catch long-range dependencies when inserted into deep
neural networks than the existing nonlocal blocks. Experimental results
demonstrate the clear-cut improvements and practical applicabilities of our
method on image classification, action recognition, semantic segmentation, and

capture more comprehensive similarity relations, we propose a novel approach
that leverages both query-centric and PAssage-centric sImilarity Relations

three major technical contributions by introducing formal formulations of the
two kinds of similarity relations, generating high-quality pseudo labeled data

procedure that incorporates passage-centric similarity relation constraint.
Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms previous

given rise to synthetic causal reasoning video datasets. These datasets
facilitate the development of AI algorithms that can reason about physical

on elementary physical events such as rolling or falling. There is currently a
scarcity of datasets that focus on the physical interactions that humans
perform daily with objects in the real world. To address this scarcity, we
introduce SPACE: A Simulator for Physical Interactions and Causal Learning in
3D Environments. The SPACE simulator allows us to generate the SPACE dataset, a
synthetic video dataset in a 3D environment, to systematically evaluate
physics-based models on a range of physical causal reasoning tasks. Inspired by
daily object interactions, the SPACE dataset comprises videos depicting three
types of physical events: containment, stability and contact. These events make
up the vast majority of the basic physical interactions between objects. We
then further evaluate it with a state-of-the-art physics-based deep model and
show that the SPACE dataset improves the learning of intuitive physics with an
approach inspired by curriculum learning. Repository:

that it is possible to radically simplify these models so long as the feature
extraction layer is retained with minimal degradation to model performance;
further, we discover that it is possible to improve performance overall on
ModelNet40 and S3DIS by improving the design of the feature extractor. Our
approach reduces memory consumption by 20$\times$ and latency by up to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weakly-supervised learning (WSL) has recently triggered substantial interest
as it mitigates the lack of pixel-wise annotations.

Given global image labels, WSL methods yield pixel-level predictions
(segmentations), which enable to interpret class predictions. Despite their
recent success, mostly with natural images, such methods can face important
challenges when the foreground and background regions have similar visual cues,
yielding high false-positive rates in segmentations, as is the case in
challenging histology images. WSL training is commonly driven by standard
classification losses, which implicitly maximize model confidence, and locate
the discriminative regions linked to classification decisions. Therefore, they
lack mechanisms for modeling explicitly non-discriminative regions and reducing
false-positive rates. We propose novel regularization terms, which enable the
model to seek both non-discriminative and discriminative regions, while
discouraging unbalanced segmentations. We introduce high uncertainty as a
criterion to localize non-discriminative regions that do not affect classifier
decision, and describe it with original Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence losses
evaluating the deviation of posterior predictions from the uniform
distribution. Our KL terms encourage high uncertainty of the model when the
latter inputs the latent non-discriminative regions. Our loss integrates: (i) a
cross-entropy seeking a foreground, where model confidence about class
prediction is high; (ii) a KL regularizer seeking a background, where model
uncertainty is high; and (iii) log-barrier terms discouraging unbalanced
segmentations. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies over the public
GlaS colon cancer data and a Camelyon16 patch-based benchmark for breast cancer
show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art WSL methods, and confirm
the effect of our new regularizers.]]></summary>

bloodstream to image the vascular structure of the retina. The injected dye can
cause adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, anaphylactic shock, and even
death. In contrast, color fundus imaging is a non-invasive technique used for
photographing the retina but does not have sufficient fidelity for capturing
its vascular structure. The only non-invasive method for capturing retinal
vasculature is optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCTA). However, OCTA
equipment is quite expensive, and stable imaging is limited to small areas on
the retina. In this paper, we propose a novel conditional generative
adversarial network (GAN) capable of simultaneously synthesizing FA images from
fundus photographs while predicting retinal degeneration. The proposed system
has the benefit of addressing the problem of imaging retinal vasculature in a
non-invasive manner as well as predicting the existence of retinal
abnormalities. We use a semi-supervised approach to train our GAN using
multiple weighted losses on different modalities of data. Our experiments
validate that the proposed architecture exceeds recent state-of-the-art
generative networks for fundus-to-angiography synthesis. Moreover, our vision
transformer-based discriminators generalize quite well on out-of-distribution
data sets for retinal disease prediction.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Domain adaptation for semantic segmentation enables to alleviate the need for
large-scale pixel-wise annotations. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL)
with a combination of image-to-image translation shows great effectiveness in
adaptive segmentation. The most common practice is to perform SSL along with
image translation to well align a single domain (the source or target).
However, in this single-domain paradigm, unavoidable visual inconsistency
raised by image translation may affect subsequent learning. In this paper,
based on the observation that domain adaptation frameworks performed in the
source and target domain are almost complementary in terms of image translation
and SSL, we propose a novel dual path learning (DPL) framework to alleviate
visual inconsistency. Concretely, DPL contains two complementary and
interactive single-domain adaptation pipelines aligned in source and target
domain respectively. The inference of DPL is extremely simple, only one
segmentation model in the target domain is employed. Novel technologies such as
dual path image translation and dual path adaptive segmentation are proposed to
make two paths promote each other in an interactive manner. Experiments on
GTA5$\rightarrow$Cityscapes and SYNTHIA$\rightarrow$Cityscapes scenarios
demonstrate the superiority of our DPL model over the state-of-the-art methods.

successfully. (ii) Both large-scale pre-trained models and adversarial training
methods achieve far worse performance on the new benchmark than over standard
VQA v2 dataset, revealing the fragility of these models while demonstrating the
effectiveness of our adversarial dataset. (iii) When used for data

on robustness study in the community and serve as a valuable benchmark for

novel view synthesis of complex scenes. In our approach, a 3D scene is
represented as a light field, i.e., a set of rays, each of which has a
corresponding color when reaching the image plane. For efficient novel view
rendering, we adopt a 4D parameterization of the light field, where each ray is
characterized by a 4D parameter. We then formulate the light field as a 4D
function that maps 4D coordinates to corresponding color values. We train a
deep fully connected network to optimize this implicit function and memorize
the 3D scene. Then, the scene-specific model is used to synthesize novel views.
Different from previous light field approaches which require dense view
sampling to reliably render novel views, our method can render novel views by
sampling rays and querying the color for each ray from the network directly,
thus enabling high-quality light field rendering with a sparser set of training
images. Our method achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis results while
maintaining an interactive frame rate.]]></summary>

considering its advantage of low cost. It is much more challenging than
conventional 2D cases due to its inherent ill-posed property, which is mainly
reflected in the lack of depth information. Recent progress on 2D detection
offers opportunities to better solving this problem. However, it is non-trivial
to make a general adapted 2D detector work in this 3D task. In this paper, we
study this problem with a practice built on a fully convolutional single-stage
detector and propose a general framework FCOS3D. Specifically, we first
transform the commonly defined 7-DoF 3D targets to the image domain and
decouple them as 2D and 3D attributes. Then the objects are distributed to
different feature levels with consideration of their 2D scales and assigned
only according to the projected 3D-center for the training procedure.
Furthermore, the center-ness is redefined with a 2D Gaussian distribution based
on the 3D-center to fit the 3D target formulation. All of these make this
framework simple yet effective, getting rid of any 2D detection or 2D-3D
correspondence priors. Our solution achieves 1st place out of all the
vision-only methods in the nuScenes 3D detection challenge of NeurIPS 2020.

time was reduced to 0.52 GPU day. This is a huge and significant achievement
compared to the NAS of 4 GPU days achieved using NSGA-Net, 3,150 GPU days by
the AmoebaNet model, and the 2,000 GPU days by the NASNet model. As well, Early
Exit Evolutionary Algorithm networks (EEEA-Nets) yield network architectures
with minimal error and computational cost suitable for a given dataset as a
class of network algorithms. Using EEEA-Net on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
ImageNet datasets, our experiments showed that EEEA-Net achieved the lowest
error rate among state-of-the-art NAS models, with 2.46% for CIFAR-10, 15.02%
for CIFAR-100, and 23.8% for ImageNet dataset. Further, we implemented this
image recognition architecture for other tasks, such as object detection,
semantic segmentation, and keypoint detection tasks, and, in our experiments,
EEEA-Net-C2 outperformed MobileNet-V3 on all of these various tasks. (The

their advancements in computer vision, along with their unprecedented size and
amounts of training data, many have come to believe that they are not suitable
for small sets of data. This trend leads to great concerns, including but not
limited to: limited availability of data in certain scientific domains and the
exclusion of those with limited resource from research in the field. In this
paper, we dispel the myth that transformers are "data hungry" and therefore can
only be applied to large sets of data. We show for the first time that with the
right size and tokenization, transformers can perform head-to-head with
state-of-the-art CNNs on small datasets, often with better accuracy and fewer
parameters. Our model eliminates the requirement for class token and positional
embeddings through a novel sequence pooling strategy and the use of
convolution/s. It is flexible in terms of model size, and can have as little as
0.28M parameters while achieving good results. Our model can reach 98.00%
accuracy when training from scratch on CIFAR-10, which is a significant
improvement over previous Transformer based models. It also outperforms many
modern CNN based approaches, such as ResNet, and even some recent NAS-based
approaches, such as Proxyless-NAS. Our simple and compact design democratizes
transformers by making them accessible to those with limited computing
resources and/or dealing with small datasets. Our method also works on larger
datasets, such as ImageNet (82.71% accuracy with 29% parameters of ViT), and
NLP tasks as well. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at

Transferring to image classification leads to 78.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Probabilistic point cloud registration methods are becoming more popular
because of their robustness. However, unlike point-to-plane variants of
iterative closest point (ICP) which incorporate local surface geometric
information such as surface normals, most probabilistic methods (e.g., coherent
point drift (CPD)) ignore such information and build Gaussian mixture models
(GMMs) with isotropic Gaussian covariances. This results in sphere-like GMM
components which only penalize the point-to-point distance between the two
point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel method called CPD with Local
Surface Geometry (LSG-CPD) for rigid point cloud registration. Our method
adaptively adds different levels of point-to-plane penalization on top of the
point-to-point penalization based on the flatness of the local surface. This
results in GMM components with anisotropic covariances. We formulate point
cloud registration as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem and solve
it with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. In the E step, we
demonstrate that the computation can be recast into simple matrix manipulations
and efficiently computed on a GPU. In the M step, we perform an unconstrained
optimization on a matrix Lie group to efficiently update the rigid
transformation of the registration. The proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness on various
datasets captured with range scanners, RGBD cameras, and LiDARs. Also, it is
significantly faster than modern implementations of CPD. The source code is
available at https://github.com/ChirikjianLab/LSG-CPD.git.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables a learning machine to adapt from
a labeled source domain to an unlabeled domain under the distribution shift.
Thanks to the strong representation ability of deep neural networks, recent
remarkable achievements in UDA resort to learning domain-invariant features.
Intuitively, the hope is that a good feature representation, together with the
hypothesis learned from the source domain, can generalize well to the target
domain. However, the learning processes of domain-invariant features and source
hypothesis inevitably involve domain-specific information that would degrade
the generalizability of UDA models on the target domain. In this paper,
motivated by the lottery ticket hypothesis that only partial parameters are
essential for generalization, we find that only partial parameters are
essential for learning domain-invariant information and generalizing well in
UDA. Such parameters are termed transferable parameters. In contrast, the other
parameters tend to fit domain-specific details and often fail to generalize,
which we term as untransferable parameters. Driven by this insight, we propose
Transferable Parameter Learning (TransPar) to reduce the side effect brought by
domain-specific information in the learning process and thus enhance the
memorization of domain-invariant information. Specifically, according to the
distribution discrepancy degree, we divide all parameters into transferable and
untransferable ones in each training iteration. We then perform separate
updates rules for the two types of parameters. Extensive experiments on image
classification and regression tasks (keypoint detection) show that TransPar
outperforms prior arts by non-trivial margins. Moreover, experiments
demonstrate that TransPar can be integrated into the most popular deep UDA
networks and be easily extended to handle any data distribution shift
scenarios.]]></summary>

body model which is based on a dynamic surface function network. To this end,
we explicitly model the surface of the person using a multi-layer perceptron
(MLP) which is embedded into the canonical space of the SMPL body model. With
classical forward rendering, the represented surface can be rasterized using
the topology of a template mesh. For each surface point of the template mesh,
the MLP is evaluated to predict the actual surface location. To handle
pose-dependent deformations, the MLP is conditioned on the SMPL pose
parameters. We show that this surface representation as well as the pose
parameters can be learned in a self-supervised fashion using the principle of
analysis-by-synthesis and differentiable rasterization. As a result, we are
able to reconstruct a temporally coherent mesh sequence from the input data.

reported in this paper builds on this project through the use of transfer

approach is followed for selecting appropriate splitting ratios and for tuning
multiple training parameters including learning rate schedulers, layers
freezing, batch sizes and loss functions, in the context of the given scenario
which requires classification of waste into different recycling types. Results
are compared and contrasted using 10-fold cross validation and demonstrate that
the model developed achieves a 91.21% test accuracy. Subsequently, a range of
data augmentation techniques are then incorporated into this work including
flipping, rotation, shearing, zooming, and brightness control. Results show
that these augmentation techniques further improve the test accuracy of the
final model to 95.40%. Unlike other work reported in the field, this paper

critical importance for the development of the related solutions.
Unfortunately, the lack of ground-truths to be used as guidance for an
objective evaluation has pushed the community to resort to either
reference-based reduced-resolution indexes or to no-reference subjective
quality indexes that can be applied on full-resolution datasets. In particular,
the reference-based approach leverages on Wald's protocol, a resolution
degradation process that allows one to synthesize data with related ground
truth. Both solutions, however, present critical shortcomings that we aim to
mitigate in this work by means of an alternative no-reference full-resolution
framework. On one side we introduce a protocol, namely the reprojection
protocol, which allows to handle the spectral fidelity problem. On the other
side, a new index of the spatial consistency between the pansharpened image and
the panchromatic band at full resolution is proposed. The experimental results
show the effectiveness of the proposed approach which is confirmed also by
visual inspection.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Geometry Projection is a powerful depth estimation method in monocular 3D
object detection. It estimates depth dependent on heights, which introduces
mathematical priors into the deep model. But projection process also introduces
the error amplification problem, in which the error of the estimated height
will be amplified and reflected greatly at the output depth. This property
leads to uncontrollable depth inferences and also damages the training
efficiency. In this paper, we propose a Geometry Uncertainty Projection Network
(GUP Net) to tackle the error amplification problem at both inference and
training stages. Specifically, a GUP module is proposed to obtains the
geometry-guided uncertainty of the inferred depth, which not only provides high
reliable confidence for each depth but also benefits depth learning.
Furthermore, at the training stage, we propose a Hierarchical Task Learning
strategy to reduce the instability caused by error amplification. This learning
algorithm monitors the learning situation of each task by a proposed indicator
and adaptively assigns the proper loss weights for different tasks according to
their pre-tasks situation. Based on that, each task starts learning only when
its pre-tasks are learned well, which can significantly improve the stability
and efficiency of the training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. The overall model can infer more reliable

pretrained GAN models such as StyleGAN and BigGAN to be used for real image
editing applications. Meanwhile, GAN inversion also provides insights on the
interpretation of GAN's latent space and how the realistic images can be

on its recent algorithms and applications. We cover important techniques of GAN

we propose an Iterative Fusion based Recognizer (IFR) for low quality scene
text recognition, taking advantage of refined text images input and robust
feature representation. IFR contains two branches which focus on scene text
recognition and low quality scene text image recovery respectively. We utilize
an iterative collaboration between two branches, which can effectively
alleviate the impact of low quality input. A feature fusion module is proposed
to strengthen the feature representation of the two branches, where the
features from the Recognizer are Fused with image Restoration branch, referred
to as RRF. Without changing the recognition network structure, extensive
quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that the proposed method
significantly outperforms the baseline methods in boosting the recognition

medicine, especially for high-stakes recommendations in which access to certain
information can drastically alter the course of treatment, and thus, patient
outcome; a prominent example is radiomics for cancer subtyping. Because in
these scenarios the stakes are high, it is desirable for decision systems to
not only provide recommendations but supply transparent reasoning in support
thereof. For learning-based systems, this can be achieved through an
interpretable design of the inference pipeline. Herein we describe an automated
yet interpretable system for uveal melanoma subtyping with digital cytology
images from fine needle aspiration biopsies. Our method embeds every
automatically segmented cell of a candidate cytology image as a point in a 2D
manifold defined by many representative slides, which enables reasoning about
the cell-level composition of the tissue sample, paving the way for
interpretable subtyping of the biopsy. Finally, a rule-based slide-level
classification algorithm is trained on the partitions of the circularly
distorted 2D manifold. This process results in a simple rule set that is
evaluated automatically but highly transparent for human verification. On our
in house cytology dataset of 88 uveal melanoma patients, the proposed method
achieves an accuracy of 87.5% that compares favorably to all competing
approaches, including deep "black box" models. The method comes with a user
interface to facilitate interaction with cell-level content, which may offer
additional insights for pathological assessment.]]></summary>

decoder architecture to object detection and achieves promising performance. In
this paper, we handle the critical issue, slow training convergence, and
present a conditional cross-attention mechanism for fast DETR training. Our
approach is motivated by that the cross-attention in DETR relies highly on the
content embeddings for localizing the four extremities and predicting the box,
which increases the need for high-quality content embeddings and thus the
training difficulty. Our approach, named conditional DETR, learns a conditional
spatial query from the decoder embedding for decoder multi-head
cross-attention. The benefit is that through the conditional spatial query,
each cross-attention head is able to attend to a band containing a distinct
region, e.g., one object extremity or a region inside the object box. This
narrows down the spatial range for localizing the distinct regions for object
classification and box regression, thus relaxing the dependence on the content
embeddings and easing the training. Empirical results show that conditional
DETR converges 6.7x faster for the backbones R50 and R101 and 10x faster for
stronger backbones DC5-R50 and DC5-R101. Code is available at

requires a large amount of manually labeled data. However, most existing
learning-based approaches usually suffer from limited manually annotated
medical data, which poses a major practical problem for accurate and robust
medical image segmentation. In addition, most existing semi-supervised
approaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts,
and also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic
information, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we
present SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly
advances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning. We first describe
an unsupervised training strategy, which takes two views of an input volume and
predicts their signed distance maps of object boundaries in a contrastive
objective, with only two independent dropout as mask. This simple approach
works surprisingly well, performing on the same level as previous fully
supervised methods with much less labeled data. We hypothesize that dropout can
be viewed as a minimal form of data augmentation and makes the network robust
to representation collapse. Then, we propose to perform structural distillation
by distilling pair-wise similarities. We evaluate SimCVD on two popular
datasets: the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LA) and the NIH pancreas CT
dataset. The results on the LA dataset demonstrate that, in two types of
labeled ratios (i.e., 20% and 10%), SimCVD achieves an average Dice score of
90.85% and 89.03% respectively, a 0.91% and 2.22% improvement compared to
previous best results. Our method can be trained in an end-to-end fashion,
showing the promise of utilizing SimCVD as a general framework for downstream
tasks, such as medical image synthesis and registration.]]></summary>

secondary thought given to how to design models that can run efficiently on

the representational power of their first, feature extracting, layer. We find
that it is possible to radically simplify these models so long as the feature

further, we discover that it is possible to improve performance overall on
ModelNet40 and S3DIS by improving the design of the feature extractor. Our
approach reduces memory consumption by 20$\times$ and latency by up to
9.9$\times$ for graph layers in models such as DGCNN; overall, we achieve

slides. Most commonly, the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain is used in the
diagnostic workflow and it is the gold standard for cancer diagnosis. However,
in many cases, especially for non-neoplastic diseases, additional "special
stains" are used to provide different levels of contrast and color to tissue
components and allow pathologists to get a clearer diagnostic picture. In this
study, we demonstrate the utility of supervised learning-based computational
stain transformation from H&E to different special stains (Masson's Trichrome,
periodic acid-Schiff and Jones silver stain) using tissue sections from kidney
needle core biopsies. Based on evaluation by three renal pathologists, followed
by adjudication by a fourth renal pathologist, we show that the generation of
virtual special stains from existing H&E images improves the diagnosis in
several non-neoplastic kidney diseases sampled from 58 unique subjects. A
second study performed by three pathologists found that the quality of the
special stains generated by the stain transformation network was statistically
equivalent to those generated through standard histochemical staining. As the
transformation of H&E images into special stains can be achieved within 1 min
or less per patient core specimen slide, this stain-to-stain transformation
framework can improve the quality of the preliminary diagnosis when additional
special stains are needed, along with significant savings in time and cost,
reducing the burden on healthcare system and patients.]]></summary>

performance in computer vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic
segmentation (SS). However, recent studies have shown evident weaknesses of
such models against adversarial perturbations. In a real-world scenario
instead, like autonomous driving, more attention should be devoted to
real-world adversarial examples (RWAEs), which are physical objects (e.g.,
billboards and printable patches) optimized to be adversarial to the entire
perception pipeline. This paper presents an in-depth evaluation of the
robustness of popular SS models by testing the effects of both digital and
real-world adversarial patches. These patches are crafted with powerful attacks
enriched with a novel loss function. Firstly, an investigation on the
Cityscapes dataset is conducted by extending the Expectation Over
Transformation (EOT) paradigm to cope with SS. Then, a novel attack
optimization, called scene-specific attack, is proposed. Such an attack
leverages the CARLA driving simulator to improve the transferability of the
proposed EOT-based attack to a real 3D environment. Finally, a printed physical
billboard containing an adversarial patch was tested in an outdoor driving
scenario to assess the feasibility of the studied attacks in the real world.
Exhaustive experiments revealed that the proposed attack formulations
outperform previous work to craft both digital and real-world adversarial
patches for SS. At the same time, the experimental results showed how these
attacks are notably less effective in the real world, hence questioning the
practical relevance of adversarial attacks to SS models for autonomous/assisted
driving.]]></summary>

consists of two subtasks: occlusion boundary extraction and occlusion
orientation inference. Due to the essential differences between the two
subtasks in the feature expression at the higher and lower stages, it is
challenging to carry on them simultaneously in one network. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Dual-path Decoder Network, which uniformly extracts
occlusion information at higher stages and separates into two paths to recover
boundary and occlusion orientation respectively in lower stages. Besides,
considering the restriction of occlusion orientation presentation to occlusion
orientation learning, we design a new orthogonal representation for occlusion
orientation and proposed the Orthogonal Orientation Regression loss which can
get rid of the unfitness between occlusion representation and learning and
further prompt the occlusion orientation learning. Finally, we apply a
multi-scale loss together with our proposed orientation regression loss to
guide the boundary and orientation path learning respectively. Experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on PIOD

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vision-language Navigation (VLN) tasks require an agent to navigate
step-by-step while perceiving the visual observations and comprehending a
natural language instruction. Large data bias, which is caused by the disparity
ratio between the small data scale and large navigation space, makes the VLN
task challenging. Previous works have proposed various data augmentation
methods to reduce data bias. However, these works do not explicitly reduce the
data bias across different house scenes. Therefore, the agent would overfit to
the seen scenes and achieve poor navigation performance in the unseen scenes.
To tackle this problem, we propose the Random Environmental Mixup (REM) method,
which generates cross-connected house scenes as augmented data via mixuping
environment. Specifically, we first select key viewpoints according to the room
connection graph for each scene. Then, we cross-connect the key views of
different scenes to construct augmented scenes. Finally, we generate augmented
instruction-path pairs in the cross-connected scenes. The experimental results
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our augmentation data via REM help the
agent reduce its performance gap between the seen and unseen environment and
improve the overall performance, making our model the best existing approach on
the standard VLN benchmark.]]></summary>

semi-automatic image segmentation, especially in the biomedical field. However,
its linear asymptotic run time and memory requirements make application to 3D
datasets of increasing sizes impractical. We propose a hierarchical framework
that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to overcome these
restrictions for the random walker algorithm and achieves sublinear run time
and constant memory complexity. The goal of this framework is -- rather than
improving the segmentation quality compared to the baseline method -- to make
interactive segmentation on out-of-core datasets possible. The method is
evaluated quantitavely on synthetic data and the CT-ORG dataset where the
expected improvements in algorithm run time while maintaining high segmentation
quality are confirmed. The incremental (i.e., interaction update) run time is
demonstrated to be in seconds on a standard PC even for volumes of hundreds of
Gigabytes in size. In a small case study the applicability to large real world
from current biomedical research is demonstrated. An implementation of the
presented method is publicly available in version 5.2 of the widely used volume
rendering and processing software Voreen (https://www.uni-muenster.de/Voreen/).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Existing GAN inversion methods are stuck in a paradox that the inverted codes
can either achieve high-fidelity reconstruction, or retain the editing
capability. Having only one of them clearly cannot realize real image editing.
In this paper, we resolve this paradox by introducing consecutive images (\eg,
video frames or the same person with different poses) into the inversion
process. The rationale behind our solution is that the continuity of
consecutive images leads to inherent editable directions. This inborn property
is used for two unique purposes: 1) regularizing the joint inversion process,
such that each of the inverted code is semantically accessible from one of the
other and fastened in a editable domain; 2) enforcing inter-image coherence,
such that the fidelity of each inverted code can be maximized with the
complement of other images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
alternative significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
reconstruction fidelity and editability on both the real image dataset and
synthesis dataset. Furthermore, our method provides the first support of
video-based GAN inversion, and an interesting application of unsupervised
semantic transfer from consecutive images. Source code can be found at:

allow for better designs through low-cost iterations. While CAD programs are
typically taught to undergraduate students as a job skill, such software can
also help students learn engineering concepts. A current limitation of CAD
programs (even those that are specifically designed for educational purposes)
is that they are not capable of providing automated real-time help to students.
To encourage CAD programs to build in assistance to students, we used data
generated from students using a free, open source CAD software called Aladdin
to demonstrate how student data combined with machine learning techniques can
predict how well a particular student will perform in a design task. We
challenged students to design a house that consumed zero net energy as part of
an introductory engineering technology undergraduate course. Using data from
128 students, along with the scikit-learn Python machine learning library, we
tested our models using both total counts of design actions and sequences of
design actions as inputs. We found that our models using early design sequence
actions are particularly valuable for prediction. Our logistic regression model
achieved a >60% chance of predicting if a student would succeed in designing a
zero net energy house. Our results suggest that it would be feasible for
Aladdin to provide useful feedback to students when they are approximately
halfway through their design. Further improvements to these models could lead
to earlier predictions and thus provide students feedback sooner to enhance
their learning.]]></summary>

slots. Parking slot detection performance has been dramatically improved by
deep learning techniques. Deep learning-based object detection methods can be
categorized into one-stage and two-stage approaches. Although it is well-known
that the two-stage approach outperforms the one-stage approach in general
object detection, they have performed similarly in parking slot detection so
far. We consider this is because the two-stage approach has not yet been
adequately specialized for parking slot detection. Thus, this paper proposes a
highly specialized two-stage parking slot detector that uses region-specific
multi-scale feature extraction. In the first stage, the proposed method finds
the entrance of the parking slot as a region proposal by estimating its center,
length, and orientation. The second stage of this method designates specific
regions that most contain the desired information and extracts features from
them. That is, features for the location and orientation are separately
extracted from only the specific regions that most contain the locational and
orientational information. In addition, multi-resolution feature maps are
utilized to increase both positioning and classification accuracies. A
high-resolution feature map is used to extract detailed information (location
and orientation), while another low-resolution feature map is used to extract
semantic information (type and occupancy). In experiments, the proposed method
was quantitatively evaluated with two large-scale public parking slot detection
datasets and outperformed previous methods, including both one-stage and
two-stage approaches.]]></summary>

closely with human hosts, and get involved in modulating drug efficacy and drug
toxicity. Microbes have become novel targets for the development of
antibacterial agents. Therefore, screening of microbe-drug associations can
benefit greatly drug research and development. With the increase of microbial
genomic and pharmacological datasets, we are greatly motivated to develop an
effective computational method to identify new microbe-drug associations. In
this paper, we proposed a novel method, Graph2MDA, to predict microbe-drug
associations by using variational graph autoencoder (VGAE). We constructed
multi-modal attributed graphs based on multiple features of microbes and drugs,
such as molecular structures, microbe genetic sequences, and function
annotations. Taking as input the multi-modal attribute graphs, VGAE was trained
to learn the informative and interpretable latent representations of each node
and the whole graph, and then a deep neural network classifier was used to
predict microbe-drug associations. The hyperparameter analysis and model
ablation studies showed the sensitivity and robustness of our model. We
evaluated our method on three independent datasets and the experimental results
showed that our proposed method outperformed six existing state-of-the-art
methods. We also explored the meaningness of the learned latent representations
of drugs and found that the drugs show obvious clustering patterns that are
significantly consistent with drug ATC classification. Moreover, we conducted
case studies on two microbes and two drugs and found 75\%-95\% predicted
associations have been reported in PubMed literature. Our extensive performance
evaluations validated the effectiveness of our proposed method.\]]></summary>

improved results, but theoretical guarantees are still scarce. While some
progress on generalization properties of neural networks have been made, great
challenges remain. In this chapter, we discuss and combine these topics to
present a generalization error analysis for a class of neural networks suitable
for sparse reconstruction from few linear measurements. The hypothesis class
considered is inspired by the classical iterative soft-thresholding algorithm
(ISTA). The neural networks in this class are obtained by unfolding iterations
of ISTA and learning some of the weights. Based on training samples, we aim at
learning the optimal network parameters via empirical risk minimization and
thereby the optimal network that reconstructs signals from their compressive
linear measurements. In particular, we may learn a sparsity basis that is
shared by all of the iterations/layers and thereby obtain a new approach for
dictionary learning. For this class of networks, we present a generalization
bound, which is based on bounding the Rademacher complexity of hypothesis
classes consisting of such deep networks via Dudley's integral. Remarkably,
under realistic conditions, the generalization error scales only
logarithmically in the number of layers, and at most linear in number of
measurements.]]></summary>

and acceptability largely depend on their explicit and implicit interaction
capability with fellow human beings. As a result, social behavior is one of the
most sought-after qualities that a robot can possess. However, there is no
specific aspect and/or feature that defines socially acceptable behavior and it
largely depends on the situation, application, and society. In this article, we
investigate one such social behavior for collocated robots. Imagine a group of
people is interacting with each other and we want to join the group. We as
human beings do it in a socially acceptable manner, i.e., within the group, we
do position ourselves in such a way that we can participate in the group
activity without disturbing/obstructing anybody. To possess such a quality,
first, a robot needs to determine the formation of the group and then determine
a position for itself, which we humans do implicitly. The theory of f-formation
can be utilized for this purpose. As the types of formations can be very
diverse, detecting the social groups is not a trivial task. In this article, we
provide a comprehensive survey of the existing work on social interaction and
group detection using f-formation for robotics and other applications. We also
put forward a novel holistic survey framework combining all the possible
concerns and modules relevant to this problem. We define taxonomies based on
methods, camera views, datasets, detection capabilities and scale, evaluation
approaches, and application areas. We discuss certain open challenges and
limitations in current literature along with possible future research
directions based on this framework. In particular, we discuss the existing
methods/techniques and their relative merits and demerits, applications, and
provide a set of unsolved but relevant problems in this domain.]]></summary>

reproducibility of radiomics has limited its applicability to clinical
practice. This issue is especially prominent when radiomic features are
calculated from noisy images, such as low dose computed tomography (CT) scans.
In this article, we investigate the possibility of improving the
reproducibility of radiomic features calculated on noisy CTs by using
generative models for denoising.One traditional denoising method - non-local
means - and two generative models - encoder-decoder networks (EDN) and
conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) - were selected as the test
models. We added noise to the sinograms of full dose CTs to mimic low dose CTs
with two different levels of noise: low-noise CT and high-noise CT. Models were
trained on high-noise CTs and used to denoise low-noise CTs without
re-training. We also test the performance of our model in real data, using
dataset of same-day repeat low dose CTs to assess the reproducibility of
radiomic features in denoised images. The EDN and the CGAN improved the
concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) of radiomic features for low-noise
images from 0.87 to 0.92 and for high-noise images from 0.68 to 0.92
respectively. Moreover, the EDN and the CGAN improved the test-retest
reliability of radiomic features (mean CCC increased from 0.89 to 0.94) based
on real low dose CTs. The results show that denoising using EDN and CGANs can
improve the reproducibility of radiomic features calculated on noisy CTs.
Moreover, images with different noise levels can be denoised to improve the
reproducibility using these models without re-training, as long as the noise
intensity is equal or lower than that in high-noise CTs. To the authors'
knowledge, this is the first effort to improve the reproducibility of radiomic
features calculated on low dose CT scans.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep Learning has celebrated resounding successes in many application areas
of relevance to the Internet-of-Things, for example, computer vision and
machine listening. To fully harness the power of deep leaning for the IoT,
these technologies must ultimately be brought directly to the edge. The obvious
challenge is that deep learning techniques can only be implemented on strictly
resource-constrained edge devices if the models are radically downsized. This
task relies on different model compression techniques, such as network pruning,
quantization and the recent advancement of XNOR-Net. This paper examines the
suitability of these techniques for audio classification in microcontrollers.
We present an XNOR-Net for end-to-end raw audio classification and a
comprehensive empirical study comparing this approach with
pruning-and-quantization methods. We show that raw audio classification with
XNOR yields comparable performance to regular full precision networks for small
numbers of classes while reducing memory requirements 32-fold and computation
requirements 58-fold. However, as the number of classes increases
significantly, performance degrades and pruning-and-quantization based
compression techniques take over as the preferred technique being able to
satisfy the same space constraints but requiring about 8x more computation. We
show that these insights are consistent between raw audio classification and
image classification using standard benchmark sets.To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study applying XNOR to end-to-end audio
classification and evaluating it in the context of alternative techniques. All
code is publicly available on GitHub.]]></summary>

medical image analysis. Yet, no large-scale evaluation has been conducted to
benchmark the efficacy of newly-developed pre-training techniques for medical
image analysis, leaving several important questions unanswered. As the first
step in this direction, we conduct a systematic study on the transferability of
models pre-trained on iNat2021, the most recent large-scale fine-grained
dataset, and 14 top self-supervised ImageNet models on 7 diverse medical tasks
in comparison with the supervised ImageNet model. Furthermore, we present a
practical approach to bridge the domain gap between natural and medical images
by continually (pre-)training supervised ImageNet models on medical images. Our
comprehensive evaluation yields new insights: (1) pre-trained models on
fine-grained data yield distinctive local representations that are more
suitable for medical segmentation tasks, (2) self-supervised ImageNet models
learn holistic features more effectively than supervised ImageNet models, and
(3) continual pre-training can bridge the domain gap between natural and
medical images. We hope that this large-scale open evaluation of transfer
learning can direct the future research of deep learning for medical imaging.

data-driven methods are the two representative frameworks. However, both
approaches have their respective advantages and disadvantages. The model-driven
methods consider the imaging mechanism, which is deterministic and
theoretically reasonable; however, they cannot easily model complicated
nonlinear problems. The data-driven methods have a stronger prior knowledge
learning capability for huge data, especially for nonlinear statistical
features; however, the interpretability of the networks is poor, and they are
over-dependent on training data. In this paper, we systematically investigate
the coupling of model-driven and data-driven methods, which has rarely been
considered in the remote sensing image restoration and fusion communities. We
are the first to summarize the coupling approaches into the following three
categories: 1) data-driven and model-driven cascading methods; 2) variational
models with embedded learning; and 3) model-constrained network learning
methods. The typical existing and potential coupling methods for remote sensing
image restoration and fusion are introduced with application examples. This
paper also gives some new insights into the potential future directions, in

from the conventional low-rank parameterization, our method is not limited to

comparable performance to the original models while requiring 2.8 to 10.1 times
lower communication costs than the original models, which is not achievable by
the traditional low-rank parameterization. Moreover, the efficiency can be
further improved by combining our method and other efficient FL techniques
because our method is compatible with others. We also extend our method to a

to have not been treated). We address these two challenges by combining
structured inference and targeted learning. In terms of structure, we factorize
the joint distribution into risk, confounding, instrumental, and miscellaneous
factors, and in terms of targeted learning, we apply a regularizer derived from
the influence curve in order to reduce residual bias. An ablation study is

(CNN) architectures, suitable for an on-device processor with limited computing
resources, performing at substantially lower Network Architecture Search (NAS)
costs. A new algorithm entitled an Early Exit Population Initialisation (EE-PI)
for Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) was developed to achieve both goals. The EE-PI
reduces the total number of parameters in the search process by filtering the
models with fewer parameters than the maximum threshold. It will look for a new
model to replace those models with parameters more than the threshold. Thereby,
reducing the number of parameters, memory usage for model storage and
processing time while maintaining the same performance or accuracy. The search
time was reduced to 0.52 GPU day. This is a huge and significant achievement
compared to the NAS of 4 GPU days achieved using NSGA-Net, 3,150 GPU days by
the AmoebaNet model, and the 2,000 GPU days by the NASNet model. As well, Early
Exit Evolutionary Algorithm networks (EEEA-Nets) yield network architectures
with minimal error and computational cost suitable for a given dataset as a
class of network algorithms. Using EEEA-Net on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
ImageNet datasets, our experiments showed that EEEA-Net achieved the lowest
error rate among state-of-the-art NAS models, with 2.46% for CIFAR-10, 15.02%

cluster tree recursively in guide with our objective function. For practical
use, our resulting cluster tree is not binary. Our algorithm called HCSE
outputs a $k$-level cluster tree by a novel and interpretable mechanism to
choose $k$ automatically without any hyper-parameter. Our experimental results
on synthetic datasets show that HCSE has a great advantage in finding the

from the conventional low-rank parameterization, our method is not limited to

comparable performance to the original models while requiring 2.8 to 10.1 times

the traditional low-rank parameterization. Moreover, the efficiency can be
further improved by combining our method and other efficient FL techniques

success in various fields. However, many existing methods, especially low-cost
ones, are difficult to achieve real-time and long-term object detection and
tracking. Here, a non-imaging strategy is proposed, including two stages, to
realize fast-moving object detection and tracking in real-time and for the long
term: 1) a contour-moments-based method is proposed to optimize the Hadamard
pattern sequence. And then reconstructing projection curves of the object based
on single-pixel imaging technology. The projection curve, which including the
object location information, is reconstructed directly with the measurements
collected by a single-pixel detector; 2) The fastest changing position in the
projection curve can be obtained by solving first-order gradients. A gradient
differential is used in two first-order gradients to calculate a differential
curve with the sudden change positions. Finally, we can obtain the boundary
information of the fast-moving object. We experimentally demonstrate that our
approach can achieve a temporal resolution of 105 frames per second at a 1.28%
sampling rate by using a 22,000 Hz digital micro-mirror device. The detection
and tracking algorithm of the proposed strategy is computationally efficient.
Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our approach can make the sampling
rate lower. Additionally, the strategy acquires not more than 1MB of data for
each frame, which is capable of fast-moving object real-time and long-term
detection and tracking.]]></summary>

process points have become popular. Among all point-based models,
Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance by fully
preserving point interrelation. However, most of them spend high percentage of
total time on sparse data accessing (e.g., Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) and
neighbor points query), which becomes the computation burden. Therefore, we
present a novel 3D Transformer, called Point-Voxel Transformer (PVT) that
leverages self-attention computation in points to gather global context
features, while performing multi-head self-attention (MSA) computation in
voxels to capture local information and reduce the irregular data access.
Additionally, to further reduce the cost of MSA computation, we design a cyclic
shifted boxing scheme which brings greater efficiency by limiting the MSA
computation to non-overlapping local boxes while also preserving cross-box
connection. Our method fully exploits the potentials of Transformer
architecture, paving the road to efficient and accurate recognition results.
Evaluated on classification and segmentation benchmarks, our PVT not only
achieves strong accuracy but outperforms previous state-of-the-art
Transformer-based models with 9x measured speedup on average. For 3D object
detection task, we replace the primitives in Frustrum PointNet with PVT layer
and achieve the improvement of 8.6%.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While deep neural networks have shown impressive performance in many tasks,
they are fragile to carefully designed adversarial attacks. We propose a novel
adversarial training-based model by Attention Guided Knowledge Distillation and
Bi-directional Metric Learning (AGKD-BML). The attention knowledge is obtained
from a weight-fixed model trained on a clean dataset, referred to as a teacher
model, and transferred to a model that is under training on adversarial
examples (AEs), referred to as a student model. In this way, the student model
is able to focus on the correct region, as well as correcting the intermediate
features corrupted by AEs to eventually improve the model accuracy. Moreover,
to efficiently regularize the representation in feature space, we propose a
bidirectional metric learning. Specifically, given a clean image, it is first
attacked to its most confusing class to get the forward AE. A clean image in
the most confusing class is then randomly picked and attacked back to the
original class to get the backward AE. A triplet loss is then used to shorten
the representation distance between original image and its AE, while enlarge
that between the forward and backward AEs. We conduct extensive adversarial
robustness experiments on two widely used datasets with different attacks. Our
proposed AGKD-BML model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
approaches. The code of AGKD-BML will be available at:

provide not only the change locations but also the detailed semantic categories
(before and after the observation intervals). This fine-grained change
information is more useful in land-cover/land-use (LC/LU) applications. Recent
studies indicate that the SCD can be modeled through a triple-branch
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which contains two temporal branches and a
change branch. However, in this architecture, the connections between the
temporal branches and the change branch are weak. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel CNN architecture for the SCD, where the
temporal features are re-used and are deeply merged in the temporal branch.
Furthermore, we elaborate on this architecture to model the bi-temporal
semantic correlations. The resulting Bi-temporal Semantic Reasoning Network
(Bi-SRNet) contains two types of semantic reasoning blocks to reason both
single-temporal and cross-temporal semantic correlations, as well as a novel
loss function to improve the semantic consistency of change detection results.
Experimental results on a benchmark dataset show that the proposed architecture
obtains significant accuracy improvements over the existing approaches, while
the added designs in the Bi-SRNet further improves the segmentation of both
semantic categories and the changed areas. The codes in this paper are

autonomous vehicles, most of which highly dependent on Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs). Recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to
adversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed to understand and
generate adversarial examples, such as gradient based attack, score based
attack, decision based attack, and transfer based attacks. However, most of
these algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because (1)
iteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast
moving car and (2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally
without considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems,
this paper proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real world
road sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: (1)
we leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip
those zero-contributed areas - this also helps to generate natural
perturbations, (2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a
single perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance
of the pre-trained attention map, (3) we design a simple objective function
that can be easily optimized, (4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real
world data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the
attack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a
quarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also
provides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability.

better robustness in the real world. However, it remains nontrivial to better
adaptively balance effective multi-modal information in the feature fusion
phase. In this letter, we propose a novel gated recoding network (GRNet) to
evaluate the information validity of the two modes, and balance their
influence. Our framework is divided into three phases: perception phase,
recoding mixing phase and feature integration phase. First, A perception
encoder is adopted to extract multi-level single-modal features, which lays the
foundation for multi-modal semantic comparative analysis. Then, a
modal-adaptive gate unit (MGU) is proposed to suppress the invalid information
and transfer the effective modal features to the recoding mixer and the hybrid
branch decoder. The recoding mixer is responsible for recoding and mixing the
balanced multi-modal information. Finally, the hybrid branch decoder completes
the multi-level feature integration under the guidance of an optional edge
guidance stream (OEGS). Experiments and analysis on eight popular benchmarks
verify that our framework performs favorably against 9 state-of-art methods.]]></summary>

these requirements, networks have become more complex and thus require new
design methods and monitoring techniques, as they evolve towards becoming
autonomous. Machine learning has come to the forefront in recent years as a
promising technology to aid in this evolution. Optical fiber communications can
already provide the high capacity required for most applications, however,
there is a need for increased scalability and adaptability to changing user
demands and link conditions. Accurate performance monitoring is an integral
part of this transformation. In this paper we review optical performance
monitoring techniques where machine learning algorithms have been applied.
Moreover, since alot of OPM depends on knowledge of the signal type, we also
review work for modulation format recognition and bitrate identification. We
additionally briefly introduce a neuromorphic approach to OPM as an emerging

attracts increasing attentions in recent years. Inspired by the recent success
of unsupervised contrastive learning, we aim to learn graph-level
representation in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, we propose a novel
unsupervised graph learning paradigm called Iterative Graph Self-Distillation
(IGSD) which iteratively performs the teacher-student distillation with graph
augmentations. Different from conventional knowledge distillation, IGSD
constructs the teacher with an exponential moving average of the student model
and distills the knowledge of itself. The intuition behind IGSD is to predict
the teacher network representation of the graph pairs under different augmented
views. As a natural extension, we also apply IGSD to semi-supervised scenarios
by jointly regularizing the network with both supervised and unsupervised
contrastive loss. Finally, we show that finetuning the IGSD-trained models with
self-training can further improve the graph representation power. Empirically,
we achieve significant and consistent performance gain on various graph
datasets in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings, which well
validates the superiority of IGSD.]]></summary>

field. A distinct characteristic in vehicle tracking is that the trajectories
of vehicles are fairly smooth in both the world coordinate and the image
coordinate. Hence, models that capture motion consistencies are of high
necessity. However, tracking with the standalone motion-based trackers is quite
challenging because targets could get lost easily due to limited information,
detection error and occlusion. Leveraging appearance information to assist
object re-identification could resolve this challenge to some extent. However,
doing so requires extra computation while appearance information is sensitive
to occlusion as well. In this paper, we try to explore the significance of
motion patterns for vehicle tracking without appearance information. We propose
a novel approach that tackles the association issue for long-term tracking with
the exclusive fully-exploited motion information. We address the tracklet
embedding issue with the proposed reconstruct-to-embed strategy based on deep
graph convolutional neural networks (GCN). Comprehensive experiments on the
KITTI-car tracking dataset and UA-Detrac dataset show that the proposed method,
though without appearance information, could achieve competitive performance
with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers. The source code will be available at

inherently is to build a subset of OOD samples and then suppress predictions on

is close to that of in-distribution samples, and thus could be utilized to
alleviate the OOD overconfidence issue effectively by suppressing predictions
on them. To obtain CODEs, we first generate seed OOD examples via
slicing&splicing operations on in-distribution samples from different
categories, and then feed them to the Chamfer generative adversarial network
for distribution transformation, without accessing to any extra data. Training
with suppressing predictions on CODEs is validated to alleviate the OOD
overconfidence issue largely without hurting classification accuracy, and
outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, we demonstrate CODEs are
useful for improving OOD detection and classification.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer the knowledge learnt
from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Previous work is
mainly built upon convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn
domain-invariant representations. With the recent exponential increase in
applying Vision Transformer (ViT) to vision tasks, the capability of ViT in
adapting cross-domain knowledge, however, remains unexplored in the literature.
To fill this gap, this paper first comprehensively investigates the
transferability of ViT on a variety of domain adaptation tasks. Surprisingly,
ViT demonstrates superior transferability over its CNNs-based counterparts with
a large margin, while the performance can be further improved by incorporating
adversarial adaptation. Notwithstanding, directly using CNNs-based adaptation
strategies fails to take the advantage of ViT's intrinsic merits (e.g.,
attention mechanism and sequential image representation) which play an
important role in knowledge transfer. To remedy this, we propose an unified
framework, namely Transferable Vision Transformer (TVT), to fully exploit the
transferability of ViT for domain adaptation. Specifically, we delicately
devise a novel and effective unit, which we term Transferability Adaption
Module (TAM). By injecting learned transferabilities into attention blocks, TAM
compels ViT focus on both transferable and discriminative features. Besides, we
leverage discriminative clustering to enhance feature diversity and separation
which are undermined during adversarial domain alignment. To verify its
versatility, we perform extensive studies of TVT on four benchmarks and the
experimental results demonstrate that TVT attains significant improvements
compared to existing state-of-the-art UDA methods.]]></summary>

on-line signature verification systems on popular scenarios (office/mobile) and
writing inputs (stylus/finger) through large-scale public databases. Three
different tasks are considered in the competition, simulating realistic
scenarios as both random and skilled forgeries are simultaneously considered on
each task. The results obtained in SVC-onGoing prove the high potential of deep
learning methods in comparison with traditional methods. In particular, the
best signature verification system has obtained Equal Error Rate (EER) values
of 3.33% (Task 1), 7.41% (Task 2), and 6.04% (Task 3). Future studies in the

usually clustered by first removing incomplete cases or features with missing
values, or by imputing missing values, followed by application of a clustering

observed values, assuming a finite mixture model of multivariate $t$

expectation-maximization (EM) approach that considers the missing values in the
incomplete data set and makes a missing at random (MAR) assumption, as well as
case deletion and imputation methods. Since only the observed values are
utilized, our approach is computationally more efficient than imputation or
full EM. Simulation studies demonstrate that our approach has favorable
recovery of the true cluster partition compared to case deletion and imputation
under various missingness mechanisms, and is at least competitive with the full
EM approach, even when MAR assumptions are violated. Our methodology is
demonstrated on a problem of clustering gamma-ray bursts and is implemented at

Disease diagnosis use different biomarker combinations to classify patients,

However, to improve our understanding of the disease, it is paramount to
extract such knowledge from the learned model. In this paper, we propose a Deep
Factorization Machine model that combines the ability of DNNs to learn complex
relationships and the ease of interpretability of a linear model. The proposed
model has three parts: (i) an embedding layer to deal with sparse categorical
data, (ii) a Factorization Machine to efficiently learn pairwise interactions,
and (iii) a DNN to implicitly model higher order interactions. In our
experiments on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we
demonstrate that our proposed model classifies cognitive normal, mild cognitive

emphasize the natural effect of photorealistic image stylization. In general,
distortion of the image content and lacking of details are two typical issues
in the style transfer field. To this end, we design a novel framework employing
the U-Net structure to maintain the rich spatial clues, with a multi-layer
feature aggregation (MFA) method to simultaneously provide the details obtained
by the shallow layers in the stylization processing. In particular, an encoder
based on the dense block and a decoder form a symmetrical structure of U-Net
are jointly staked to realize an effective feature extraction and image
reconstruction. Besides, a transfer module based on MFA and "adaptive instance
normalization" (AdaIN) is inserted in the skip connection positions to achieve
the stylization. Accordingly, the stylized image possesses the texture of a
real photo and preserves rich content details without introducing any mask or
post-processing steps. The experimental results on public datasets demonstrate
that our method achieves a more faithful structural similarity with a lower
style loss, reflecting the effectiveness and merit of our approach.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motivated by the success of masked language modeling~(MLM) in pre-training
natural language processing models, we propose w2v-BERT that explores MLM for
self-supervised speech representation learning. w2v-BERT is a framework that
combines contrastive learning and MLM, where the former trains the model to
discretize input continuous speech signals into a finite set of discriminative
speech tokens, and the latter trains the model to learn contextualized speech
representations via solving a masked prediction task consuming the discretized
tokens. In contrast to existing MLM-based speech pre-training frameworks such
as HuBERT, which relies on an iterative re-clustering and re-training process,
or vq-wav2vec, which concatenates two separately trained modules, w2v-BERT can
be optimized in an end-to-end fashion by solving the two self-supervised
tasks~(the contrastive task and MLM) simultaneously. Our experiments show that
w2v-BERT achieves competitive results compared to current state-of-the-art
pre-trained models on the LibriSpeech benchmarks when using the Libri-Light~60k
corpus as the unsupervised data. In particular, when compared to published
models such as conformer-based wav2vec~2.0 and HuBERT, our model shows~5\%
to~10\% relative WER reduction on the test-clean and test-other subsets. When
applied to the Google's Voice Search traffic dataset, w2v-BERT outperforms our
internal conformer-based wav2vec~2.0 by more than~30\% relatively.]]></summary>

their advancements in computer vision, along with their unprecedented size and
amounts of training data, many have come to believe that they are not suitable
for small sets of data. This trend leads to great concerns, including but not
limited to: limited availability of data in certain scientific domains and the
exclusion of those with limited resource from research in the field. In this
paper, we dispel the myth that transformers are "data hungry" and therefore can
only be applied to large sets of data. We show for the first time that with the
right size and tokenization, transformers can perform head-to-head with
state-of-the-art CNNs on small datasets, often with better accuracy and fewer
parameters. Our model eliminates the requirement for class token and positional
embeddings through a novel sequence pooling strategy and the use of
convolution/s. It is flexible in terms of model size, and can have as little as
0.28M parameters while achieving good results. Our model can reach 98.00%
accuracy when training from scratch on CIFAR-10, which is a significant
improvement over previous Transformer based models. It also outperforms many
modern CNN based approaches, such as ResNet, and even some recent NAS-based
approaches, such as Proxyless-NAS. Our simple and compact design democratizes
transformers by making them accessible to those with limited computing
resources and/or dealing with small datasets. Our method also works on larger
datasets, such as ImageNet (82.71% accuracy with 29% parameters of ViT), and
NLP tasks as well. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at

contrastive losses and evaluate its performance by the downstream tasks of
video action recognition, audio event classification, image classification, and

41.1% on Moments in Time, new records while avoiding supervised pre-training.
Transferring to image classification leads to 78.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet

learn value functions of a single target policy. However, when value functions
are updated to track the learned policy, they forget potentially useful
information about old policies. We introduce a class of value functions called
Parameter-Based Value Functions (PBVFs) whose inputs include the policy
parameters. They can generalize across different policies. PBVFs can evaluate
the performance of any policy given a state, a state-action pair, or a
distribution over the RL agent's initial states. First we show how PBVFs yield
novel off-policy policy gradient theorems. Then we derive off-policy
actor-critic algorithms based on PBVFs trained by Monte Carlo or Temporal
Difference methods. We show how learned PBVFs can zero-shot learn new policies
that outperform any policy seen during training. Finally our algorithms are
evaluated on a selection of discrete and continuous control tasks using shallow
policies and deep neural networks. Their performance is comparable to

Networks (DNNs), in many research domains in 2010s, several ML-based approaches
were proposed for detection in large inverse linear problems, e.g., massive
MIMO systems. The main motivation behind is that the complexity of Maximum
A-Posteriori (MAP) detection grows exponentially with system dimensions.
Instead of using DNNs, essentially being a black-box, we take a slightly
different approach and introduce a probabilistic Continuous relaxation of
disCrete variables to MAP detection. Enabling close approximation and
continuous optimization, we derive an iterative detection algorithm: Concrete
MAP Detection (CMD). Furthermore, extending CMD by the idea of deep unfolding
into CMDNet, we allow for (online) optimization of a small number of parameters
to different working points while limiting complexity. In contrast to recent
DNN-based approaches, we select the optimization criterion and output of CMDNet
based on information theory and are thus able to learn approximate
probabilities of the individual optimal detector. This is crucial for soft
decoding in today's communication systems. Numerical simulation results in MIMO
systems reveal CMDNet to feature a promising accuracy complexity trade-off
compared to State of the Art. Notably, we demonstrate CMDNet's soft outputs to
be reliable for decoders.]]></summary>

applications, e.g., urban planning, traffic scheduling, epidemic modeling, and
risk control. However, due to the limitations of data collection, including
infrastructure density, user privacy, and business security, such fine-grained
data is hard to collect and usually, only coarse-grained data is available.
Thus, obtaining fine-grained population distribution from coarse-grained
distribution becomes an important problem. To complete this task, existing
methods mainly rely on sufficient fine-grained ground truth for training, which
is not often available. This limits the applications of these methods and
brings the necessity to transfer knowledge from data-sufficient cities to
data-scarce cities.

In knowledge transfer scenario, we employ single reference fine-grained
ground truth in the target city as the ground truth to inform the large-scale
urban structure and support the knowledge transfer in the target city. By this
approach, we transform the fine-grained population mapping problem into a
one-shot transfer learning problem for population mapping task.

In this paper, we propose a one-shot transfer learning framework, PSRNet, to
transfer spatial-temporal knowledge across cities in fine-grained population
mapping task from the view of network structure, data, and optimization.
Experiments on real-life datasets of 4 cities demonstrate that PSRNet has
significant advantages over 8 baselines by reducing RMSE and MAE for more than
25%. Our code and datasets are released in Github.]]></summary>

inputs either at test time or at training time. This has received much recent
interest on the empirical front due to applications where reliability and
security are critical. However, theoretical understanding of algorithms that
are robust to adversarial perturbations is limited.

In this work we focus on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a ubiquitous
algorithmic primitive in machine learning. We formulate a natural robust
variant of PCA where the goal is to find a low dimensional subspace to
represent the given data with minimum projection error, that is in addition
robust to small perturbations measured in $\ell_q$ norm (say $q=\infty$).
Unlike PCA which is solvable in polynomial time, our formulation is
computationally intractable to optimize as it captures a variant of the
well-studied sparse PCA objective as a special case. We show the following
results:

-Polynomial time algorithm that is constant factor competitive in the
worst-case with respect to the best subspace, in terms of the projection error
and the robustness criterion.

-We show that our algorithmic techniques can also be made robust to
adversarial training-time perturbations, in addition to yielding
representations that are robust to adversarial perturbations at test time.
Specifically, we design algorithms for a strong notion of training-time
perturbations, where every point is adversarially perturbed up to a specified
amount.

-We illustrate the broad applicability of our algorithmic techniques in
addressing robustness to adversarial perturbations, both at training time and
test time. In particular, our adversarially robust PCA primitive leads to
computationally efficient and robust algorithms for both unsupervised and
supervised learning problems such as clustering and learning adversarially
robust classifiers.]]></summary>

which data become available over time, like network monitoring, stock price
prediction, job applications, etc. The underlying data distribution might
evolve over time calling for model adaptation as new instances arrive and old
instances become obsolete. In such dynamic environments, the so-called data
streams, fairness-aware learning cannot be considered as a one-off requirement,
but rather it should comprise a continual requirement over the stream. Recent
fairness-aware stream classifiers ignore the problem of class imbalance, which
manifests in many real-life applications, and mitigate discrimination mainly
because they "reject" minority instances at large due to their inability to
effectively learn all classes.

In this work, we propose \ours, an online fairness-aware approach that
maintains a valid and fair classifier over the stream. \ours~is an online
boosting approach that changes the training distribution in an online fashion
by monitoring stream's class imbalance and tweaks its decision boundary to
mitigate discriminatory outcomes over the stream. Experiments on 8 real-world
and 1 synthetic datasets from different domains with varying class imbalance
demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art fairness-aware
stream approaches with a range (relative) increase [11.2\%-14.2\%] in balanced

approximate a broad range of functions. An important problem in the theory of
deep neural networks is expressivity; that is, we want to understand the
functions that are computable by a given network. We study real infinitely
differentiable (smooth) hierarchical functions implemented by feedforward
neural networks via composing simpler functions in two cases:

1) each constituent function of the composition has fewer inputs than the
resulting function;

2) constituent functions are in the more specific yet prevalent form of a
non-linear univariate function (e.g. tanh) applied to a linear multivariate
function.

We establish that in each of these regimes there exist non-trivial algebraic
partial differential equations (PDEs), which are satisfied by the computed
functions. These PDEs are purely in terms of the partial derivatives and are
dependent only on the topology of the network. For compositions of polynomial
functions, the algebraic PDEs yield non-trivial equations (of degrees dependent
only on the architecture) in the ambient polynomial space that are satisfied on
the associated functional varieties. Conversely, we conjecture that such PDE
constraints, once accompanied by appropriate non-singularity conditions and
perhaps certain inequalities involving partial derivatives, guarantee that the
smooth function under consideration can be represented by the network. The
conjecture is verified in numerous examples including the case of tree
architectures which are of neuroscientific interest. Our approach is a step
toward formulating an algebraic description of functional spaces associated
with specific neural networks, and may provide new, useful tools for
constructing neural networks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In reacting flow systems, thermoacoustic instability characterized by high
amplitude pressure fluctuations, is driven by a positive coupling between the
unsteady heat release rate and the acoustic field of the combustor. When the
underlying flow is turbulent, as a control parameter of the system is varied
and the system approach thermoacoustic instability, the acoustic pressure
oscillations synchronize with heat release rate oscillations. Consequently,
during the onset of thermoacoustic instability in turbulent combustors, the
system dynamics transition from chaotic oscillations to periodic oscillations
via a state of intermittency. Thermoacoustic systems are traditionally modeled
by coupling the model for the unsteady heat source and the acoustic subsystem,
each estimated independently. The response of the unsteady heat source, the
flame, to acoustic fluctuations are characterized by introducing external
unsteady forcing. This necessitates a powerful excitation module to obtain the
nonlinear response of the flame to acoustic perturbations. Instead of
characterizing individual subsystems, we introduce a neural ordinary
differential equation (neural ODE) framework to model the thermoacoustic system
as a whole. The neural ODE model for the thermoacoustic system uses time series
of the heat release rate and the pressure fluctuations, measured simultaneously
without introducing any external perturbations, to model their coupled
interaction. Further, we use the parameters of neural ODE to define an anomaly
measure that represents the proximity of system dynamics to limit cycle
oscillations and thus provide an early warning signal for the onset of

be realized by constructing the quantum circuit as a unitary that transforms
the initial state to the target, or implementing a quantum control protocol to
evolve to the target state with a designed Hamiltonian. In this work, we study
the latter on quantum many-body systems by the time evolution with fixed
couplings and variational magnetic fields. In specific, we consider to prepare
the ground states of the Hamiltonians containing certain interactions that are
missing in the Hamiltonians for the time evolution. An optimization method is
proposed to optimize the magnetic fields by "fine-graining" the discretization
of time, in order to gain high precision and stability. The back propagation
technique is utilized to obtain the gradients of the fields against the
logarithmic fidelity. Our method is tested on preparing the ground state of
Heisenberg chain with the time evolution by the XY and Ising interactions, and
its performance surpasses two baseline methods that use local and global
optimization strategies, respectively. Our work can be applied and generalized
to other quantum models such as those defined on higher dimensional lattices.
It enlightens to reduce the complexity of the required interactions for
implementing quantum control or other tasks in quantum information and
computation by means of optimizing the magnetic fields.]]></summary>

$\mathbb{R}^d$ under the setting where the unlabeled data distribution is
isotropic log-concave and each label is flipped with probability at most $\eta$
for a parameter $\eta \in \big[0, \frac12\big)$, known as the bounded noise.
Even in the presence of mild label noise, i.e. $\eta$ is a small constant, this
is a challenging problem and only recently have label complexity bounds of the
form $\tilde{O}\big(s \cdot \mathrm{polylog}(d, \frac{1}{\epsilon})\big)$ been
established in [Zhang, 2018] for computationally efficient algorithms. In
contrast, under high levels of label noise, the label complexity bounds
achieved by computationally efficient algorithms are much worse: the best known
result of [Awasthi et al., 2016] provides a computationally efficient algorithm
with label complexity $\tilde{O}\big((\frac{s \ln
d}{\epsilon})^{2^{\mathrm{poly}(1/(1-2\eta))}} \big)$, which is label-efficient
only when the noise rate $\eta$ is a fixed constant. In this work, we
substantially improve on it by designing a polynomial time algorithm for active
learning of $s$-sparse halfspaces, with a label complexity of
$\tilde{O}\big(\frac{s}{(1-2\eta)^4} \mathrm{polylog} (d, \frac 1 \epsilon)
\big)$. This is the first efficient algorithm with label complexity polynomial
in $\frac{1}{1-2\eta}$ in this setting, which is label-efficient even for
$\eta$ arbitrarily close to $\frac12$. Our active learning algorithm and its
theoretical guarantees also immediately translate to new state-of-the-art label
and sample complexity results for full-dimensional active and passive halfspace
learning under arbitrary bounded noise. The key insight of our algorithm and
analysis is a new interpretation of online learning regret inequalities, which
may be of independent interest.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past decade, the advent of cybercrime has accelarated the research
on cybersecurity. However, the deployment of intrusion detection methods falls
short. One of the reasons for this is the lack of realistic evaluation
datasets, which makes it a challenge to develop techniques and compare them.
This is caused by the large amounts of effort it takes for a cyber analyst to
classify network connections. This has raised the need for methods (i) that can
learn from small sets of labeled data, (ii) that can make predictions on large
sets of unlabeled data, and (iii) that request the label of only specially
selected unlabeled data instances. Hence, Active Learning (AL) methods are of
interest. These approaches choose speci?fic unlabeled instances by a query
function that are expected to improve overall classi?cation performance. The
resulting query observations are labeled by a human expert and added to the
labeled set.

In this paper, we propose a new hybrid AL method called Jasmine. Firstly, it
determines how suitable each observation is for querying, i.e., how likely it
is to enhance classi?cation. These properties are the uncertainty score and
anomaly score. Secondly, Jasmine introduces dynamic updating. This allows the
model to adjust the balance between querying uncertain, anomalous and randomly
selected observations. To this end, Jasmine is able to learn the best query
strategy during the labeling process. This is in contrast to the other AL
methods in cybersecurity that all have static, predetermined query functions.
We show that dynamic updating, and therefore Jasmine, is able to consistently
obtain good and more robust results than querying only uncertainties, only
anomalies or a ?fixed combination of the two.]]></summary>

continue to be among the most popular and powerful machine learning models used
across multiple disciplines. The conventional wisdom of estimating the impact
of a feature in tree based models is to measure the \textit{node-wise reduction
of a loss function}, which (i) yields only global importance measures and (ii)
is known to suffer from severe biases. Conditional feature contributions (CFCs)
provide \textit{local}, case-by-case explanations of a prediction by following
the decision path and attributing changes in the expected output of the model
to each feature along the path. However, Lundberg et al. pointed out a
potential bias of CFCs which depends on the distance from the root of a tree.
The by now immensely popular alternative, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP)
values appear to mitigate this bias but are computationally much more
expensive. Here we contribute a thorough comparison of the explanations
computed by both methods on a set of 164 publicly available classification
problems in order to provide data-driven algorithm recommendations to current
researchers. For random forests, we find extremely high similarities and
correlations of both local and global SHAP values and CFC scores, leading to
very similar rankings and interpretations. Analogous conclusions hold for the
fidelity of using global feature importance scores as a proxy for the
predictive power associated with each feature.]]></summary>

fast-pacing life. Current intelligent systems such as Siri, Google Assistant,
Microsoft Cortona, etc., have limited capability. For example, if you want to
wake up at 6 am because you have an upcoming trip, you have to set the alarm
manually. Besides, these systems do not recommend or remind what else to carry,
such as carrying an umbrella during a likely rain. The present work proposes a
system that takes an email as input and returns a recommendation-cumreminder
list. As a first step, we parse the emails, recognize the entities using named
entity recognition (NER). In the second step, information retrieval over the
web is done to identify nearby places, climatic conditions, etc. Imperative
sentences from the reviews of all places are extracted and passed to the object
extraction module. The main challenge lies in extracting the objects (items) of
interest from the review. To solve it, a modified Machine Reading
Comprehension-NER (MRC-NER) model is trained to tag objects of interest by
formulating annotation rules as a query. The objects so found are recommended
to the user one day in advance. The final reminder list of objects is pruned by
our proposed model for tracking objects kept during the "packing activity."
Eventually, when the user leaves for the event/trip, an alert is sent
containing the reminding list items. Our approach achieves superior performance
compared to several baselines by as much as 30% on recall and 10% on precision.]]></summary>

autonomous vehicles, most of which highly dependent on Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs). Recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to
adversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed to understand and
generate adversarial examples, such as gradient based attack, score based
attack, decision based attack, and transfer based attacks. However, most of
these algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because (1)
iteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast
moving car and (2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally
without considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems,
this paper proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real world
road sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: (1)
we leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip
those zero-contributed areas - this also helps to generate natural
perturbations, (2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a
single perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance
of the pre-trained attention map, (3) we design a simple objective function
that can be easily optimized, (4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real
world data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the
attack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a
quarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also
provides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability.

unsupervised nature of the proposed strategy comes with a cost in terms of
accuracy, when compared to more traditional supervised techniques. On the other
hand, there is a qualitative gain in generalizing the experimental sensitivity
beyond the ensemble of pre-computed signal templates. The recurrent autoencoder

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Robots in our daily surroundings are increasing day by day. Their usability
and acceptability largely depend on their explicit and implicit interaction
capability with fellow human beings. As a result, social behavior is one of the
most sought-after qualities that a robot can possess. However, there is no
specific aspect and/or feature that defines socially acceptable behavior and it
largely depends on the situation, application, and society. In this article, we
investigate one such social behavior for collocated robots. Imagine a group of
people is interacting with each other and we want to join the group. We as
human beings do it in a socially acceptable manner, i.e., within the group, we
do position ourselves in such a way that we can participate in the group
activity without disturbing/obstructing anybody. To possess such a quality,
first, a robot needs to determine the formation of the group and then determine
a position for itself, which we humans do implicitly. The theory of f-formation
can be utilized for this purpose. As the types of formations can be very
diverse, detecting the social groups is not a trivial task. In this article, we
provide a comprehensive survey of the existing work on social interaction and
group detection using f-formation for robotics and other applications. We also
put forward a novel holistic survey framework combining all the possible
concerns and modules relevant to this problem. We define taxonomies based on
methods, camera views, datasets, detection capabilities and scale, evaluation
approaches, and application areas. We discuss certain open challenges and
limitations in current literature along with possible future research
directions based on this framework. In particular, we discuss the existing
methods/techniques and their relative merits and demerits, applications, and
provide a set of unsolved but relevant problems in this domain.]]></summary>

slides. Most commonly, the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain is used in the
diagnostic workflow and it is the gold standard for cancer diagnosis. However,
in many cases, especially for non-neoplastic diseases, additional "special
stains" are used to provide different levels of contrast and color to tissue
components and allow pathologists to get a clearer diagnostic picture. In this
study, we demonstrate the utility of supervised learning-based computational
stain transformation from H&E to different special stains (Masson's Trichrome,
periodic acid-Schiff and Jones silver stain) using tissue sections from kidney
needle core biopsies. Based on evaluation by three renal pathologists, followed
by adjudication by a fourth renal pathologist, we show that the generation of
virtual special stains from existing H&E images improves the diagnosis in
several non-neoplastic kidney diseases sampled from 58 unique subjects. A
second study performed by three pathologists found that the quality of the
special stains generated by the stain transformation network was statistically
equivalent to those generated through standard histochemical staining. As the
transformation of H&E images into special stains can be achieved within 1 min
or less per patient core specimen slide, this stain-to-stain transformation
framework can improve the quality of the preliminary diagnosis when additional
special stains are needed, along with significant savings in time and cost,
reducing the burden on healthcare system and patients.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables a learning machine to adapt from
a labeled source domain to an unlabeled domain under the distribution shift.
Thanks to the strong representation ability of deep neural networks, recent
remarkable achievements in UDA resort to learning domain-invariant features.
Intuitively, the hope is that a good feature representation, together with the
hypothesis learned from the source domain, can generalize well to the target
domain. However, the learning processes of domain-invariant features and source
hypothesis inevitably involve domain-specific information that would degrade
the generalizability of UDA models on the target domain. In this paper,
motivated by the lottery ticket hypothesis that only partial parameters are
essential for generalization, we find that only partial parameters are
essential for learning domain-invariant information and generalizing well in
UDA. Such parameters are termed transferable parameters. In contrast, the other
parameters tend to fit domain-specific details and often fail to generalize,
which we term as untransferable parameters. Driven by this insight, we propose
Transferable Parameter Learning (TransPar) to reduce the side effect brought by
domain-specific information in the learning process and thus enhance the
memorization of domain-invariant information. Specifically, according to the
distribution discrepancy degree, we divide all parameters into transferable and
untransferable ones in each training iteration. We then perform separate
updates rules for the two types of parameters. Extensive experiments on image
classification and regression tasks (keypoint detection) show that TransPar
outperforms prior arts by non-trivial margins. Moreover, experiments
demonstrate that TransPar can be integrated into the most popular deep UDA
networks and be easily extended to handle any data distribution shift
scenarios.]]></summary>

Disease diagnosis use different biomarker combinations to classify patients,
but do not allow extracting knowledge about the interactions of biomarkers.
However, to improve our understanding of the disease, it is paramount to
extract such knowledge from the learned model. In this paper, we propose a Deep
Factorization Machine model that combines the ability of DNNs to learn complex
relationships and the ease of interpretability of a linear model. The proposed
model has three parts: (i) an embedding layer to deal with sparse categorical
data, (ii) a Factorization Machine to efficiently learn pairwise interactions,
and (iii) a DNN to implicitly model higher order interactions. In our
experiments on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we
demonstrate that our proposed model classifies cognitive normal, mild cognitive
impaired, and demented patients more accurately than competing models. In
addition, we show that valuable knowledge about the interactions among
biomarkers can be obtained.]]></summary>

children playing, adults working together (i.e., team sports), or strangers
navigating through a crowd. Joint action brings individuals (and embodiment of
their emotions) together, in space and in time. Yet little is known about how
individual emotions propagate through embodied presence in a group, and how
joint action changes individual emotion. In fact, the multi-agent component is
largely missing from neuroscience-based approaches to emotion, and reversely
joint action research has not found a way yet to include emotion as one of the
key parameters to model socio-motor interaction. In this review, we first
identify the gap and then stockpile evidence showing strong entanglement
between emotion and acting together from various branches of sciences. We
propose an integrative approach to bridge the gap, highlight five research
avenues to do so in behavioral neuroscience and digital sciences, and address
some of the key challenges in the area faced by modern societies.]]></summary>

using deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks or
recurrent neural networks. Many state-of-the-art solutions are based on image
classification frameworks and, as such, a 2D representation of the audio signal
is considered for training these networks. Finding the most suitable audio
representation is still a research area of interest. In this paper, different
log-Mel representations and combinations are analyzed. Experiments show that
the best results are obtained using the harmonic and percussive components plus
the difference between left and right stereo channels, (L-R). On the other
hand, it is a common strategy to ensemble different models in order to increase
the final accuracy. Even though averaging different model predictions is a
common choice, an exhaustive analysis of different ensemble techniques has not
been presented in ASC problems. In this paper, geometric and arithmetic mean
plus the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator are studied as aggregation
operators for the output of the different models of the ensemble. Finally, the
work carried out in this paper is highly oriented towards real-time
implementations. In this context, as the number of applications for audio
classification on edge devices is increasing exponentially, we also analyze
different network depths and efficient solutions for aggregating ensemble
predictions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Automated segmentation in medical image analysis is a challenging task that
requires a large amount of manually labeled data. However, most existing
learning-based approaches usually suffer from limited manually annotated
medical data, which poses a major practical problem for accurate and robust
medical image segmentation. In addition, most existing semi-supervised
approaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts,
and also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic
information, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we
present SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly
advances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning. We first describe
an unsupervised training strategy, which takes two views of an input volume and
predicts their signed distance maps of object boundaries in a contrastive
objective, with only two independent dropout as mask. This simple approach
works surprisingly well, performing on the same level as previous fully
supervised methods with much less labeled data. We hypothesize that dropout can
be viewed as a minimal form of data augmentation and makes the network robust
to representation collapse. Then, we propose to perform structural distillation
by distilling pair-wise similarities. We evaluate SimCVD on two popular
datasets: the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LA) and the NIH pancreas CT
dataset. The results on the LA dataset demonstrate that, in two types of
labeled ratios (i.e., 20% and 10%), SimCVD achieves an average Dice score of
90.85% and 89.03% respectively, a 0.91% and 2.22% improvement compared to
previous best results. Our method can be trained in an end-to-end fashion,
showing the promise of utilizing SimCVD as a general framework for downstream
tasks, such as medical image synthesis and registration.]]></summary>

black-box paradigms that impede interpretability. Therefore, it is critical to
establish computational trustworthy decision-making mechanisms enhanced by
interpretability-aware strategies. To this end, we propose a Trustworthy
Decision-Making (TDM) framework, which integrates symbolic planning into
sequential decision-making. The framework learns interpretable subtasks that
result in a complex, higher-level composite task that can be formally evaluated
using the proposed trust metric. TDM enables the subtask-level interpretability
by design and converges to an optimal symbolic plan from the learned subtasks.
Moreover, a TDM-based algorithm is introduced to demonstrate the unification of
symbolic planning with other sequential-decision making algorithms, reaping the
benefits of both. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of
trust-score-based planning while improving the interpretability of subtasks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A key challenge in scaling Gaussian Process (GP) regression to massive
datasets is that exact inference requires computation with a dense n x n kernel
matrix, where n is the number of data points. Significant work focuses on
approximating the kernel matrix via interpolation using a smaller set of m
inducing points. Structured kernel interpolation (SKI) is among the most
scalable methods: by placing inducing points on a dense grid and using
structured matrix algebra, SKI achieves per-iteration time of O(n + m log m)
for approximate inference. This linear scaling in n enables inference for very
large data sets; however the cost is per-iteration, which remains a limitation
for extremely large n. We show that the SKI per-iteration time can be reduced
to O(m log m) after a single O(n) time precomputation step by reframing SKI as
solving a natural Bayesian linear regression problem with a fixed set of m
compact basis functions. With per-iteration complexity independent of the
dataset size n for a fixed grid, our method scales to truly massive data sets.
We demonstrate speedups in practice for a wide range of m and n and apply the
method to GP inference on a three-dimensional weather radar dataset with over
100 million points.]]></summary>

become an area of active research in statistical machine learning, which has
found applications in natural and social sciences. Generally, a representation
of a network object is learned in a Euclidean geometry and is then used for
subsequent tasks regarding the nodes and/or edges of the network, such as
community detection, node classification and link prediction. Network embedding
algorithms have been proposed in multiple disciplines, often with
domain-specific notations and details. In addition, different measures and
tools have been adopted to evaluate and compare the methods proposed under
different settings, often dependent of the downstream tasks. As a result, it is
challenging to study these algorithms in the literature systematically.
Motivated by the recently proposed Veridical Data Science (VDS) framework, we
propose a framework for network embedding algorithms and discuss how the
principles of predictability, computability and stability apply in this
context. The utilization of this framework in network embedding holds the
potential to motivate and point to new directions for future research.]]></summary>

vulnerable to adversarial attacks on the graph structure. Although multiple
works have been proposed to improve their robustness against such structural
adversarial attacks, the reasons for the success of the attacks remain unclear.
In this work, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that structural
adversarial examples can be attributed to the non-robust aggregation scheme
(i.e., the weighted mean) of GCNs. Specifically, our analysis takes advantage
of the breakdown point which can quantitatively measure the robustness of
aggregation schemes. The key insight is that weighted mean, as the basic design
of GCNs, has a low breakdown point and its output can be dramatically changed
by injecting a single edge. We show that adopting the aggregation scheme with a
high breakdown point (e.g., median or trimmed mean) could significantly enhance
the robustness of GCNs against structural attacks. Extensive experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that such a simple but effective method
achieves the best robustness performance compared to state-of-the-art models.]]></summary>

as it mitigates the lack of pixel-wise annotations.

Given global image labels, WSL methods yield pixel-level predictions
(segmentations), which enable to interpret class predictions. Despite their
recent success, mostly with natural images, such methods can face important
challenges when the foreground and background regions have similar visual cues,
yielding high false-positive rates in segmentations, as is the case in
challenging histology images. WSL training is commonly driven by standard
classification losses, which implicitly maximize model confidence, and locate
the discriminative regions linked to classification decisions. Therefore, they
lack mechanisms for modeling explicitly non-discriminative regions and reducing
false-positive rates. We propose novel regularization terms, which enable the
model to seek both non-discriminative and discriminative regions, while
discouraging unbalanced segmentations. We introduce high uncertainty as a
criterion to localize non-discriminative regions that do not affect classifier
decision, and describe it with original Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence losses
evaluating the deviation of posterior predictions from the uniform
distribution. Our KL terms encourage high uncertainty of the model when the
latter inputs the latent non-discriminative regions. Our loss integrates: (i) a
cross-entropy seeking a foreground, where model confidence about class
prediction is high; (ii) a KL regularizer seeking a background, where model
uncertainty is high; and (iii) log-barrier terms discouraging unbalanced
segmentations. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies over the public
GlaS colon cancer data and a Camelyon16 patch-based benchmark for breast cancer
show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art WSL methods, and confirm
the effect of our new regularizers.]]></summary>

[7], we extend the inverse Cholesky factorization in [10] to deduce an
efficient inverse Cholesky factorization for a Hermitian matrix partitioned
into 2 * 2 blocks, which is utilized to develop the proposed BLS algorithm 1.
The proposed BLS algorithm 1 compute the ridge solution (i.e, the output
weights) from the inverse Cholesky factor of the Hermitian matrix in the ridge
inverse, and update the inverse Cholesky factor efficiently. From the proposed
BLS algorithm 1, we deduce the proposed ridge inverse, which can be obtained
from the generalized inverse in [7] by just change one matrix in the equation
to compute the newly added sub-matrix. We also modify the proposed algorithm 1
into the proposed algorithm 2, which is equivalent to the existing BLS
algorithm [7] in terms of numerical computations. The proposed algorithms 1 and
2 can reduce the computational complexity, since usually the Hermitian matrix
in the ridge inverse is smaller than the ridge inverse. With respect to the
existing BLS algorithm, the proposed algorithms 1 and 2 usually require about
13 and 2 3 of complexities, respectively, while in numerical experiments they
achieve the speedups (in each additional training time) of 2.40 - 2.91 and 1.36
- 1.60, respectively. Numerical experiments also show that the proposed
algorithm 1 and the standard ridge solution always bear the same testing
accuracy, and usually so do the proposed algorithm 2 and the existing BLS
algorithm. The existing BLS assumes the ridge parameter lamda->0, since it is
based on the generalized inverse with the ridge regression approximation. When
the assumption of lamda-> 0 is not satisfied, the standard ridge solution
obviously achieves a better testing accuracy than the existing BLS algorithm in
numerical experiments.]]></summary>

factor model called COMET (COnvolutional diMEnsion inTeraction), which
simultaneously model the high-order interaction patterns among historical
interactions and embedding dimensions. To be specific, COMET stacks the
embeddings of historical interactions horizontally at first, which results in
two "embedding maps". In this way, internal interactions and dimensional
interactions can be exploited by convolutional neural networks with kernels of
different sizes simultaneously. A fully-connected multi-layer perceptron is
then applied to obtain two interaction vectors. Lastly, the representations of
users and items are enriched by the learnt interaction vectors, which can
further be used to produce the final prediction. Extensive experiments and
ablation studies on various public implicit feedback datasets clearly
demonstrate the effectiveness and the rationality of our proposed method.]]></summary>

alone is insufficient to learn continually; the initial randomness enables only
initial learning but not continual learning. To the best of our knowledge, ours

address this issue, we propose an algorithm that continually injects random
features alongside gradient descent using a new generate-and-test process. We
call this the Continual Backprop algorithm. We show that, unlike Backprop,
Continual Backprop is able to continually adapt in both supervised and

common task when analyzing graphs. A very popular notion in subgraph analysis
is core decomposition. Recently, Esfahani et al. presented a probabilistic core
decomposition algorithm based on graph peeling and Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
that is capable of handling very large graphs. Their proposed peeling algorithm
(PA) starts from the lowest degree vertices and recursively deletes these
vertices, assigning core numbers, and updating the degree of neighbour vertices
until it reached the maximum core. However, in many applications, particularly
in biology, more valuable information can be obtained from dense
sub-communities and we are not interested in small cores where vertices do not
interact much with others. To make the previous PA focus more on dense
subgraphs, we propose a multi-stage graph peeling algorithm (M-PA) that has a
two-stage data screening procedure added before the previous PA. After removing
vertices from the graph based on the user-defined thresholds, we can reduce the
graph complexity largely and without affecting the vertices in subgraphs that
we are interested in. We show that M-PA is more efficient than the previous PA
and with the properly set filtering threshold, can produce very similar if not
identical dense subgraphs to the previous PA (in terms of graph density and

winning at each point in a game based on historical observations, are becoming
increasingly popular. In baseball, basketball and American football, they have
become important tools to enhance fan experience, to evaluate in-game
decision-making, and to inform coaching decisions. While equally relevant in
soccer, the adoption of these models is held back by technical challenges
arising from the low-scoring nature of the sport.

In this paper, we introduce an in-game win probability model for soccer that
addresses the shortcomings of existing models. First, we demonstrate that
in-game win probability models for other sports struggle to provide accurate
estimates for soccer, especially towards the end of a game. Second, we
introduce a novel Bayesian statistical framework that estimates running win,
tie and loss probabilities by leveraging a set of contextual game state
features. An empirical evaluation on eight seasons of data for the top-five

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Positive-Unlabelled (PU) learning is the machine learning setting in which
only a set of positive instances are labelled, while the rest of the data set
is unlabelled. The unlabelled instances may be either unspecified positive
samples or true negative samples. Over the years, many solutions have been
proposed to deal with PU learning. Some techniques consider the unlabelled
samples as negative ones, reducing the problem to a binary classification with
a noisy negative set, while others aim to detect sets of possible negative
examples to later apply a supervised machine learning strategy (two-step
techniques). The approach proposed in this work falls in the latter category
and works in a semi-supervised fashion: motivated and inspired by previous
works, a Markov diffusion process with restart is used to assign pseudo-labels
to unlabelled instances. Afterward, a machine learning model, exploiting the
newly assigned classes, is trained. The principal aim of the algorithm is to
identify a set of instances which are likely to contain positive instances that
were originally unlabelled.]]></summary>

high-dimensional time series data that lie on a low-dimensional manifold, as
arises for many processes. For an arbitrary manifold, there is no smooth global
coordinate representation, so following the formalism of differential topology
we represent the manifold as an atlas of charts. We first partition the data
into overlapping regions. Then undercomplete autoencoders are used to find
low-dimensional coordinate representations for each region. We then use the
data to learn dynamical models in each region, which together yield a global
low-dimensional dynamical model. We apply this method to examples ranging from
simple periodic dynamics to complex, nominally high-dimensional non-periodic
bursting dynamics of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. We demonstrate that it:
(1) can yield dynamical models of the lowest possible dimension, where previous
methods generally cannot; (2) exhibits computational benefits including
scalability, parallelizability, and adaptivity; and (3) separates state space
into regions of distinct behaviours.]]></summary>

This study investigates contrastive learning as a potential method to improve
existing MPA systems. Contrastive learning is a widely used technique in
representation learning to learn a structured latent space capable of
separately clustering multiple classes. It has been shown to produce state of
the art results for image-based classification problems. We introduce a
weighted contrastive loss suitable for regression tasks applied to a
convolutional neural network and show that contrastive loss results in
performance gains in regression tasks for MPA. Our results show that
contrastive-based methods are able to match and exceed SoTA performance for MPA
regression tasks by creating better class clusters within the latent space of

challenging due to the limited amount of labeled data available for training
neural network models. Moreover, Transformer-based architectures have proven to
beat state-of-the-art models in summarizing news data. In this paper, we
utilize a Transformer-based Pointer Generator Network to generate abstract
summaries for meeting transcripts. This model uses 2 LSTMs as an encoder and a
decoder, a Pointer network which copies words from the inputted text, and a
Generator network to produce out-of-vocabulary words (hence making the summary
abstractive). Moreover, a coverage mechanism is used to avoid repetition of
words in the generated summary. First, we show that training the model on a
news summary dataset and using zero-shot learning to test it on the meeting
dataset proves to produce better results than training it on the AMI meeting
dataset. Second, we show that training this model first on out-of-domain data,
such as the CNN-Dailymail dataset, followed by a fine-tuning stage on the AMI
meeting dataset is able to improve the performance of the model significantly.
We test our model on a testing set from the AMI dataset and report the ROUGE-2
score of the generated summary to compare with previous literature. We also
report the Factual score of our summaries since it is a better benchmark for
abstractive summaries since the ROUGE-2 score is limited to measuring
word-overlaps. We show that our improved model is able to improve on previous
models by at least 5 ROUGE-2 scores, which is a substantial improvement. Also,
a qualitative analysis of the summaries generated by our model shows that these
summaries and human-readable and indeed capture most of the important
information from the transcripts.]]></summary>

advertising, which is caused by the highly diversified feedback delay of a
conversion varying from a few minutes to several days. It is hard to design an
appropriate online learning system under these non-identical delay for
different types of ads and users. In this paper, we propose to tackle the
delayed feedback problem in online advertising by "Following the Prophet" (FTP
for short). The key insight is that, if the feedback came instantly for all the
logged samples, we could get a model without delayed feedback, namely the
"prophet". Although the prophet cannot be obtained during online learning, we
show that we could predict the prophet's predictions by an aggregation policy
on top of a set of multi-task predictions, where each task captures the
feedback patterns of different periods. We propose the objective and
optimization approach for the policy, and use the logged data to imitate the
prophet. Extensive experiments on three real-world advertising datasets show
that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art baselines.]]></summary>

dynamical systems are essential components of the universe. One key
characteristic of such systems is that certain physics laws -- represented as
ordinary/partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs) -- largely dominate the
whole process, irrespective of time or location. Physics-informed learning has
recently emerged to learn physics for accurate prediction, but they often lack
a mechanism to leverage localized spatial and temporal correlation or rely on
hard-coded physics parameters. In this paper, we advocate a physics-coupled
neural network model to learn parameters governing the physics of the system,
and further couple the learned physics to assist the learning of recurring
dynamics. A spatio-temporal physics-coupled neural network (ST-PCNN) model is
proposed to achieve three goals: (1) learning the underlying physics
parameters, (2) transition of local information between spatio-temporal
regions, and (3) forecasting future values for the dynamical system. The
physics-coupled learning ensures that the proposed model can be tremendously
improved by using learned physics parameters, and can achieve good long-range
forecasting (e.g., more than 30-steps). Experiments, using simulated and
field-collected ocean current data, validate that ST-PCNN outperforms existing
physics-informed models.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Collaborative filtering (CF) is a long-standing problem of recommender
systems. Many novel methods have been proposed, ranging from classical matrix
factorization to recent graph convolutional network-based approaches. After
recent fierce debates, researchers started to focus on linear graph
convolutional networks (GCNs) with a layer combination, which show
state-of-the-art accuracy in many datasets. In this work, we extend them based
on neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), because the linear GCN
concept can be interpreted as a differential equation, and present the method
of Learnable-Time ODE-based Collaborative Filtering (LT-OCF). The main novelty
in our method is that after redesigning linear GCNs on top of the NODE regime,
i) we learn the optimal architecture rather than relying on manually designed
ones, ii) we learn smooth ODE solutions that are considered suitable for CF,
and iii) we test with various ODE solvers that internally build a diverse set
of neural network connections. We also present a novel training method
specialized to our method. In our experiments with three benchmark datasets,
Gowalla, Yelp2018, and Amazon-Book, our method consistently shows better
accuracy than existing methods, e.g., a recall of 0.0411 by LightGCN vs. 0.0442
by LT-OCF and an NDCG of 0.0315 by LightGCN vs. 0.0341 by LT-OCF in
Amazon-Book. One more important discovery in our experiments that is worth
mentioning is that our best accuracy was achieved by dense connections rather
than linear connections.]]></summary>

suitable for computationally expensive simulation-based applications and
guarantees statistical convergence to the global optimum. While remaining as
one of the most popular optimization methods, its capability is hindered by the
size of data, the dimensionality of the considered problem, and the nature of
sequential optimization. These scalability issues are intertwined with each
other and must be tackled simultaneously. In this work, we propose the
Scalable$^3$-BO framework, which employs sparse GP as the underlying surrogate
model to scope with Big Data and is equipped with a random embedding to
efficiently optimize high-dimensional problems with low effective
dimensionality. The Scalable$^3$-BO framework is further leveraged with
asynchronous parallelization feature, which fully exploits the computational
resource on HPC within a computational budget. As a result, the proposed
Scalable$^3$-BO framework is scalable in three independent perspectives: with
respect to data size, dimensionality, and computational resource on HPC. The
goal of this work is to push the frontiers of BO beyond its well-known
scalability issues and minimize the wall-clock waiting time for optimizing
high-dimensional computationally expensive applications. We demonstrate the
capability of Scalable$^3$-BO with 1 million data points, 10,000-dimensional

resistivity values. A commercial simulator provided by a tool vendor is used to
generate a training dataset. The dataset size is limited because the simulator
provided by the vendor is optimized for sequential execution. Therefore, we
design a training dataset that embraces the geological rules and geosteering
specifics supported by the forward model. We use this dataset to produce an EM
simulator based on a DNN without access to the proprietary information about
the EM tool configuration or the original simulator source code. Despite
employing a relatively small training set size, the resulting DNN forward model
is quite accurate for the considered examples: a multi-layer synthetic case and
a section of a published historical operation from the Goliat Field. The
observed average evaluation time of 0.15 ms per logging position makes it also
suitable for future use as part of evaluation-hungry statistical and/or
Monte-Carlo inversion algorithms within geosteering workflows.]]></summary>

effectiveness, not just when applied for re-ranking the output of classical
weighting models such as BM25, but also when used directly for passage indexing
and retrieval, a technique which is called dense retrieval. In the existing
literature in neural ranking, two dense retrieval families have become
apparent: single representation, where entire passages are represented by a
single embedding (usually BERT's [CLS] token, as exemplified by the recent ANCE
approach), or multiple representations, where each token in a passage is
represented by its own embedding (as exemplified by the recent ColBERT
approach). These two families have not been directly compared. However, because
of the likely importance of dense retrieval moving forward, a clear
understanding of their advantages and disadvantages is paramount. To this end,
this paper contributes a direct study on their comparative effectiveness,
noting situations where each method under/over performs w.r.t. each other, and
w.r.t. a BM25 baseline. We observe that, while ANCE is more efficient than
ColBERT in terms of response time and memory usage, multiple representations
are statistically more effective than the single representations for MAP and
MRR@10. We also show that multiple representations obtain better improvements
than single representations for queries that are the hardest for BM25, as well
as for definitional queries, and those with complex information needs.]]></summary>

rotating shaft to simulate the vibration signature of faults like cracks in
different components aiming towards simulated data-driven machine learning. We
have employed lumped and one-dimensional analytical models of the subcomponents
for better insight into the complex dynamic response. The framework seeks to
address some of the challenges encountered in analyzing and optimizing fault
detection and identification schemes for health monitoring of rotating
turbomachinery, including aero-engines. We model the bladed disks and shafts by
combining lumped elements and one-dimensional finite elements, leading to a
coupled system. The simulation results are in good agreement with previously
published data. We model the cracks in a blade analytically with their
effective reduced stiffness approximation. Multiple types of faults are
modeled, including cracks in the blades of single and two-stage bladed disks,
Fan Blade Off (FBO), and Foreign Object Damage (FOD). We have applied
aero-engine operational loading conditions to simulate realistic scenarios of
online health monitoring. The proposed reduced-order simulation framework will
have applications in probabilistic signal modeling, machine learning toward
fault signature identification, and parameter estimation with measured

autoregressive language models (GPT, GPT-2, GPT-3) on a huge amount of
unlabeled text corpus for text generation. Despite showing great results, this
generates two training efficiency challenges. First, training large corpora can
be extremely timing consuming, and how to present training samples to the model
to improve the token-wise convergence speed remains a challenging and open
question. Second, many of these large models have to be trained with hundreds
or even thousands of processors using data-parallelism with a very large batch
size. Despite of its better compute efficiency, it has been observed that
large-batch training often runs into training instability issue or converges to
solutions with bad generalization performance. To overcome these two
challenges, we present a study of a curriculum learning based approach, which
helps improves the pre-training convergence speed of autoregressive models.
More importantly, we find that curriculum learning, as a regularization method,
exerts a gradient variance reduction effect and enables to train autoregressive
models with much larger batch sizes and learning rates without training
instability, further improving the training speed. Our evaluations demonstrate
that curriculum learning enables training GPT-2 models (with up to 1.5B
parameters) with 8x larger batch size and 4x larger learning rate, whereas the
baseline approach struggles with training divergence. To achieve the same
validation perplexity targets during pre-training, curriculum learning reduces
the required number of tokens and wall clock time by up to 59% and 54%,
respectively. To achieve the same or better zero-shot WikiText-103/LAMBADA
evaluation results at the end of pre-training, curriculum learning reduces the
required number of tokens and wall clock time by up to 13% and 61%,
respectively.]]></summary>

interest goes out to the relationships among documents and terms: for example,
what terms are more often used in what documents. However, the LSA solution
displays a mix of marginal effects and these relationships. It appears that CA
has more attractive properties than LSA. One such property is that, in CA, the
effect of the margins is effectively eliminated, so that the CA solution is
optimally suited to focus on the relationships among documents and terms. Three

utilized to assist recommendation. Through textual reviews, a user explicitly
express her affinity towards the item. Previous researchers found that by using
the information extracted from these reviews, we can better profile the users'
explicit preferences as well as the item features, leading to the improvement
of recommendation performance. However, most of the previous algorithms were
only utilizing the review information for explicit-feedback problem i.e. rating
prediction, and when it comes to implicit-feedback ranking problem such as
top-N recommendation, the usage of review information has not been fully
explored. Seeing this gap, in this work, we investigate the effectiveness of
textual review information for top-N recommendation under E-commerce settings.
We adapt several SOTA review-based rating prediction models for top-N
recommendation tasks and compare them to existing top-N recommendation models
from both performance and efficiency. We find that models utilizing only review
information can not achieve better performances than vanilla implicit-feedback
matrix factorization method. When utilizing review information as a regularizer

factorization method can be further improved. However, the optimal model
structure to utilize textual reviews for E-commerce top-N recommendation is yet

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Collaborative filtering (CF) is a long-standing problem of recommender
systems. Many novel methods have been proposed, ranging from classical matrix
factorization to recent graph convolutional network-based approaches. After
recent fierce debates, researchers started to focus on linear graph
convolutional networks (GCNs) with a layer combination, which show
state-of-the-art accuracy in many datasets. In this work, we extend them based
on neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), because the linear GCN
concept can be interpreted as a differential equation, and present the method
of Learnable-Time ODE-based Collaborative Filtering (LT-OCF). The main novelty
in our method is that after redesigning linear GCNs on top of the NODE regime,
i) we learn the optimal architecture rather than relying on manually designed
ones, ii) we learn smooth ODE solutions that are considered suitable for CF,
and iii) we test with various ODE solvers that internally build a diverse set
of neural network connections. We also present a novel training method
specialized to our method. In our experiments with three benchmark datasets,
Gowalla, Yelp2018, and Amazon-Book, our method consistently shows better
accuracy than existing methods, e.g., a recall of 0.0411 by LightGCN vs. 0.0442
by LT-OCF and an NDCG of 0.0315 by LightGCN vs. 0.0341 by LT-OCF in
Amazon-Book. One more important discovery in our experiments that is worth
mentioning is that our best accuracy was achieved by dense connections rather
than linear connections.]]></summary>

simultaneously model the high-order interaction patterns among historical

embeddings of historical interactions horizontally at first, which results in
two "embedding maps". In this way, internal interactions and dimensional
interactions can be exploited by convolutional neural networks with kernels of
different sizes simultaneously. A fully-connected multi-layer perceptron is
then applied to obtain two interaction vectors. Lastly, the representations of
users and items are enriched by the learnt interaction vectors, which can
further be used to produce the final prediction. Extensive experiments and

and complexity of machine learning tasks. Various tools and techniques are
available that assess data quality with respect to general cleaning and
profiling checks. However these techniques are not applicable to detect data
issues in the context of machine learning tasks, like noisy labels, existence
of overlapping classes etc. We attempt to re-look at the data quality issues in
the context of building a machine learning pipeline and build a tool that can
detect, explain and remediate issues in the data, and systematically and
automatically capture all the changes applied to the data. We introduce the
Data Quality Toolkit for machine learning as a library of some key quality
metrics and relevant remediation techniques to analyze and enhance the
readiness of structured training datasets for machine learning projects. The
toolkit can reduce the turn-around times of data preparation pipelines and
streamline the data quality assessment process. Our toolkit is publicly
available via IBM API Hub [1] platform, any developer can assess the data
quality using the IBM's Data Quality for AI apis [2]. Detailed tutorials are
also available on IBM Learning Path [3].]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Question generation (QG) is a natural language generation task where a model
is trained to ask questions corresponding to some input text. Most recent
approaches frame QG as a sequence-to-sequence problem and rely on additional
features and mechanisms to increase performance; however, these often increase
model complexity, and can rely on auxiliary data unavailable in practical use.
A single Transformer-based unidirectional language model leveraging transfer
learning can be used to produce high quality questions while disposing of
additional task-specific complexity. Our QG model, finetuned from GPT-2 Small,
outperforms several paragraph-level QG baselines on the SQuAD dataset by 0.95
METEOR points. Human evaluators rated questions as easy to answer, relevant to
their context paragraph, and corresponding well to natural human speech. Also
introduced is a new set of baseline scores on the RACE dataset, which has not
previously been used for QG tasks. Further experimentation with varying model
capacities and datasets with non-identification type questions is recommended
in order to further verify the robustness of pretrained Transformer-based LMs
as question generators.]]></summary>

singular value decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction. In this
article, LSA and CA are compared from a theoretical point of view and applied
in both a toy example and an authorship attribution example. In text mining
interest goes out to the relationships among documents and terms: for example,
what terms are more often used in what documents. However, the LSA solution
displays a mix of marginal effects and these relationships. It appears that CA
has more attractive properties than LSA. One such property is that, in CA, the
effect of the margins is effectively eliminated, so that the CA solution is
optimally suited to focus on the relationships among documents and terms. Three
mechanisms are distinguished to weight documents and terms, and a unifying
framework is proposed that includes these three mechanisms and includes both CA
and LSA as special cases. In the authorship attribution example, the national
anthem of the Netherlands, the application of the discussed methods is

and weak baselines. We explore data augmentation on hard tasks (i.e., few-shot
natural language understanding) and strong baselines (i.e., pretrained models
with over one billion parameters). Under this setting, we reproduced a large
number of previous augmentation methods and found that these methods bring
marginal gains at best and sometimes degrade the performance much. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel data augmentation method FlipDA that jointly
uses a generative model and a classifier to generate label-flipped data.
Central to the idea of FlipDA is the discovery that generating label-flipped
data is more crucial to the performance than generating label-preserved data.
Experiments show that FlipDA achieves a good tradeoff between effectiveness and
robustness---it substantially improves many tasks while not negatively
affecting the others.]]></summary>

Adversarial VQA, a new large-scale VQA benchmark, collected iteratively via an

we discover several interesting findings. (i) Surprisingly, we find that during

successfully. (ii) Both large-scale pre-trained models and adversarial training
methods achieve far worse performance on the new benchmark than over standard
VQA v2 dataset, revealing the fragility of these models while demonstrating the
effectiveness of our adversarial dataset. (iii) When used for data

evolve with respect to time. For example, the U.S. President might change every
four years. Therefore, it is important to consider the time dimension and
empower the existing QA models to reason over time. However, the existing QA
datasets contain rather few time-sensitive questions, hence not suitable for
diagnosing or benchmarking the model's temporal reasoning capability. In order
to promote research in this direction, we propose to construct a time-sensitive
QA dataset. The dataset is constructed by 1) mining time-evolving facts from
WikiData and align them to their corresponding Wikipedia page, 2) employing
crowd workers to verify and calibrate these noisy facts, 3) generating
question-answer pairs based on the annotated time-sensitive facts. Our dataset
poses two novel challenges: 1) the model needs to understand both explicit and
implicit mention of time information in the long document, 2) the model needs
to perform temporal reasoning like comparison, addition, subtraction. We
evaluate different SoTA long-document QA systems like BigBird and FiD on our
dataset. The best-performing model FiD can only achieve 46\% accuracy, still
far behind the human performance of 87\%. We demonstrate that these models are
still lacking the ability to perform robust temporal understanding and
reasoning. Therefore, we believe that our dataset could serve as a benchmark to
empower future studies in temporal reasoning. The dataset and code are released

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Creating abstractive summaries from meeting transcripts has proven to be
challenging due to the limited amount of labeled data available for training
neural network models. Moreover, Transformer-based architectures have proven to
beat state-of-the-art models in summarizing news data. In this paper, we
utilize a Transformer-based Pointer Generator Network to generate abstract
summaries for meeting transcripts. This model uses 2 LSTMs as an encoder and a
decoder, a Pointer network which copies words from the inputted text, and a
Generator network to produce out-of-vocabulary words (hence making the summary
abstractive). Moreover, a coverage mechanism is used to avoid repetition of
words in the generated summary. First, we show that training the model on a
news summary dataset and using zero-shot learning to test it on the meeting
dataset proves to produce better results than training it on the AMI meeting
dataset. Second, we show that training this model first on out-of-domain data,
such as the CNN-Dailymail dataset, followed by a fine-tuning stage on the AMI
meeting dataset is able to improve the performance of the model significantly.
We test our model on a testing set from the AMI dataset and report the ROUGE-2
score of the generated summary to compare with previous literature. We also
report the Factual score of our summaries since it is a better benchmark for
abstractive summaries since the ROUGE-2 score is limited to measuring
word-overlaps. We show that our improved model is able to improve on previous
models by at least 5 ROUGE-2 scores, which is a substantial improvement. Also,
a qualitative analysis of the summaries generated by our model shows that these
summaries and human-readable and indeed capture most of the important
information from the transcripts.]]></summary>

increases the interest in Explainable and Interpretable Machine Learning
(XI-ML). This trend can be seen both in the increasing number of regulations
and strategies for developing trustworthy AI and the growing number of
scientific papers dedicated to this topic. To ensure the sustainable
development of AI, it is essential to understand the dynamics of the impact of
regulation on research papers as well as the impact of scientific discourse on
AI-related policies. This paper introduces a novel framework for joint analysis
of AI-related policy documents and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
research papers. The collected documents are enriched with metadata and
interconnections, using various NLP methods combined with a methodology
inspired by Institutional Grammar. Based on the information extracted from
collected documents, we showcase a series of analyses that help understand
interactions, similarities, and differences between documents at different
stages of institutionalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to use automatic language analysis tools to understand the dynamics
between XI-ML methods and regulations. We believe that such a system
contributes to better cooperation between XAI researchers and AI policymakers.]]></summary>

considerations dictate the move of digital assistants on the device. Giving a

that it fits on the user's device. We demonstrate that low parameter models can
simultaneously retain their general knowledge conversational abilities while
improving in a specific domain. Additionally, we propose a generic framework
that accounts for variety in question types, tracks reference throughout
multi-turn conversations, and removes inconsistent and potentially toxic
responses. Our framework seamlessly transitions between chatting and performing
transactional tasks, which will ultimately make interactions with digital
assistants more human-like. We evaluate our framework on 1 internal and 4

with model predictions. However, as of today, this comparison is mostly
lexical-based and therefore misses out on answers that have no lexical overlap
but are still semantically similar, thus treating correct answers as false.
This underestimation of the true performance of models hinders user acceptance
in applications and complicates a fair comparison of different models.
Therefore, there is a need for an evaluation metric that is based on semantics
instead of pure string similarity. In this short paper, we present SAS, a
cross-encoder-based metric for the estimation of semantic answer similarity,
and compare it to seven existing metrics. To this end, we create an English and
a German three-way annotated evaluation dataset containing pairs of answers
along with human judgment of their semantic similarity, which we release along
with an implementation of the SAS metric and the experiments. We find that
semantic similarity metrics based on recent transformer models correlate much
better with human judgment than traditional lexical similarity metrics on our

to enhance the effectiveness in information retrieval. Recently, with the rapid

promising success in many natural language tasks. To leverage the strength of
text generation for information retrieval, in this article, we propose a novel
approach which effectively integrates text generation models into PRF-based
query expansion. In particular, our approach generates augmented query terms
via neural text generation models conditioned on both the initial query and
pseudo-relevance feedback. Moreover, in order to train the generative model, we
adopt the conditional generative adversarial nets (CGANs) and propose the
PRF-CGAN method in which both the generator and the discriminator are
conditioned on the pseudo-relevance feedback. We evaluate the performance of
our approach on information retrieval tasks using two benchmark datasets. The
experimental results show that our approach achieves comparable performance or
outperforms traditional query expansion methods on both the retrieval and

effectiveness, not just when applied for re-ranking the output of classical
weighting models such as BM25, but also when used directly for passage indexing
and retrieval, a technique which is called dense retrieval. In the existing
literature in neural ranking, two dense retrieval families have become
apparent: single representation, where entire passages are represented by a
single embedding (usually BERT's [CLS] token, as exemplified by the recent ANCE
approach), or multiple representations, where each token in a passage is
represented by its own embedding (as exemplified by the recent ColBERT
approach). These two families have not been directly compared. However, because
of the likely importance of dense retrieval moving forward, a clear
understanding of their advantages and disadvantages is paramount. To this end,
this paper contributes a direct study on their comparative effectiveness,
noting situations where each method under/over performs w.r.t. each other, and
w.r.t. a BM25 baseline. We observe that, while ANCE is more efficient than
ColBERT in terms of response time and memory usage, multiple representations
are statistically more effective than the single representations for MAP and
MRR@10. We also show that multiple representations obtain better improvements
than single representations for queries that are the hardest for BM25, as well
as for definitional queries, and those with complex information needs.]]></summary>

contrastive losses and evaluate its performance by the downstream tasks of
video action recognition, audio event classification, image classification, and
text-to-video retrieval. Furthermore, we study a modality-agnostic
single-backbone Transformer by sharing weights among the three modalities. We
show that the convolution-free VATT outperforms state-of-the-art ConvNet-based
architectures in the downstream tasks. Especially, VATT's vision Transformer
achieves the top-1 accuracy of 82.1% on Kinetics-400, 83.6% on Kinetics-600,and
41.1% on Moments in Time, new records while avoiding supervised pre-training.
Transferring to image classification leads to 78.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet
compared to 64.7% by training the same Transformer from scratch, showing the
generalizability of our model despite the domain gap between videos and images.
VATT's audio Transformer also sets a new record on waveform-based audio event

of aspect terms, their associated sentiments, and the opinion terms that
provide evidence for the expressed sentiments. Previous approaches to ASTE
usually simultaneously extract all three components or first identify the
aspect and opinion terms, then pair them up to predict their sentiment
polarities. In this work, we present a novel paradigm, ASTE-RL, by regarding
the aspect and opinion terms as arguments of the expressed sentiment in a
hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) framework. We first focus on
sentiments expressed in a sentence, then identify the target aspect and opinion
terms for that sentiment. This takes into account the mutual interactions among
the triplet's components while improving exploration and sample efficiency.
Furthermore, this hierarchical RLsetup enables us to deal with multiple and
overlapping triplets. In our experiments, we evaluate our model on existing
datasets from laptop and restaurant domains and show that it achieves
state-of-the-art performance. The implementation of this work is publicly

singular value decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction. In this
article, LSA and CA are compared from a theoretical point of view and applied
in both a toy example and an authorship attribution example. In text mining
interest goes out to the relationships among documents and terms: for example,
what terms are more often used in what documents. However, the LSA solution
displays a mix of marginal effects and these relationships. It appears that CA
has more attractive properties than LSA. One such property is that, in CA, the
effect of the margins is effectively eliminated, so that the CA solution is
optimally suited to focus on the relationships among documents and terms. Three
mechanisms are distinguished to weight documents and terms, and a unifying
framework is proposed that includes these three mechanisms and includes both CA
and LSA as special cases. In the authorship attribution example, the national
anthem of the Netherlands, the application of the discussed methods is
illustrated.]]></summary>

with model predictions. However, as of today, this comparison is mostly
lexical-based and therefore misses out on answers that have no lexical overlap
but are still semantically similar, thus treating correct answers as false.
This underestimation of the true performance of models hinders user acceptance
in applications and complicates a fair comparison of different models.
Therefore, there is a need for an evaluation metric that is based on semantics
instead of pure string similarity. In this short paper, we present SAS, a
cross-encoder-based metric for the estimation of semantic answer similarity,
and compare it to seven existing metrics. To this end, we create an English and
a German three-way annotated evaluation dataset containing pairs of answers
along with human judgment of their semantic similarity, which we release along
with an implementation of the SAS metric and the experiments. We find that
semantic similarity metrics based on recent transformer models correlate much
better with human judgment than traditional lexical similarity metrics on our
two newly created datasets and one dataset from related work.]]></summary>

three major technical contributions by introducing formal formulations of the
two kinds of similarity relations, generating high-quality pseudo labeled data

ones. Methods based on the relational path in the literature have shown strong,
interpretable, and inductive reasoning ability. However, the paths are
naturally limited in capturing complex topology in KG. In this paper, we
introduce a novel relational structure, i.e., relational directed graph
(r-digraph), which is composed of overlapped relational paths, to capture the
KG's structural information. Since the digraph exhibits more complex structure
than paths, constructing and learning on the r-digraph are challenging. Here,
we propose a variant of graph neural network, i.e., RED-GNN, to address the
above challenges by learning the RElational Digraph with a variant of GNN.
Specifically, RED-GNN recursively encodes multiple r-digraphs with shared edges
and selects the strongly correlated edges through query-dependent attention
weights. We demonstrate the significant gains on reasoning both KG with unseen
entities and incompletion KG benchmarks by the r-digraph, the efficiency of
RED-GNN, and the interpretable dependencies learned on the r-digraph.]]></summary>

emerging as the next-generation displays for augmented and virtual reality, and
automotive heads-up displays. One of the critical problems harming the wide
adoption of such displays is the presence of speckle noise inherent to
holography, that compromises its quality by introducing perceptible artifacts.
Although speckle noise suppression has been an active research area, the
previous works have not considered the perceptual characteristics of the Human
Visual System (HVS), which receives the final displayed imagery. However, it is
well studied that the sensitivity of the HVS is not uniform across the visual
field, which has led to gaze-contingent rendering schemes for maximizing the
perceptual quality in various computer-generated imagery. Inspired by this, we
present the first method that reduces the "perceived speckle noise" by
integrating foveal and peripheral vision characteristics of the HVS, along with
the retinal point spread function, into the phase hologram computation.
Specifically, we introduce the anatomical and statistical retinal receptor
distribution into our computational hologram optimization, which places a
higher priority on reducing the perceived foveal speckle noise while being
adaptable to any individual's optical aberration on the retina. Our method
demonstrates superior perceptual quality on our emulated holographic display.
Our evaluations with objective measurements and subjective studies demonstrate
a significant reduction of the human perceived noise.]]></summary>

degradation at extremely low computational cost (e.g. 5M FLOPs on ImageNet
classification). We found that two factors, sparse connectivity and dynamic
activation function, are effective to improve the accuracy. The former avoids
the significant reduction of network width, while the latter mitigates the
detriment of reduction in network depth. Technically, we propose
micro-factorized convolution, which factorizes a convolution matrix into low
rank matrices, to integrate sparse connectivity into convolution. We also
present a new dynamic activation function, named Dynamic Shift Max, to improve
the non-linearity via maxing out multiple dynamic fusions between an input
feature map and its circular channel shift. Building upon these two new
operators, we arrive at a family of networks, named MicroNet, that achieves
significant performance gains over the state of the art in the low FLOP regime.
For instance, under the constraint of 12M FLOPs, MicroNet achieves 59.4\% top-1
accuracy on ImageNet classification, outperforming MobileNetV3 by 9.6\%. Source

learning projects. Similar to lean startups and lean manufacturing, we argue
that lean machine learning (LeanML) can drastically slash avoidable wastes in
commercial machine learning projects, reduce the business risk in investing in
machine learning capabilities and, in so doing, further democratize access to
machine learning. The lean design pattern we propose in this paper is based on
two realizations. First, it is possible to estimate the best performance one
may achieve when predicting an outcome $y \in \mathcal{Y}$ using a given set of
explanatory variables $x \in \mathcal{X}$, for a wide range of performance
metrics, and without training any predictive model. Second, doing so is
considerably easier, faster, and cheaper than learning the best predictive
model. We derive formulae expressing the best $R^2$, MSE, classification
accuracy, and log-likelihood per observation achievable when using $x$ to
predict $y$ as a function of the mutual information $I\left(y; x\right)$, and
possibly a measure of the variability of $y$ (e.g. its Shannon entropy in the
case of classification accuracy, and its variance in the case regression MSE).
We illustrate the efficacy of the LeanML design pattern on a wide range of
regression and classification problems, synthetic and real-life.]]></summary>

have turned to algorithmic decision-making to achieve greater fairness in
society. As these efforts intensify, reasoning within the burgeoning field of
"algorithmic fairness" increasingly shapes how fairness manifests in practice.
This paper interrogates whether algorithmic fairness provides the appropriate
conceptual and practical tools for enhancing social equality. I argue that the
dominant, "formal" approach to algorithmic fairness is ill-equipped as a
framework for pursuing equality, as its narrow frame of analysis generates
restrictive approaches to reform. In light of these shortcomings, I propose an
alternative: a "substantive" approach to algorithmic fairness that centers
opposition to social hierarchies and provides a more expansive analysis of how
to address inequality. This substantive approach enables more fruitful
theorizing about the role of algorithms in combatting oppression. The
distinction between formal and substantive algorithmic fairness is exemplified
by each approach's responses to the "impossibility of fairness" (an
incompatibility between mathematical definitions of algorithmic fairness).
While the formal approach requires us to accept the "impossibility of fairness"
as a harsh limit on efforts to enhance equality, the substantive approach
allows us to escape the "impossibility of fairness" by suggesting reforms that
are not subject to this false dilemma and that are better equipped to
ameliorate conditions of social oppression.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiplex networks have become increasingly more prevalent in many fields,
and have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling the complexity of real
networks. There is a critical need for developing inference models for
multiplex networks that can take into account potential dependencies across
different layers, particularly when the aim is community detection. We add to a
limited literature by proposing a novel and efficient Bayesian model for
community detection in multiplex networks. A key feature of our approach is the
ability to model varying communities at different network layers. In contrast,
many existing models assume the same communities for all layers. Moreover, our
model automatically picks up the necessary number of communities at each layer
(as validated by real data examples). This is appealing, since deciding the
number of communities is a challenging aspect of community detection, and
especially so in the multiplex setting, if one allows the communities to change
across layers. Borrowing ideas from hierarchical Bayesian modeling, we use a
hierarchical Dirichlet prior to model community labels across layers, allowing
dependency in their structure. Given the community labels, a stochastic block
model (SBM) is assumed for each layer. We develop an efficient slice sampler
for sampling the posterior distribution of the community labels as well as the
link probabilities between communities. In doing so, we address some unique
challenges posed by coupling the complex likelihood of SBM with the
hierarchical nature of the prior on the labels. An extensive empirical
validation is performed on simulated and real data, demonstrating the superior
performance of the model over single-layer alternatives, as well as the ability
to uncover interesting structures in real networks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anomaly detection methods require high-quality features. In recent years, the
anomaly detection community has attempted to obtain better features using
advances in deep self-supervised feature learning. Surprisingly, a very
promising direction, using pretrained deep features, has been mostly
overlooked. In this paper, we first empirically establish the perhaps expected,
but unreported result, that combining pretrained features with simple anomaly
detection and segmentation methods convincingly outperforms, much more complex,
state-of-the-art methods.

In order to obtain further performance gains in anomaly detection, we adapt
pretrained features to the target distribution. Although transfer learning
methods are well established in multi-class classification problems, the
one-class classification (OCC) setting is not as well explored. It turns out
that naive adaptation methods, which typically work well in supervised
learning, often result in catastrophic collapse (feature deterioration) and
reduce performance in OCC settings. A popular OCC method, DeepSVDD, advocates
using specialized architectures, but this limits the adaptation performance
gain. We propose two methods for combating collapse: i) a variant of early
stopping that dynamically learns the stopping iteration ii) elastic
regularization inspired by continual learning. Our method, PANDA, outperforms
the state-of-the-art in the OCC, outlier exposure and anomaly segmentation
settings by large margins.]]></summary>

model parameters directly from depth images without the need to know
articulation model categories a priori. By contrast, existing methods that
learn articulation models from raw observations typically only predict point
estimates of the model parameters, which are insufficient to guarantee the safe
manipulation of articulated objects. Our core contributions include a novel
representation for distributions over rigid body transformations and
articulation model parameters based on screw theory, von Mises-Fisher
distributions, and Stiefel manifolds. Combining these concepts allows for an
efficient, mathematically sound representation that implicitly satisfies the
constraints that rigid body transformations and articulations must adhere to.
Leveraging this representation, we introduce a novel deep learning based
approach, DUST-net, that performs category-independent articulation model
estimation while also providing model uncertainties. We evaluate our approach
on several benchmarking datasets and real-world objects and compare its
performance with two current state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate
that DUST-net can successfully learn distributions over articulation models for
novel objects across articulation model categories, which generate point

privacy and computation challenges. FL ensures no data leaves its source as the
model is trained at where the data resides. However, FL comes with its own set
of challenges. The communication of model weight updates in this distributed
environment comes with significant network bandwidth costs. In this context, we
propose a mechanism of compressing the weight updates using Autoencoders (AE),
which learn the data features of the weight updates and subsequently perform
compression. The encoder is set up on each of the nodes where the training is
performed while the decoder is set up on the node where the weights are
aggregated. This setup achieves compression through the encoder and recreates
the weights at the end of every communication round using the decoder. This
paper shows that the dynamic and orthogonal AE based weight compression
technique could serve as an advantageous alternative (or an add-on) in a large
scale FL, as it not only achieves compression ratios ranging from 500x to 1720x
and beyond, but can also be modified based on the accuracy requirements,
computational capacity, and other requirements of the given FL setup.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We propose RIFE, a Real-time Intermediate Flow Estimation algorithm for Video
Frame Interpolation (VFI). Many recent flow-based VFI methods first estimate
the bi-directional optical flows, then scale and reverse them to approximate
intermediate flows, leading to artifacts on motion boundaries. RIFE uses a
neural network named IFNet that can directly estimate the intermediate flows
from coarse-to-fine with much better speed. We design a privileged distillation
scheme for training intermediate flow model, which leads to a large performance
improvement. Experiments demonstrate that RIFE is flexible and can achieve
state-of-the-art performance on several public benchmarks. The code is

trade-off between exploiting partial knowledge of a user's preferences for
short-term satisfaction and exploring additional user preferences for long-term
coverage. Although exploration is indispensable for long success of a
recommender system, the exploration has been considered as the risk to decrease
user satisfaction. The reason for the risk is that items chosen for exploration
frequently mismatch with the user's interests. To mitigate this risk,
recommender systems have mixed items chosen for exploration into a
recommendation list, disguising the items as recommendations to elicit feedback
on the items to discover the user's additional tastes. This mix-in approach has
been widely used in many recommenders, but there is rare research, evaluating
the effectiveness of the mix-in approach or proposing a new approach for
eliciting user feedback without deceiving users. In this work, we aim to
propose a new approach for feedback elicitation without any deception and
compare our approach to the conventional mix-in approach for evaluation. To
this end, we designed a recommender interface that reveals which items are for
exploration and conducted a within-subject study with 94 MTurk workers. Our
results indicated that users left significantly more feedback on items chosen
for exploration with our interface. Besides, users evaluated that our new
interface is better than the conventional mix-in interface in terms of novelty,
diversity, transparency, trust, and satisfaction. Finally, path analysis show
that, in only our new interface, exploration caused to increase user-centric
evaluation metrics. Our work paves the way for how to design an interface,
which utilizes learning algorithm based on users' feedback signals, giving
better user experience and gathering more feedback data.]]></summary>

deploying vehicles in road testing to obtain inputs that cause problematic

also challenges the foundation of testing using equivalence classes and the
associated relative test coverage criterion. In this paper, we propose believed
equivalence, where the establishment of an equivalence class is initially based
on expert belief and is subject to a set of available test cases having a
consistent valuation. Upon a newly encountered test case that breaks the
consistency, one may need to refine the established categorization in order to
split the originally believed equivalence into two. Finally, we focus on
modules implemented using deep neural networks where every category partitions
an input over the real domain. We present both analytical and lazy methods to
suggest the refinement. The concept is demonstrated in analyzing multiple

gesture properties (phase) on the other hand can be predicted from either

of neural networks. However, most existing neural recommendation systems
initialize the user and item embeddings randomly. In this work, we propose a
new initialization scheme for user and item embeddings called Laplacian
Eigenmaps with Popularity-based Regularization for Isolated Data (LEPORID).
LEPORID endows the embeddings with information regarding multi-scale
neighborhood structures on the data manifold and performs adaptive
regularization to compensate for high embedding variance on the tail of the
data distribution. Exploiting matrix sparsity, LEPORID embeddings can be
computed efficiently. We evaluate LEPORID in a wide range of neural
recommendation models. In contrast to the recent surprising finding that the
simple K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) method often outperforms neural recommendation
systems, we show that existing neural systems initialized with LEPORID often
perform on par or better than KNN. To maximize the effects of the
initialization, we propose the Dual-Loss Residual Recommendation (DLR2)

reinforcement learning, there remains a fundamental lack of understanding in
designing controllers that provide robustness to inherent non-asymptotic
uncertainties arising from models estimated with finite, noisy data. We propose
a robust adaptive control algorithm that explicitly incorporates such
non-asymptotic uncertainties into the control design. The algorithm has three
components: (1) a least-squares nominal model estimator; (2) a bootstrap
resampling method that quantifies non-asymptotic variance of the nominal model
estimate; and (3) a non-conventional robust control design method using an
optimal linear quadratic regulator (LQR) with multiplicative noise. A key
advantage of the proposed approach is that the system identification and robust
control design procedures both use stochastic uncertainty representations, so
that the actual inherent statistical estimation uncertainty directly aligns
with the uncertainty the robust controller is being designed against. We show
through numerical experiments that the proposed robust adaptive controller can
significantly outperform the certainty equivalent controller on both expected
regret and measures of regret risk.]]></summary>

large, structured action spaces such as the [0,1] interval, where similar
actions are guaranteed to have similar rewards. A central theme here is the
adaptive discretization of the action space, which gradually ``zooms in'' on
the more promising regions thereof. The goal is to take advantage of ``nicer''
problem instances, while retaining near-optimal worst-case performance. While
the stochastic version of the problem is well-understood, the general version
with adversarial rewards is not. We provide the first algorithm for adaptive
discretization in the adversarial version, and derive instance-dependent regret
bounds. In particular, we recover the worst-case optimal regret bound for the
adversarial version, and the instance-dependent regret bound for the stochastic
version. Further, an application of our algorithm to dynamic pricing (where a
seller repeatedly adjusts prices for a product) enjoys these regret bounds
without any smoothness assumptions.]]></summary>

to represent the states of each time period, we model the dynamic pricing
problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Compared with the state-of-the-art
DRL-based dynamic pricing algorithms, our approaches make the following three
contributions. First, we extend the discrete set problem to the continuous
price set. Second, instead of using revenue as the reward function directly, we
define a new function named difference of revenue conversion rates (DRCR).
Third, the cold-start problem of MDP is tackled by pre-training and evaluation
using some carefully chosen historical sales data. Our approaches are evaluated
by both offline evaluation method using real dataset of Alibaba Inc., and
online field experiments starting from July 2018 with thousands of items,
lasting for months on Tmall.com. To our knowledge, there is no other DP field
experiment using DRL before. Field experiment results suggest that DRCR is a
more appropriate reward function than revenue, which is widely used by current

computer systems. In order to create these networks, engineers typically
specify a desired topology, and then use an automated training algorithm to
select the network's weights. While training algorithms have been studied
extensively and are well understood, the selection of topology remains a form
of art, and can often result in networks that are unnecessarily large - and
consequently are incompatible with end devices that have limited memory,
battery or computational power. Here, we propose to address this challenge by
harnessing recent advances in DNN verification. We present a framework and a
methodology for discovering redundancies in DNNs - i.e., for finding neurons
that are not needed, and can be removed in order to reduce the size of the DNN.
By using sound verification techniques, we can formally guarantee that our
simplified network is equivalent to the original, either completely, or up to a
prescribed tolerance. Further, we show how to combine our technique with
slicing, which results in a family of very small DNNs, which are together
equivalent to the original. Our approach can produce DNNs that are
significantly smaller than the original, rendering them suitable for deployment
on additional kinds of systems, and even more amenable to subsequent formal
verification. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of our approach, and

selection of sensor streams and sampling rates, enabling several applications,
such as power management and data-sharing control. While deep neural networks
(DNNs) achieve competitive accuracy in sensor data classification, DNNs
generally process incoming data from a fixed set of sensors with a fixed
sampling rate, and changes in the dimensions of their inputs cause considerable
accuracy loss, unnecessary computations, or failure in operation. We introduce
a dimension-adaptive pooling (DAP) layer that makes DNNs flexible and more
robust to changes in sensor availability and in sampling rate. DAP operates on
convolutional filter maps of variable dimensions and produces an input of fixed
dimensions suitable for feedforward and recurrent layers. We also propose a
dimension-adaptive training (DAT) procedure for enabling DNNs that use DAP to
better generalize over the set of feasible data dimensions at inference time.
DAT comprises the random selection of dimensions during the forward passes and
optimization with accumulated gradients of several backward passes. Combining
DAP and DAT, we show how to transform non-adaptive DNNs into a
Dimension-Adaptive Neural Architecture (DANA), while keeping the same number of
parameters. Compared to existing approaches, our solution provides better
classification accuracy over the range of possible data dimensions at inference
time and does not require up-sampling or imputation, thus reducing unnecessary
computations. Experiments on seven datasets (four benchmark real-world datasets
for human activity recognition and three synthetic datasets) show that DANA
prevents significant losses in classification accuracy of the state-of-the-art
DNNs and, compared to baselines, it better captures correlated patterns in

attracts much attention in recent years. It exploits acoustic transceivers such
as microphones and speakers beyond their primary functions, namely recording
and playing, to enable novel applications and new user experiences. In this
paper, we present the first systematic survey of recent advances in active
acoustic sensing using commodity hardware with a frequency range below
24~\!kHz. We propose a general framework that categorizes main building blocks
of acoustic sensing systems. This framework encompasses three layers, i.e.,
physical layer, core technique layer, and application layer. The physical layer
includes basic hardware components, acoustic platforms as well as the air-borne
and structure-borne channel characteristics. The core technique layer
encompasses key mechanisms to generate acoustic signals (waveforms) and to
extract useful temporal, spatial and spectral information from received
signals. The application layer builds upon the functions offered by the core
techniques to realize different acoustic sensing applications. We highlight
unique challenges due to the limitations of physical devices and acoustic
channels and how they are mitigated or overcame by core processing techniques
and application-specific solutions. Finally, research opportunities and future
directions are discussed to spawn further in-depth investigation on acoustic
sensing.]]></summary>

6-Degrees-Of-Freedom (DOF) single object grasping. Multi-finger grasping in
cluttered scenes, on the other hand, remains mostly unexplored due to the added
difficulty of reasoning over obstacles which greatly increases the
computational time to generate high-quality collision-free grasps. In this work
we address such limitations by introducing DDGC, a fast generative multi-finger
grasp sampling method that can generate high quality grasps in cluttered scenes
from a single RGB-D image. DDGC is built as a network that encodes scene
information to produce coarse-to-fine collision-free grasp poses and
configurations. We experimentally benchmark DDGC against the
simulated-annealing planner in GraspIt! on 1200 simulated cluttered scenes and
7 real world scenes. The results show that DDGC outperforms the baseline on
synthesizing high-quality grasps and removing clutter while being 5 times
faster. This, in turn, opens up the door for using multi-finger grasps in
practical applications which has so far been limited due to the excessive

model while still maintaining data privacy, without needing access to data
stored locally at the clients. However, FL suffers performance degradation when
client data distribution is non-IID, and a longer training duration to combat
this degradation may not necessarily be feasible due to communication
limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a new adaptive training
algorithm $\texttt{AdaFL}$, which comprises two components: (i) an
attention-based client selection mechanism for a fairer training scheme among
the clients; and (ii) a dynamic fraction method to balance the trade-off
between performance stability and communication efficiency. Experimental
results show that our $\texttt{AdaFL}$ algorithm outperforms the usual
$\texttt{FedAvg}$ algorithm, and can be incorporated to further improve various
state-of-the-art FL algorithms, with respect to three aspects: model accuracy,

empirical success, suffers from the curse of dimensionality. This paper builds
the mathematical framework to approximate cooperative MARL by a mean-field

dynamic programming principle for both the value function and the Q function,
it proposes a model-free kernel-based Q-learning algorithm (MFC-K-Q), which is
shown to have a linear convergence rate for the MFC problem, the first of its
kind in the MARL literature. It further establishes that the convergence rate
and the sample complexity of MFC-K-Q are independent of the number of agents
$N$, which provides an $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ approximation to the
MARL problem with $N$ agents in the learning environment. Empirical studies for
the network traffic congestion problem demonstrate that MFC-K-Q outperforms
existing MARL algorithms when $N$ is large, for instance when $N>50$.]]></summary>

(DWI) often limit the spatial resolution of the produced images to voxels up to
8 times larger than those of T1w images. Thus, the detailed information
contained in T1w imagescould help in the synthesis of diffusion images in
higher resolution. However, the non-Euclidean nature of diffusion imaging
hinders current deep generative models from synthesizing physically plausible
images. In this work, we propose the first Riemannian network architecture for
the direct generation of diffusion tensors (DT) and diffusion orientation
distribution functions (dODFs) from high-resolution T1w images. Our integration
of the Log-Euclidean Metric into a learning objective guarantees, unlike
standard Euclidean networks, the mathematically-valid synthesis of diffusion.
Furthermore, our approach improves the fractional anisotropy mean squared error
(FA MSE) between the synthesized diffusion and the ground-truth by more than
23% and the cosine similarity between principal directions by almost 5% when
compared to our baselines. We validate our generated diffusion by comparing the
resulting tractograms to our expected real data. We observe similar fiber
bundles with streamlines having less than 3% difference in length, less than 1%
difference in volume, and a visually close shape. While our method is able to
generate high-resolution diffusion images from structural inputs in less than
15 seconds, we acknowledge and discuss the limits of diffusion inference solely
relying on T1w images. Our results nonetheless suggest a relationship between
the high-level geometry of the brain and the overall white matter architecture.]]></summary>

discounted Markov Reward Processes (MRP) with nonlinear functions trained with
the Temporal-Difference (TD) learning algorithm. We first consider this problem
under a certain scaling of the approximating function, leading to a regime
called lazy training. In this regime, the parameters of the model vary only
slightly during the learning process, a feature that has recently been observed
in the training of neural networks, where the scaling we study arises
naturally, implicit in the initialization of their parameters. Both in the
under- and over-parametrized frameworks, we prove exponential convergence to
local, respectively global minimizers of the above algorithm in the lazy
training regime. We then compare this scaling of the parameters to the
mean-field regime, where the approximately linear behavior of the model is
lost. Under this alternative scaling we prove that all fixed points of the
dynamics in parameter space are global minimizers. We finally give examples of
our convergence results in the case of models that diverge if trained with
non-lazy TD learning, and in the case of neural networks.]]></summary>

data, placing a newfound burden on commodity networks and storage devices. A
common approach to conserve bandwidth involves resizing or compressing data
prior to training. We introduce Progressive Compressed Records (PCRs), a data
format that uses compression to reduce the overhead of fetching and
transporting data, effectively reducing the training time required to achieve a
target accuracy. PCRs deviate from previous storage formats by combining
progressive compression with an efficient storage layout to view a single
dataset at multiple fidelities---all without adding to the total dataset size.
We implement PCRs and evaluate them on a range of datasets, training tasks, and
hardware architectures. Our work shows that: (i) the amount of compression a
dataset can tolerate exceeds 50% of the original encoding for many DL training
tasks; (ii) it is possible to automatically and efficiently select appropriate
compression levels for a given task; and (iii) PCRs enable tasks to readily
access compressed data at runtime---utilizing as little as half the training

agent overly relying on this privileged information. This gives our agent the
opportunity to utilize rich and useful information about the future trajectory
dynamics in addition to the present. Our method, Policy Gradients Incorporating

privacy (DP) using a general metric, has been widely studied to provide
rigorous privacy guarantees while keeping high utility. However, existing works
on extended DP are limited to few metrics, such as the Euclidean metric.
Consequently, they have only a small number of applications, such as
location-based services and document processing. In this paper, we propose a
couple of mechanisms providing extended DP with a different metric: angular
distance (or cosine distance). Our mechanisms are based on locality sensitive
hashing (LSH), which can be applied to the angular distance and work well for
personal data in a high-dimensional space. We theoretically analyze the privacy
properties of our mechanisms, and prove extended DP for input data by taking
into account that LSH preserves the original metric only approximately. We
apply our mechanisms to friend matching based on high-dimensional personal data
with angular distance in the local model, and evaluate our mechanisms using two
real datasets. We show that LDP requires a very large privacy budget and that
RAPPOR does not work in this application. Then we show that our mechanisms
enable friend matching with high utility and rigorous privacy guarantees based
on extended DP.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We train embodied neural networks to plan and navigate unseen complex 3D
environments, emphasising real-world deployment. Rather than requiring prior
knowledge of the agent or environment, the planner learns to model the state
transitions and rewards. To avoid the potentially hazardous trial-and-error of
reinforcement learning, we focus on differentiable planners such as Value
Iteration Networks (VIN), which are trained offline from safe expert
demonstrations. Although they work well in small simulations, we address two
major limitations that hinder their deployment. First, we observed that current
differentiable planners struggle to plan long-term in environments with a high
branching complexity. While they should ideally learn to assign low rewards to
obstacles to avoid collisions, we posit that the constraints imposed on the
network are not strong enough to guarantee the network to learn sufficiently
large penalties for every possible collision. We thus impose a structural
constraint on the value iteration, which explicitly learns to model any
impossible actions. Secondly, we extend the model to work with a limited
perspective camera under translation and rotation, which is crucial for real
robot deployment. Many VIN-like planners assume a 360 degrees or overhead view
without rotation. In contrast, our method uses a memory-efficient lattice map
to aggregate CNN embeddings of partial observations, and models the rotational
dynamics explicitly using a 3D state-space grid (translation and rotation). Our
proposals significantly improve semantic navigation and exploration on several
2D and 3D environments, succeeding in settings that are otherwise challenging
for this class of methods. As far as we know, we are the first to successfully
perform differentiable planning on the difficult Active Vision Dataset,
consisting of real images captured from a robot.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the fields of statistics and unsupervised machine learning a fundamental
and well-studied problem is anomaly detection. Although anomalies are difficult
to define, many algorithms have been proposed. Underlying the approaches is the
nebulous understanding that anomalies are rare, unusual or inconsistent with
the majority of data. The present work gives a philosophical approach to
clearly define anomalies and to develop an algorithm for their efficient
detection with minimal user intervention. Inspired by the Gestalt School of
Psychology and the Helmholtz principle of human perception, the idea is to
assume anomalies are observations that are unexpected to occur with respect to
certain groupings made by the majority of the data. Thus, under appropriate
random variable modelling anomalies are directly found in a set of data under a
uniform and independent random assumption of the distribution of constituent
elements of the observations; anomalies correspond to those observations where
the expectation of occurrence of the elements in a given view is $<1$. Starting
from fundamental principles of human perception an unsupervised anomaly
detection algorithm is developed that is simple, real-time and parameter-free.
Experiments suggest it as the prime choice for univariate data and it shows
promising performance on the detection of global anomalies in multivariate
data.]]></summary>

quantitative measurement of UI is absent, despite the variations of UI can be
recognized by prior knowledge. The communication bandwidth of feature maps
decreases after downscaling operations, but UI flows smoothly after training
due to lower Nyquist frequency. Inspired by the low-Nyqusit-frequency nature of
UI, we propose the use of spectral roll-off points (SROPs) to estimate UI on
variations. The computation of an SROP is extended from a 1-D signal to a 2-D
image by the required rotation invariance in image classification tasks. SROP
statistics across feature maps are implemented as layer-wise useful information
estimates. We design sanity checks to explore SROP variations when UI
variations are produced by variations in model input, model architecture and
training stages. The variations of SROP is synchronizes with UI variations in
various randomized and sufficiently trained model structures. Therefore, SROP
variations is an accurate and convenient sign of UI variations, which promotes
the explainability of data representations with respect to frequency-domain
knowledge.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A central challenge in the computational modeling of neural dynamics is the
trade-off between accuracy and simplicity. At the level of individual neurons,
nonlinear dynamics are both experimentally established and essential for
neuronal functioning. An implicit assumption has thus formed that an accurate
computational model of whole-brain dynamics must also be highly nonlinear,
whereas linear models may provide a first-order approximation. Here, we provide
a rigorous and data-driven investigation of this hypothesis at the level of
whole-brain blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and macroscopic field potential
dynamics by leveraging the theory of system identification. Using functional
MRI (fMRI) and intracranial EEG (iEEG), we model the resting state activity of
700 subjects in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and 122 subjects from the
Restoring Active Memory (RAM) project using state-of-the-art linear and
nonlinear model families. We assess relative model fit using predictive power,
computational complexity, and the extent of residual dynamics unexplained by
the model. Contrary to our expectations, linear auto-regressive models achieve
the best measures across all three metrics, eliminating the trade-off between
accuracy and simplicity. To understand and explain this linearity, we highlight
four properties of macroscopic neurodynamics which can counteract or mask
microscopic nonlinear dynamics: averaging over space, averaging over time,
observation noise, and limited data samples. Whereas the latter two are
technological limitations and can improve in the future, the former two are
inherent to aggregated macroscopic brain activity. Our results, together with
the unparalleled interpretability of linear models, can greatly facilitate our
understanding of macroscopic neural dynamics and the principled design of
model-based interventions for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.]]></summary>

answers in this dataset, we propose a training procedure based on a contrastive
loss between a video-question multi-modal transformer and an answer
transformer. We introduce the zero-shot VideoQA task and show excellent
results, in particular for rare answers. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method
to significantly outperform the state of the art on MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA,

compositional generalisation. Whether neural networks exhibit this ability is
typically studied using artificial languages, for which the compositionality of

However, compositionality in natural language is vastly more complex than this
rigid, arithmetics-like version of compositionality, and as such artificial
compositionality tests do not allow us to draw conclusions about how neural
models deal with compositionality in more realistic scenarios. In this work, we
re-instantiate three compositionality tests from the literature and reformulate
them for neural machine translation (NMT). The results highlight two main
issues: the inconsistent behaviour of NMT models and their inability to
(correctly) modulate between local and global processing. Aside from an
empirical study, our work is a call to action: we should rethink the evaluation
of compositionality in neural networks of natural language, where composing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spurred by a huge interest in the post-Shannon communication, it has recently
been shown that leveraging semantics can significantly improve the
communication effectiveness across many tasks. In this article, inspired by
human communication, we propose a novel stochastic model of System 1
semantics-native communication (SNC) for generic tasks, where a speaker has an
intention of referring to an entity, extracts the semantics, and communicates
its symbolic representation to a target listener. To further reach its full
potential, we additionally infuse contextual reasoning into SNC such that the
speaker locally and iteratively self-communicates with a virtual agent built on
the physical listener's unique way of coding its semantics, i.e., communication
context. The resultant System 2 SNC allows the speaker to extract the most
effective semantics for its listener. Leveraging the proposed stochastic model,
we show that the reliability of System 2 SNC increases with the number of
meaningful concepts, and derive the expected semantic representation (SR) bit
length which quantifies the extracted effective semantics. It is also shown
that System 2 SNC significantly reduces the SR length without compromising
communication reliability.]]></summary>

computationally efficient, but also has more representation power,
outperforming MobileNetV3 at low FLOP regime from 25M to 500M FLOPs on ImageNet

Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) volumes are crucial for surgical

of effectively exploiting the information from PET and CT as well as resolving
their uncertainty remain a challenge. In this paper, we propose an lymphoma
segmentation model using an UNet with an evidential PET/CT fusion layer.
Single-modality volumes are trained separately to get initial segmentation maps
and an evidential fusion layer is proposed to fuse the two pieces of evidence
using Dempster-Shafer theory (DST). Moreover, a multi-task loss function is
proposed: in addition to the use of the Dice loss for PET and CT segmentation,
a loss function based on the concordance between the two segmentation is added
to constrain the final segmentation. We evaluate our proposal on a database of
polycentric PET/CT volumes of patients treated for lymphoma, delineated by the
experts. Our method get accurate segmentation results with Dice score of 0.726,
without any user interaction. Quantitative results show that our method is

by training data is a well-known problem typically resolved with generalization
methods. A surprising result from recent knowledge distillation (KD) literature
is that random, untrained, and equally structured teacher networks can also
vastly improve generalization performance. It raises the possibility of
existence of undiscovered assumptions useful for generalization on an uncertain
region. In this paper, we shed light on the assumptions by analyzing decision
boundaries and confidence distributions of both simple and KD-based
generalization methods. Assuming that a decision boundary exists to represent
the most general tendency of distinction on an input sample space (i.e., the
simplest hypothesis), we show the various limitations of methods when using the
hypothesis. To resolve these limitations, we propose matured dumb teacher based
KD, conservatively transferring the hypothesis for generalization of the
student without massive destruction of trained information. In practical
experiments on feed-forward and convolution neural networks for image
classification tasks on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, the proposed
method shows stable improvement to the best test performance in the grid search
of hyperparameters. The analysis and results imply that the proposed method can

in making these solutions business-grade. One major challenge is to ensure that
the ML solution provides its expected business value. In order to do that, one
has to bridge the gap between the way ML model performance is measured and the
solution requirements. In previous work (Barash et al, "Bridging the gap...")
we demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing feature models in bridging this
gap. Whereas ML performance metrics, such as the accuracy or F1-score of a
classifier, typically measure the average ML performance, feature models shed
light on explainable data slices that are too far from that average, and
therefore might indicate unsatisfied requirements. For example, the overall
accuracy of a bank text terms classifier may be very high, say $98\% \pm 2\%$,
yet it might perform poorly for terms that include short descriptions and
originate from commercial accounts. A business requirement, which may be
implicit in the training data, may be to perform well regardless of the type of
account and length of the description. Therefore, the under-performing data
slice that includes short descriptions and commercial accounts suggests
poorly-met requirements. In this paper we show the feasibility of automatically
extracting feature models that result in explainable data slices over which the
ML solution under-performs. Our novel technique, IBM FreaAI aka FreaAI,
extracts such slices from structured ML test data or any other labeled data. We
demonstrate that FreaAI can automatically produce explainable and
statistically-significant data slices over seven open datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the difficulties of conversion rate (CVR) prediction is that the
conversions can delay and take place long after the clicks. The delayed
feedback poses a challenge: fresh data are beneficial to continuous training
but may not have complete label information at the time they are ingested into
the training pipeline. To balance model freshness and label certainty, previous
methods set a short waiting window or even do not wait for the conversion
signal. If conversion happens outside the waiting window, this sample will be
duplicated and ingested into the training pipeline with a positive label.
However, these methods have some issues. First, they assume the observed
feature distribution remains the same as the actual distribution. But this
assumption does not hold due to the ingestion of duplicated samples. Second,
the certainty of the conversion action only comes from the positives. But the
positives are scarce as conversions are sparse in commercial systems. These
issues induce bias during the modeling of delayed feedback. In this paper, we
propose DElayed FEedback modeling with Real negatives (DEFER) method to address
these issues. The proposed method ingests real negative samples into the
training pipeline. The ingestion of real negatives ensures the observed feature
distribution is equivalent to the actual distribution, thus reducing the bias.
The ingestion of real negatives also brings more certainty information of the
conversion. To correct the distribution shift, DEFER employs importance
sampling to weigh the loss function. Experimental results on industrial
datasets validate the superiority of DEFER. DEFER have been deployed in the
display advertising system of Alibaba, obtaining over 6.0% improvement on CVR
in several scenarios. The code and data in this paper are now open-sourced

seen as natural multi-dimensional generalisations of signatures of paths; our
work therefore aims to extend the recent use of signatures in data science

model feature vector associated to a space-time signal, along with two
algorithms which illustrate ways in which these features can be combined with
linear regression. We apply these algorithms in several numerical experiments
designed to learn solutions to PDEs with a given forcing and boundary data. Our
experiments include semi-linear parabolic and wave equations with forcing, and
Burgers' equation with no forcing. We find an advantage in favour of our

silver bullet diagnostic test to discern COVID infection. Rapid antigen
detection is a screening test to identify COVID positive patients in little as
15 minutes, but has a lower sensitivity than the PCR tests. Besides having
multiple standardized test kits, many people are getting infected & either
recovering or dying even before the test due to the shortage and cost of kits,
lack of indispensable specialists and labs, time-consuming result compared to
bulk population especially in developing and underdeveloped countries.
Intrigued by the parametric deviations in immunological & hematological profile
of a COVID patient, this research work leveraged the concept of COVID-19
detection by proposing a risk-free and highly accurate Stacked Ensemble Machine
Learning model to identify a COVID patient from communally
available-widespread-cheap routine blood tests which gives a promising
accuracy, precision, recall & F1-score of 100%. Analysis from R-curve also
shows the preciseness of the risk-free model to be implemented. The proposed
method has the potential for large scale ubiquitous low-cost screening
application. This can add an extra layer of protection in keeping the number of
infected cases to a minimum and control the pandemic by identifying
asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people early.]]></summary>

technology. It learns a model with general language features on the vast text
and then fine-tunes the model using a task-specific dataset. Unfortunately, PTM
training requires prohibitively expensive computing devices, especially
fine-tuning, which is still a game for a small proportion of people in the AI
community. Enabling PTMs training on low-quality devices, PatrickStar now makes
PTM accessible to everyone.

PatrickStar reduces memory requirements of computing platforms by using the
CPU-GPU heterogeneous memory space to store model data, consisting of
parameters, gradients, and optimizer states. We observe that the GPU memory
available for model data changes regularly, in a tide-like pattern, decreasing
and increasing iteratively. However, the existing heterogeneous training works
do not take advantage of this pattern. Instead, they statically partition the
model data among CPU and GPU, leading to both memory waste and memory abuse. In
contrast, PatrickStar manages model data in chunks, which are dynamically
distributed in heterogeneous memory spaces. Chunks consist of stateful tensors
which run as finite state machines during training. Guided by the runtime
memory statistics collected in a warm-up iteration, chunks are orchestrated
efficiently in heterogeneous memory and generate lower CPU-GPU data
transmission volume. Symbiosis with the Zero Redundancy Optimizer, PatrickStar
scales to multiple GPUs using data parallelism, with the lowest communication
bandwidth requirements and more efficient bandwidth utilization. Experimental
results show PatrickStar trains a 12 billion parameters GPT model, 2x larger
than the STOA work, on an 8-V100 and 240GB CPU memory node, and is also more
efficient on the same model size.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the increasing popularity of deep learning on edge devices, compressing
large neural networks to meet the hardware requirements of resource-constrained
devices became a significant research direction. Numerous compression
methodologies are currently being used to reduce the memory sizes and energy
consumption of neural networks. Knowledge distillation (KD) is among such
methodologies and it functions by using data samples to transfer the knowledge
captured by a large model (teacher) to a smaller one(student). However, due to
various reasons, the original training data might not be accessible at the
compression stage. Therefore, data-free model compression is an ongoing
research problem that has been addressed by various works. In this paper, we
point out that catastrophic forgetting is a problem that can potentially be
observed in existing data-free distillation methods. Moreover, the sample
generation strategies in some of these methods could result in a mismatch
between the synthetic and real data distributions. To prevent such problems, we
propose a data-free KD framework that maintains a dynamic collection of
generated samples over time. Additionally, we add the constraint of matching
the real data distribution in sample generation strategies that target maximum
information gain. Our experiments demonstrate that we can improve the accuracy
of the student models obtained via KD when compared with state-of-the-art
approaches on the SVHN, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR100 datasets.]]></summary>

devised to represent entities and relations in dense vector space and employed
in downstream tasks such as link prediction. A few KGE techniques address
interpretability, i.e., mapping the connectivity patterns of the relations
(i.e., symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, and composition) to a geometric
interpretation such as rotations. Other approaches model the representations in
higher dimensional space such as four-dimensional space (4D) to enhance the
ability to infer the connectivity patterns (i.e., expressiveness). However,
modeling relation and entity in a 4D space often comes at the cost of
interpretability. This paper proposes HopfE, a novel KGE approach aiming to
achieve the interpretability of inferred relations in the four-dimensional
space. We first model the structural embeddings in 3D Euclidean space and view
the relation operator as an SO(3) rotation. Next, we map the entity embedding
vector from a 3D space to a 4D hypersphere using the inverse Hopf Fibration, in
which we embed the semantic information from the KG ontology. Thus, HopfE
considers the structural and semantic properties of the entities without losing
expressivity and interpretability. Our empirical results on four well-known
benchmarks achieve state-of-the-art performance for the KG completion task.]]></summary>

verification (ASV) systems, urging us to design a synthetic speech detection
system to protect ASV systems. In this paper, we propose a new speech
anti-spoofing model named ResWavegram-Resnet (RW-Resnet). The model contains
two parts, Conv1D Resblocks and backbone Resnet34. The Conv1D Resblock is based
on the Conv1D block with a residual connection. For the first part, we use the
raw waveform as input and feed it to the stacked Conv1D Resblocks to get the
ResWavegram. Compared with traditional methods, ResWavegram keeps all the
information from the audio signal and has a stronger ability in extracting
features. For the second part, the extracted features are fed to the backbone
Resnet34 for the spoofed or bonafide decision. The ASVspoof2019 logical access

show that the RW-Resnet achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do the neural networks distinguish two images? It is of critical
importance to understand the matching mechanism of deep models for developing
reliable intelligent systems for many risky visual applications such as
surveillance and access control. However, most existing deep metric learning
methods match the images by comparing feature vectors, which ignores the
spatial structure of images and thus lacks interpretability. In this paper, we
present a deep interpretable metric learning (DIML) method for more transparent
embedding learning. Unlike conventional metric learning methods based on
feature vector comparison, we propose a structural matching strategy that
explicitly aligns the spatial embeddings by computing an optimal matching flow
between feature maps of the two images. Our method enables deep models to learn
metrics in a more human-friendly way, where the similarity of two images can be
decomposed to several part-wise similarities and their contributions to the
overall similarity. Our method is model-agnostic, which can be applied to
off-the-shelf backbone networks and metric learning methods. We evaluate our
method on three major benchmarks of deep metric learning including CUB200-2011,
Cars196, and Stanford Online Products, and achieve substantial improvements
over popular metric learning methods with better interpretability. Code is

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large-scale pretraining of visual representations has led to state-of-the-art
performance on a range of benchmark computer vision tasks, yet the benefits of
these techniques at extreme scale in complex production systems has been
relatively unexplored. We consider the case of a popular visual discovery
product, where these representations are trained with multi-task learning, from
use-case specific visual understanding (e.g. skin tone classification) to
general representation learning for all visual content (e.g. embeddings for
retrieval). In this work, we describe how we (1) generate a dataset with over a
billion images via large weakly-supervised pretraining to improve the
performance of these visual representations, and (2) leverage Transformers to
replace the traditional convolutional backbone, with insights into both system
and performance improvements, especially at 1B+ image scale. To support this
backbone model, we detail a systematic approach to deriving weakly-supervised
image annotations from heterogenous text signals, demonstrating the benefits of
clustering techniques to handle the long-tail distribution of image labels.
Through a comprehensive study of offline and online evaluation, we show that
large-scale Transformer-based pretraining provides significant benefits to
industry computer vision applications. The model is deployed in a production
visual shopping system, with 36% improvement in top-1 relevance and 23%
improvement in click-through volume. We conduct extensive experiments to better
understand the empirical relationships between Transformer-based architectures,
dataset scale, and the performance of production vision systems.]]></summary>

makes this framework attractive in various practical applications. However,
this property is achieved at a price of reduction in precision. In the case of
conformal classification, the systems can output multiple class labels instead

function has a major impact on the efficiency of conformal classifiers.
Recently, it was shown that different model-agnostic nonconformity functions
result in conformal classifiers with different characteristics. For a Neural
Network-based conformal classifier, the inverse probability (or hinge loss)
allows minimizing the average number of predicted labels, and margin results in
a larger fraction of singleton predictions. In this work, we aim to further
extend this study. We perform an experimental evaluation using 8 different

laws but also impacted by the localized factor in spatial and temporal regions.
One of the major challenges is to infer the underlying causes, which generate
the perceived data stream and propagate the involved causal dynamics through
the distributed observing units. Another challenge is that the success of
machine learning based predictive models requires massive annotated data for
model training. However, the acquisition of high-quality annotated data is
objectively manual and tedious as it needs a considerable amount of human
intervention, making it infeasible in fields that require high levels of
expertise. To tackle these challenges, we advocate a spatio-temporal
physics-coupled neural networks (ST-PCNN) model to learn the underlying physics
of the dynamical system and further couple the learned physics to assist the
learning of the recurring dynamics. To deal with data-acquisition constraints,
an active learning mechanism with Kriging for actively acquiring the most
informative data is proposed for ST-PCNN training in a partially observable
environment. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets exhibit
that the proposed ST-PCNN with active learning converges to near optimal
accuracy with substantially fewer instances.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: Gaussian mixture modeling is a fundamental tool in clustering, as
well as discriminant analysis and semiparametric density estimation. However,
estimating the optimal model for any given number of components is an NP-hard
problem, and estimating the number of components is in some respects an even
harder problem. Findings: In R, a popular package called mclust addresses both
of these problems. However, Python has lacked such a package. We therefore
introduce AutoGMM, a Python algorithm for automatic Gaussian mixture modeling,
and its hierarchical version, HGMM. AutoGMM builds upon scikit-learn's
AgglomerativeClustering and GaussianMixture classes, with certain modifications
to make the results more stable. Empirically, on several different
applications, AutoGMM performs approximately as well as mclust, and sometimes
better. Conclusions: AutoMM, a freely available Python package, enables
efficient Gaussian mixture modeling by automatically selecting the
initialization, number of clusters and covariance constraints.]]></summary>

a popular choice for solving classification and ranking problems. Without
appropriately tuned $\ell_2$ regularization or weight decay, such networks have
the tendency to make output scores (logits) and network weights large, causing
training loss to become too small and the network to lose its adaptivity
(ability to move around) in the parameter space. Although regularization is
typically understood from an overfitting perspective, we highlight its role in
making the network more adaptive and enabling it to escape more easily from
weights that generalize poorly. To provide such a capability, we propose a
method called Logit Attenuating Weight Normalization (LAWN), that can be
stacked onto any gradient-based optimizer. LAWN controls the logits by
constraining the weight norms of layers in the final homogeneous sub-network.
Empirically, we show that the resulting LAWN variant of the optimizer makes a
deep network more adaptive to finding minimas with superior generalization
performance on large-scale image classification and recommender systems. While
LAWN is particularly impressive in improving Adam, it greatly improves all
optimizers when used with large batch sizes]]></summary>

datasets. Manual annotation of questions and answers for videos, however, is
tedious, expensive and prevents scalability. In this work, we propose to avoid
manual annotation and generate a large-scale training dataset for video
question answering making use of automatic cross-modal supervision. We leverage
a question generation transformer trained on text data and use it to generate
question-answer pairs from transcribed video narrations. Given narrated videos,
we then automatically generate the HowToVQA69M dataset with 69M
video-question-answer triplets. To handle the open vocabulary of diverse
answers in this dataset, we propose a training procedure based on a contrastive
loss between a video-question multi-modal transformer and an answer
transformer. We introduce the zero-shot VideoQA task and show excellent
results, in particular for rare answers. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method
to significantly outperform the state of the art on MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA,
ActivityNet-QA and How2QA. Finally, for a detailed evaluation we introduce
iVQA, a new VideoQA dataset with reduced language biases and high-quality

the discovery of the best candidates in the set of possible architectures
tractable and efficient, in terms of GPU days. This method eliminates the
requirement for training the networks from scratch for the incoming target task
as well as introducing the bias in the initialization of the search space from
the human domain. Experimental results with 8 classification tasks in MNIST and

as FMA-PG) for designing policy gradient methods. The functional perspective
distinguishes between a policy's functional representation (what are its
sufficient statistics) and its parameterization (how are these statistics
represented) and naturally results in computationally efficient off-policy
updates. For simple policy parameterizations, the FMA-PG framework ensures that
the optimal policy is a fixed point of the updates. It also allows us to handle
complex policy parameterizations (e.g., neural networks) while guaranteeing
policy improvement. Our framework unifies several PG methods and opens the way
for designing sample-efficient variants of existing methods. Moreover, it
recovers important implementation heuristics (e.g., using forward vs reverse KL
divergence) in a principled way. With a softmax functional representation,
FMA-PG results in a variant of TRPO with additional desirable properties. It
also suggests an improved variant of PPO, whose robustness and efficiency we
empirically demonstrate on MuJoCo. Via experiments on simple reinforcement
learning problems, we evaluate algorithms instantiated by FMA-PG.]]></summary>

create opportunities for greater edge intelligence. In the domain of vision,
the ability to adapt a Convolutional Neural Network's (CNN) structure and
parameters to the input data distribution leads to systems with lower memory
footprint, latency and power consumption. However, due to the limited compute
resources and memory budget on edge devices, it is necessary for the system to
be able to predict the latency and memory footprint of the training process in
order to identify favourable training configurations of the network topology
and device combination for efficient network adaptation. This work proposes
perf4sight, an automated methodology for developing accurate models that
predict CNN training memory footprint and latency given a target device and
network. This enables rapid identification of network topologies that can be
retrained on the edge device with low resource consumption. With PyTorch as the
framework and NVIDIA Jetson TX2 as the target device, the developed models

through time-consuming schemes. This diminishes the detectors' speed, thereby
becoming the computational bottleneck in advanced oriented object detection
systems. This work proposes an effective and simple oriented object detection
framework, termed Oriented R-CNN, which is a general two-stage oriented
detector with promising accuracy and efficiency. To be specific, in the first
stage, we propose an oriented Region Proposal Network (oriented RPN) that
directly generates high-quality oriented proposals in a nearly cost-free
manner. The second stage is oriented R-CNN head for refining oriented Regions
of Interest (oriented RoIs) and recognizing them. Without tricks, oriented
R-CNN with ResNet50 achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy on two
commonly-used datasets for oriented object detection including DOTA (75.87%
mAP) and HRSC2016 (96.50% mAP), while having a speed of 15.1 FPS with the image
size of 1024$\times$1024 on a single RTX 2080Ti. We hope our work could inspire
rethinking the design of oriented detectors and serve as a baseline for
oriented object detection. Code is available at

occlusions, and its central problem is multiview aggregation. Given feature map
projections from multiple views onto a common ground plane, the
state-of-the-art method addresses this problem via convolution, which applies

different positions and cameras to deal with various shadow-like distortions.

may encounter appearance deterioration, which introduces great confusion for
detection. One of the popular solutions is to exploit the temporal information
and enhance per-frame representation through aggregating features from
neighboring frames. Despite achieving improvements in detection, existing
methods focus on the selection of higher-level video frames for aggregation
rather than modeling lower-level temporal relations to increase the feature
representation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel solution named
TF-Blender,which includes three modules: 1) Temporal relation mod-els the
relations between the current frame and its neighboring frames to preserve
spatial information. 2). Feature adjustment enriches the representation of
every neigh-boring feature map; 3) Feature blender combines outputs from the
first two modules and produces stronger features for the later detection tasks.
For its simplicity, TF-Blender can be effortlessly plugged into any detection
network to improve detection behavior. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet VID
and YouTube-VIS benchmarks indicate the performance guarantees of using
TF-Blender on recent state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

frequently claiming highly accurate detection under deep transfer learning.
This is leading medical technologists to believe that deep transfer learning is

published results. Hence, we conduct a systematic thorough investigation to
analyze the effectiveness of deep transfer learning for COVID-19 detection with
CT images. Exploring 14 state-of-the-art visual models with over 200 model
training sessions, we conclusively establish that the published literature is
frequently overestimating transfer learning performance for the problem, even
in the prestigious scientific sources. The roots of overestimation trace back
to inappropriate data curation. We also provide case studies that consider more
realistic scenarios, and establish transparent baselines for the problem. We
hope that our reproducible investigation will help in curbing hype-driven

where the robot should robustly track and accurately localize the target for
efficient following. In this paper, we propose a 3D tracking method called
3D-SiamRPN Network to track a single target object by using raw 3D point cloud
data. The proposed network consists of two subnetworks. The first subnetwork is
feature embedding subnetwork which is used for point cloud feature extraction
and fusion. In this subnetwork, we first use PointNet++ to extract features of
point cloud from template and search branches. Then, to fuse the information of
features in the two branches and obtain their similarity, we propose two cross
correlation modules, named Pointcloud-wise and Point-wise respectively. The
second subnetwork is region proposal network(RPN), which is used to get the
final 3D bounding box of the target object based on the fusion feature from
cross correlation modules. In this subnetwork, we utilize the regression and
classification branches of a region proposal subnetwork to obtain proposals and
scores, thus get the final 3D bounding box of the target object. Experimental
results on KITTI dataset show that our method has a competitive performance in
both Success and Precision compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and could
run in real-time at 20.8 FPS. Additionally, experimental results on H3D dataset
demonstrate that our method also has good generalization ability and could

due to sparsity of boundaries in image. We observe two key issues in existing
works: firstly, lack of an architecture which can exploit the limited amount of
coupling in the decoder stage between the two subtasks, namely occlusion
boundary extraction and occlusion orientation prediction, and secondly,
improper representation of occlusion orientation. In this paper, we propose a
novel architecture called Occlusion-shared and Path-separated Network (OPNet),
which solves the first issue by exploiting rich occlusion cues in shared
high-level features and structured spatial information in task-specific
low-level features. We then design a simple but effective orthogonal occlusion
representation (OOR) to tackle the second issue. Our method surpasses the
state-of-the-art methods by 6.1%/8.3% Boundary-AP and 6.5%/10% Orientation-AP

problem of Boolean functional synthesis is to synthesise each output as a
function of inputs such that the specification is met. Although the past few
years have witnessed intense algorithmic development, accomplishing scalability
remains the holy grail. The state-of-the-art approach combines machine learning
and automated reasoning to efficiently synthesise Boolean functions. In this
paper, we propose four algorithmic improvements for a data-driven framework for
functional synthesis: using a dependency-driven multi-classifier to learn
candidate function, extracting uniquely defined functions by interpolation,
variables retention, and using lexicographic MaxSAT to repair candidates. We
implement these improvements in the state-of-the-art framework, called Manthan.
The proposed framework is called Manthan2. Manthan2 shows significantly
improved runtime performance compared to Manthan. In an extensive experimental
evaluation on 609 benchmarks, Manthan2 is able to synthesise a Boolean function
vector for 509 instances compared to 356 instances solved by Manthan--- an
increment of 153 instances over the state-of-the-art. To put this into
perspective, Manthan improved on the prior state-of-the-art by only 76
instances.]]></summary>

information between training and test time; additional information is given
about the training data, which is not available at test time. Learning under
this setting is called Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI). At the
same time, due to the ordinal nature of affect annotations, formulating affect
modelling tasks as supervised learning ranking problems is gaining ground
within the Affective Computing research community. Motivated by the two facts
above, in this study, we introduce a ranking model that treats additional
information about the training data as privileged information to accurately
rank affect states. Our ranking model extends the well-known RankNet model to
the LUPI paradigm, hence its name AffRankNet+. To the best of our knowledge, it
is the first time that a ranking model based on neural networks exploits
privileged information. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model on
the public available Afew-VA dataset and compare it against the RankNet model,
which does not use privileged information. Experimental evaluation indicates
that the AffRankNet+ model can yield significantly better performance.]]></summary>

show that early stopping is crucial for gradient descent to converge to a

result is in sharp contrast to known results for noiseless and
uncorrelated-design cases. We characterize the impact of depth and early
stopping and show that for a general depth parameter N, gradient descent with

that specifically benefit the training of a strong model for the task. A newly
proposed framework for framing the active learning workflow as a reinforcement
learning problem is adapted for image classification and a series of three
experiments is conducted. Each experiment is evaluated and potential issues
with the approach are outlined. Each following experiment then proposes
improvements to the framework and evaluates their impact. After the last

(NNS) with the best worst-case guarantees are based on the randomized Locality
Sensitive Hashing (LSH), and its derivatives. In practice, many heuristic
approaches exist to "learn" the best indexing method in order to speed-up NNS,
crucially adapting to the structure of the given dataset.

Oftentimes, these heuristics outperform the LSH-based algorithms on real
datasets, but, almost always, come at the cost of losing the guarantees of
either correctness or robust performance on adversarial queries, or apply to
datasets with an assumed extra structure/model. In this paper, we design an NNS
algorithm for the Hamming space that has worst-case guarantees essentially
matching that of theoretical algorithms, while optimizing the hashing to the
structure of the dataset (think instance-optimal algorithms) for performance on
the minimum-performing query. We evaluate the algorithm's ability to optimize
for a given dataset both theoretically and practically. On the theoretical
side, we exhibit a natural setting (dataset model) where our algorithm is much
better than the standard theoretical one. On the practical side, we run
experiments that show that our algorithm has a 1.8x and 2.1x better recall on
the worst-performing queries to the MNIST and ImageNet datasets.]]></summary>

page are critical to the effectiveness and perception of a search system. A
search ranking system typically orders the results by independent
query-document scores to produce a slate of search results. However, such
unilateral scoring methods may fail to capture inter-document dependencies that
users are sensitive to, thus producing a sub-optimal slate. Further, in
practice, many real-world applications such as e-commerce search require
enforcing certain distributional criteria at the slate-level, due to business
objectives or long term user retention goals. Unilateral scoring of results
does not explicitly support optimizing for such objectives with respect to a
slate. Hence, solutions to the slate optimization problem must consider the
optimal selection and order of the documents, along with adherence to
slate-level distributional criteria. To that end, we propose a hybrid framework
extended from traditional slate optimization to solve the conditional slate
optimization problem. We introduce conditional sequential slate optimization
(CSSO), which jointly learns to optimize for traditional ranking metrics as
well as prescribed distribution criteria of documents within the slate. The
proposed method can be applied to practical real world problems such as
enforcing diversity in e-commerce search results, mitigating bias in top
results and personalization of results. Experiments on public datasets and
real-world data from e-commerce datasets show that CSSO outperforms popular
comparable ranking methods in terms of adherence to distributional criteria
while producing comparable or better relevance metrics.]]></summary>

disease, CT-based COVID-19 detection with visual models is currently at the
forefront of medical imaging research. Outcomes published in this direction are
frequently claiming highly accurate detection under deep transfer learning.
This is leading medical technologists to believe that deep transfer learning is

published results. Hence, we conduct a systematic thorough investigation to
analyze the effectiveness of deep transfer learning for COVID-19 detection with
CT images. Exploring 14 state-of-the-art visual models with over 200 model
training sessions, we conclusively establish that the published literature is
frequently overestimating transfer learning performance for the problem, even
in the prestigious scientific sources. The roots of overestimation trace back
to inappropriate data curation. We also provide case studies that consider more
realistic scenarios, and establish transparent baselines for the problem. We

Following this framework, we further propose a simple and effective OoD

neural architecture search, due to its promising results for image
classification. The main benefit of DARTS is the effectiveness achieved through
the weight-sharing one-shot paradigm, which allows efficient architecture

inverse problems, which allows us to analyze these potential benefits in a
controlled manner. Although we demonstrate that the success of DARTS can be
extended from image classification to reconstruction, our experiments yield
three fundamental difficulties in the evaluation of DARTS-based methods: First,
the results show a large variance in all test cases. Second, the final
performance is highly dependent on the hyperparameters of the optimizer. And
third, the performance of the weight-sharing architecture used during training
does not reflect the final performance of the found architecture well. Thus, we
conclude the necessity to 1) report the results of any DARTS-based methods from
several runs along with its underlying performance statistics, 2) show the
correlation of the training and final architecture performance, and 3)
carefully consider if the computational efficiency of DARTS outweighs the costs

function approximation and a simulator. We assume that the agent only has local
access to the simulator, meaning that the agent can only query the simulator at
states that have been visited before. This setting is more practical than many
prior works on reinforcement learning with a generative model. We propose an
algorithm named confident Monte Carlo least square policy iteration (Confident
MC-LSPI) for this setting. Under the assumption that the Q-functions of all
deterministic policies are linear in known features of the state-action pairs,
we show that our algorithm has polynomial query and computational complexities
in the dimension of the features, the effective planning horizon and the
targeted sub-optimality, while these complexities are independent of the size
of the state space. One technical contribution of our work is the introduction
of a novel proof technique that makes use of a virtual policy iteration
algorithm. We use this method to leverage existing results on
$\ell_\infty$-bounded approximate policy iteration to show that our algorithm
can learn the optimal policy for the given initial state even only with local
access to the simulator. We believe that this technique can be extended to
broader settings beyond this work.]]></summary>

Rendezvous and Optical Navigation (TRON) at Stanford University - the first
robotic testbed capable of validating machine learning algorithms for
spaceborne optical navigation. The TRON facility consists of two 6
degrees-of-freedom KUKA robot arms and a set of Vicon motion track cameras to
reconfigure an arbitrary relative pose between a camera and a target mockup
model. The facility includes multiple Earth albedo light boxes and a sun lamp
to recreate the high-fidelity spaceborne illumination conditions. After the
overview of the facility, this work details the multi-source calibration
procedure which enables the estimation of the relative pose between the object
and the camera with millimeter-level position and millidegree-level orientation
accuracies. Finally, a comparative analysis of the synthetic and TRON simulated
imageries is performed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pre-trained

playing an increasingly important role in our daily lives. The key of
recommender systems is to predict how likely users will interact with items
based on their historical online behaviors, e.g., clicks, add-to-cart,
purchases, etc. To exploit these user-item interactions, there are increasing
efforts on considering the user-item interactions as a user-item bipartite
graph and then performing information propagation in the graph via Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). Given the power of GNNs in graph representation learning,
these GNN-based recommendation methods have remarkably boosted the
recommendation performance. Despite their success, most existing GNN-based
recommender systems overlook the existence of interactions caused by unreliable
behaviors (e.g., random/bait clicks) and uniformly treat all the interactions,
which can lead to sub-optimal and unstable performance. In this paper, we
investigate the drawbacks (e.g., non-adaptive propagation and non-robustness)
of existing GNN-based recommendation methods. To address these drawbacks, we
propose the Graph Trend Networks for recommendations (GTN) with principled
designs that can capture the adaptive reliability of the interactions.
Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies are presented to verify and
understand the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Our implementation and
datasets can be released after publication.]]></summary>

(DWI) often limit the spatial resolution of the produced images to voxels up to
8 times larger than those of T1w images. Thus, the detailed information
contained in T1w imagescould help in the synthesis of diffusion images in
higher resolution. However, the non-Euclidean nature of diffusion imaging
hinders current deep generative models from synthesizing physically plausible
images. In this work, we propose the first Riemannian network architecture for
the direct generation of diffusion tensors (DT) and diffusion orientation
distribution functions (dODFs) from high-resolution T1w images. Our integration
of the Log-Euclidean Metric into a learning objective guarantees, unlike
standard Euclidean networks, the mathematically-valid synthesis of diffusion.
Furthermore, our approach improves the fractional anisotropy mean squared error
(FA MSE) between the synthesized diffusion and the ground-truth by more than
23% and the cosine similarity between principal directions by almost 5% when
compared to our baselines. We validate our generated diffusion by comparing the
resulting tractograms to our expected real data. We observe similar fiber
bundles with streamlines having less than 3% difference in length, less than 1%
difference in volume, and a visually close shape. While our method is able to
generate high-resolution diffusion images from structural inputs in less than
15 seconds, we acknowledge and discuss the limits of diffusion inference solely
relying on T1w images. Our results nonetheless suggest a relationship between
the high-level geometry of the brain and the overall white matter architecture.]]></summary>

type of deep neural network mainly based on the self-attention mechanism.
Thanks to its strong representation capabilities, researchers are looking at
ways to apply transformer to computer vision tasks. In a variety of visual
benchmarks, transformer-based models perform similar to or better than other
types of networks such as convolutional and recurrent networks. Given its high
performance and less need for vision-specific inductive bias, transformer is
receiving more and more attention from the computer vision community. In this
paper, we review these vision transformer models by categorizing them in
different tasks and analyzing their advantages and disadvantages. The main
categories we explore include the backbone network, high/mid-level vision,
low-level vision, and video processing. We also include efficient transformer
methods for pushing transformer into real device-based applications.
Furthermore, we also take a brief look at the self-attention mechanism in
computer vision, as it is the base component in transformer. Toward the end of
this paper, we discuss the challenges and provide several further research
directions for vision transformers.]]></summary>

paradigm, and realizes the collaborative model trained by distributed clients.
To accomplish an FL task, the task publisher needs to pay financial incentives
to the FL server and FL server offloads the task to the contributing FL
clients. It is challenging to design proper incentives for the FL clients due
to the fact that the task is privately trained by the clients. This paper aims
to propose a contract theory based FL task training model towards minimizing
incentive budget subject to clients being individually rational (IR) and
incentive compatible (IC) in each FL training round. We design a
two-dimensional contract model by formally defining two private types of
clients, namely data quality and computation effort. To effectively aggregate
the trained models, a contract-based aggregator is proposed. We analyze the
feasible and optimal contract solutions to the proposed contract model.
%Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework and contract
model can effective improve the generation accuracy of FL tasks. Experimental
results show that the generalization accuracy of the FL tasks can be improved
by the proposed incentive mechanism where contract-based aggregation is
applied.]]></summary>

high-quality videos from low-quality compressed ones. Among them, some restore
the missing details of each frame via exploring the spatiotemporal information
of neighboring frames. However, these methods usually suffer from a narrow
temporal scope, thus may miss some useful details from some frames outside the
neighboring ones. In this paper, to boost artifact removal, on the one hand, we
propose a Recursive Fusion (RF) module to model the temporal dependency within
a long temporal range. Specifically, RF utilizes both the current reference
frames and the preceding hidden state to conduct better spatiotemporal
compensation. On the other hand, we design an efficient and effective
Deformable Spatiotemporal Attention (DSTA) module such that the model can pay
more effort on restoring the artifact-rich areas like the boundary area of a
moving object. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the
existing ones on the MFQE 2.0 dataset in terms of both fidelity and perceptual

research, yet solving the wave equation is a major computational burden that
inhibits the progress of research. This is exaspirated by the fact that new

solutions using a recently developed machine learning paradigm called Neural
Operator. A trained Neural Operator can compute a solution in negligible time
for any velocity structure or source location. We develop a scheme to train
Neural Operators on an ensemble of simulations performed with random velocity
models and source locations. As Neural Operators are grid-free, it is possible
to evaluate solutions on higher resolution velocity models than trained on,
providing additional computational efficiency. We illustrate the method with
the 2D acoustic wave equation and demonstrate the method's applicability to
seismic tomography, using reverse mode automatic differentiation to compute
gradients of the wavefield with respect to the velocity structure. The
developed procedure is nearly an order of magnitude faster than using

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match
cross-modality pedestrian images, breaking through the limitation of
single-modality person ReID in dark environment. In order to mitigate the
impact of large modality discrepancy, existing works manually design various
two-stream architectures to separately learn modality-specific and
modality-sharable representations. Such a manual design routine, however,
highly depends on massive experiments and empirical practice, which is time
consuming and labor intensive. In this paper, we systematically study the
manually designed architectures, and identify that appropriately separating
Batch Normalization (BN) layers is the key to bring a great boost towards
cross-modality matching. Based on this observation, the essential objective is
to find the optimal separation scheme for each BN layer. To this end, we
propose a novel method, named Cross-Modality Neural Architecture Search
(CM-NAS). It consists of a BN-oriented search space in which the standard
optimization can be fulfilled subject to the cross-modality task. Equipped with
the searched architecture, our method outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts
in both two benchmarks, improving the Rank-1/mAP by 6.70%/6.13% on SYSU-MM01
and by 12.17%/11.23% on RegDB. Code is released at

collects samples from an unknown environment without the supervision of reward
signals, then is revealed with a reward and is asked to compute a corresponding
near-optimal policy. Existing approaches mainly concern the worst-case
scenarios, in which no structural information of the reward/transition-dynamics
is utilized. Therefore the best sample upper bound is
$\propto\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon^2)$, where $\epsilon>0$ is the
target accuracy of the obtained policy, and can be overly pessimistic. To
tackle this issue, we provide an efficient algorithm that utilizes a gap
parameter, $\rho>0$, to reduce the amount of exploration. In particular, for an
unknown finite-horizon Markov decision process, the algorithm takes only
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} (1/\epsilon \cdot (H^3SA / \rho + H^4 S^2 A) )$
episodes of exploration, and is able to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal policy for
a post-revealed reward with sub-optimality gap at least $\rho$, where $S$ is
the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $H$ is the length of
the horizon, obtaining a nearly \emph{quadratic saving} in terms of $\epsilon$.
We show that, information-theoretically, this bound is nearly tight for $\rho <
\Theta(1/(HS))$ and $H>1$. We further show that
$\propto\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$ sample bound is possible for $H=1$ (i.e.,
multi-armed bandit) or with a sampling simulator, establishing a stark
separation between those settings and the RL setting.]]></summary>

resulting in an increasingly unsustainable crop water demand from reduced
freshwater availability. Achieving food security while deploying water in a
sustainable manner will continue to be a major challenge necessitating careful
monitoring and tracking of agricultural water usage. Historically, monitoring
water usage has been a slow and expensive manual process with many
imperfections and abuses. Ma-chine learning and remote sensing developments
have increased the ability to automatically monitor irrigation patterns, but
existing techniques often require curated and labelled irrigation data, which
are expensive and time consuming to obtain and may not exist for impactful
areas such as developing countries. In this paper, we explore an end-to-end
real world application of irrigation detection with uncurated and unlabeled
satellite imagery. We apply state-of-the-art self-supervised deep learning
techniques to optical remote sensing data, and find that we are able to detect
irrigation with up to nine times better precision, 90% better recall and 40%
more generalization ability than the traditional supervised learning methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Useful information (UI) is an elusive concept in neural networks. A
quantitative measurement of UI is absent, despite the variations of UI can be
recognized by prior knowledge. The communication bandwidth of feature maps
decreases after downscaling operations, but UI flows smoothly after training
due to lower Nyquist frequency. Inspired by the low-Nyqusit-frequency nature of
UI, we propose the use of spectral roll-off points (SROPs) to estimate UI on
variations. The computation of an SROP is extended from a 1-D signal to a 2-D
image by the required rotation invariance in image classification tasks. SROP
statistics across feature maps are implemented as layer-wise useful information
estimates. We design sanity checks to explore SROP variations when UI
variations are produced by variations in model input, model architecture and
training stages. The variations of SROP is synchronizes with UI variations in
various randomized and sufficiently trained model structures. Therefore, SROP
variations is an accurate and convenient sign of UI variations, which promotes
the explainability of data representations with respect to frequency-domain
knowledge.]]></summary>

of low power consumption, high dynamic range, and high response speed for
visual perception and understanding on portable devices. Event-based learning
methods have recently achieved massive success on object recognition by
integrating events into dense frame-based representations to apply traditional
2D learning algorithms. However, these approaches introduce much redundant
information during the sparse-to-dense conversion and necessitate models with
heavy-weight and large capacities, limiting the potential of event cameras on
real-life applications. To address the core problem of balancing accuracy and
model complexity for event-based classification models, we (1) construct graph
representations for event data to utilize their sparsity nature better and
design a lightweight end-to-end graph neural network (EV-VGCNN) for
classification; (2) use voxel-wise vertices rather than traditional point-wise
methods to incorporate the information from more points; (3) introduce a
multi-scale feature relational layer (MFRL) to extract semantic and motion cues
from each vertex adaptively concerning its distances to neighbors.
Comprehensive experiments show that our approach advances state-of-the-art
classification accuracy while achieving nearly 20 times parameter reduction

As a simple corollary, the Littlestone dimension remains finite under some
natural modifications to the definition. A theme in these proofs is the
interaction of two abstract notions of majority, arising from measure, and from
rank or dimension; we prove that these densely often coincide and that this is
characteristic of Littlestone (stable) classes. The last section lists several

identifying dogs on roads) is crucial in safety-critical applications. Existing
approaches use images of unexpected objects from external datasets or require
additional training (e.g., retraining segmentation networks or training an
extra network), which necessitate a non-trivial amount of labor intensity or
lengthy inference time. One possible alternative is to use prediction scores of
a pre-trained network such as the max logits (i.e., maximum values among
classes before the final softmax layer) for detecting such objects. However,
the distribution of max logits of each predicted class is significantly
different from each other, which degrades the performance of identifying
unexpected objects in urban-scene segmentation. To address this issue, we
propose a simple yet effective approach that standardizes the max logits in
order to align the different distributions and reflect the relative meanings of
max logits within each predicted class. Moreover, we consider the local regions
from two different perspectives based on the intuition that neighboring pixels
share similar semantic information. In contrast to previous approaches, our
method does not utilize any external datasets or require additional training,
which makes our method widely applicable to existing pre-trained segmentation
models. Such a straightforward approach achieves a new state-of-the-art

for visual grounding, namely TransVG, to address the task of grounding a
language query to the corresponding region onto an image. The state-of-the-art
methods, including two-stage or one-stage ones, rely on a complex module with
manually-designed mechanisms to perform the query reasoning and multi-modal
fusion. However, the involvement of certain mechanisms in fusion module design,
such as query decomposition and image scene graph, makes the models easily
overfit to datasets with specific scenarios, and limits the plenitudinous
interaction between the visual-linguistic context. To avoid this caveat, we
propose to establish the multi-modal correspondence by leveraging transformers,
and empirically show that the complex fusion modules (\eg, modular attention
network, dynamic graph, and multi-modal tree) can be replaced by a simple stack
of transformer encoder layers with higher performance. Moreover, we
re-formulate the visual grounding as a direct coordinates regression problem
and avoid making predictions out of a set of candidates (\emph{i.e.}, region
proposals or anchor boxes). Extensive experiments are conducted on five widely
used datasets, and a series of state-of-the-art records are set by our TransVG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Human-designed data augmentation strategies have been replaced by
automatically learned augmentation policy in the past two years. Specifically,
recent work has empirically shown that the superior performance of the
automated data augmentation methods stems from increasing the diversity of
augmented data \cite{autoaug, randaug}. However, two factors regarding the
diversity of augmented data are still missing: 1) the explicit definition (and
thus measurement) of diversity and 2) the quantifiable relationship between
diversity and its regularization effects. To bridge this gap, we propose a
diversity measure called Variance Diversity and theoretically show that the
regularization effect of data augmentation is promised by Variance Diversity.
We validate in experiments that the relative gain from automated data
augmentation in test accuracy is highly correlated to Variance Diversity. An
unsupervised sampling-based framework, \textbf{DivAug}, is designed to directly
maximize Variance Diversity and hence strengthen the regularization effect.
Without requiring a separate search process, the performance gain from DivAug
is comparable with the state-of-the-art method with better efficiency.
Moreover, under the semi-supervised setting, our framework can further improve
the performance of semi-supervised learning algorithms compared to RandAugment,
making it highly applicable to real-world problems, where labeled data is
scarce. The code is available at

degradation at extremely low computational cost (e.g. 5M FLOPs on ImageNet
classification). We found that two factors, sparse connectivity and dynamic
activation function, are effective to improve the accuracy. The former avoids
the significant reduction of network width, while the latter mitigates the
detriment of reduction in network depth. Technically, we propose
micro-factorized convolution, which factorizes a convolution matrix into low
rank matrices, to integrate sparse connectivity into convolution. We also
present a new dynamic activation function, named Dynamic Shift Max, to improve
the non-linearity via maxing out multiple dynamic fusions between an input
feature map and its circular channel shift. Building upon these two new
operators, we arrive at a family of networks, named MicroNet, that achieves
significant performance gains over the state of the art in the low FLOP regime.
For instance, under the constraint of 12M FLOPs, MicroNet achieves 59.4\% top-1
accuracy on ImageNet classification, outperforming MobileNetV3 by 9.6\%. Source

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Domain adaptation (DA) paves the way for label annotation and dataset bias
issues by the knowledge transfer from a label-rich source domain to a related
but unlabeled target domain. A mainstream of DA methods is to align the feature
distributions of the two domains. However, the majority of them focus on the
entire image features where irrelevant semantic information, e.g., the messy
background, is inevitably embedded. Enforcing feature alignments in such case
will negatively influence the correct matching of objects and consequently lead
to the semantically negative transfer due to the confusion of irrelevant
semantics. To tackle this issue, we propose Semantic Concentration for Domain
Adaptation (SCDA), which encourages the model to concentrate on the most
principal features via the pair-wise adversarial alignment of prediction
distributions. Specifically, we train the classifier to class-wisely maximize
the prediction distribution divergence of each sample pair, which enables the
model to find the region with large differences among the same class of
samples. Meanwhile, the feature extractor attempts to minimize that
discrepancy, which suppresses the features of dissimilar regions among the same
class of samples and accentuates the features of principal parts. As a general
method, SCDA can be easily integrated into various DA methods as a regularizer
to further boost their performance. Extensive experiments on the cross-domain
benchmarks show the efficacy of SCDA.]]></summary>

assigns different magnitudes and weights to the selected transformations, which
are selected from a list of image transformations. Policies are evaluated using
a metric learning protocol to learn the optimal policy. The model converges
quickly and the cost of each policy iteration is minimal as we propose an
off-line caching technique to greatly reduce the computational cost of
extracting features from augmented images. Experimental results on large

importance to understand the matching mechanism of deep models for developing
reliable intelligent systems for many risky visual applications such as
surveillance and access control. However, most existing deep metric learning
methods match the images by comparing feature vectors, which ignores the
spatial structure of images and thus lacks interpretability. In this paper, we
present a deep interpretable metric learning (DIML) method for more transparent
embedding learning. Unlike conventional metric learning methods based on
feature vector comparison, we propose a structural matching strategy that
explicitly aligns the spatial embeddings by computing an optimal matching flow
between feature maps of the two images. Our method enables deep models to learn
metrics in a more human-friendly way, where the similarity of two images can be
decomposed to several part-wise similarities and their contributions to the
overall similarity. Our method is model-agnostic, which can be applied to
off-the-shelf backbone networks and metric learning methods. We evaluate our
method on three major benchmarks of deep metric learning including CUB200-2011,
Cars196, and Stanford Online Products, and achieve substantial improvements
over popular metric learning methods with better interpretability. Code is

semantically meaningful visual representations by solving pretext tasks.
However, prior work in SSL focuses on tasks like object recognition or
detection, which aim to learn object shapes and assume that the features should
be invariant to concepts like colors and textures. Thus, these SSL methods
perform poorly on downstream tasks where these concepts provide critical
information. In this paper, we present an SSL framework that enables us to
learn color and texture-aware features without requiring any labels during
training. Our approach consists of three self-supervised tasks designed to
capture different concepts that are neglected in prior work that we can select
from depending on the needs of our downstream tasks. Our tasks include learning
to predict color histograms and discriminate shapeless local patches and
textures from each instance. We evaluate our approach on fashion compatibility
using Polyvore Outfits and In-Shop Clothing Retrieval using Deepfashion,
improving upon prior SSL methods by 9.5-16%, and even outperforming some
supervised approaches on Polyvore Outfits despite using no labels. We also show
that our approach can be used for transfer learning, demonstrating that we can

anomaly detection community has attempted to obtain better features using
advances in deep self-supervised feature learning. Surprisingly, a very
promising direction, using pretrained deep features, has been mostly
overlooked. In this paper, we first empirically establish the perhaps expected,
but unreported result, that combining pretrained features with simple anomaly
detection and segmentation methods convincingly outperforms, much more complex,
state-of-the-art methods.

In order to obtain further performance gains in anomaly detection, we adapt
pretrained features to the target distribution. Although transfer learning
methods are well established in multi-class classification problems, the
one-class classification (OCC) setting is not as well explored. It turns out
that naive adaptation methods, which typically work well in supervised
learning, often result in catastrophic collapse (feature deterioration) and
reduce performance in OCC settings. A popular OCC method, DeepSVDD, advocates
using specialized architectures, but this limits the adaptation performance
gain. We propose two methods for combating collapse: i) a variant of early
stopping that dynamically learns the stopping iteration ii) elastic
regularization inspired by continual learning. Our method, PANDA, outperforms
the state-of-the-art in the OCC, outlier exposure and anomaly segmentation

entire environment is visible. However, RL approaches are challenged in complex
games like Starcraft II and in real-world environments where the entire

visual information, agents must choose where to look and how to optimally use
their limited visual information in order to succeed at the game. We verify
that with a relatively simple model the agent can learn where to look in
scenarios with a limited visual bandwidth. We develop a method for masking part
of the environment in Atari games to force the RL agent to learn both where to
look and how to play the game in order to study where the RL agent learns to

performance on a range of benchmark computer vision tasks, yet the benefits of
these techniques at extreme scale in complex production systems has been
relatively unexplored. We consider the case of a popular visual discovery
product, where these representations are trained with multi-task learning, from
use-case specific visual understanding (e.g. skin tone classification) to
general representation learning for all visual content (e.g. embeddings for
retrieval). In this work, we describe how we (1) generate a dataset with over a
billion images via large weakly-supervised pretraining to improve the
performance of these visual representations, and (2) leverage Transformers to
replace the traditional convolutional backbone, with insights into both system
and performance improvements, especially at 1B+ image scale. To support this
backbone model, we detail a systematic approach to deriving weakly-supervised
image annotations from heterogenous text signals, demonstrating the benefits of
clustering techniques to handle the long-tail distribution of image labels.
Through a comprehensive study of offline and online evaluation, we show that
large-scale Transformer-based pretraining provides significant benefits to
industry computer vision applications. The model is deployed in a production
visual shopping system, with 36% improvement in top-1 relevance and 23%
improvement in click-through volume. We conduct extensive experiments to better
understand the empirical relationships between Transformer-based architectures,
dataset scale, and the performance of production vision systems.]]></summary>

auto-encoder) and the graph convolutional network has attracted much attention
in clustering, in which the auto-encoder extracts the node attribute feature
and the graph convolutional network captures the topological graph feature.
However, the existing works (i) lack a flexible combination mechanism to
adaptively fuse those two kinds of features for learning the discriminative
representation and (ii) overlook the multi-scale information embedded at
different layers for subsequent cluster assignment, leading to inferior
clustering results. To this end, we propose a novel deep clustering method
named Attention-driven Graph Clustering Network (AGCN). Specifically, AGCN
exploits a heterogeneity-wise fusion module to dynamically fuse the node
attribute feature and the topological graph feature. Moreover, AGCN develops a
scale-wise fusion module to adaptively aggregate the multi-scale features
embedded at different layers. Based on a unified optimization framework, AGCN
can jointly perform feature learning and cluster assignment in an unsupervised
fashion. Compared with the existing deep clustering methods, our method is more
flexible and effective since it comprehensively considers the numerous and
discriminative information embedded in the network and directly produces the
clustering results. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results on commonly
used benchmark datasets validate that our AGCN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

KD methods have mainly considered two types of knowledge, namely the individual

holistic knowledge based on an attributed graph constructed among instances.
The holistic knowledge is represented as a unified graph-based embedding by
aggregating individual knowledge from relational neighborhood samples with
graph neural networks, the student network is learned by distilling the
holistic knowledge in a contrastive manner. Extensive experiments and ablation

then apply and compare multiple imitation learning algorithms with the

create opportunities for greater edge intelligence. In the domain of vision,
the ability to adapt a Convolutional Neural Network's (CNN) structure and
parameters to the input data distribution leads to systems with lower memory
footprint, latency and power consumption. However, due to the limited compute
resources and memory budget on edge devices, it is necessary for the system to
be able to predict the latency and memory footprint of the training process in
order to identify favourable training configurations of the network topology
and device combination for efficient network adaptation. This work proposes
perf4sight, an automated methodology for developing accurate models that
predict CNN training memory footprint and latency given a target device and
network. This enables rapid identification of network topologies that can be
retrained on the edge device with low resource consumption. With PyTorch as the
framework and NVIDIA Jetson TX2 as the target device, the developed models
predict training memory footprint and latency with 95% and 91% accuracy
respectively for a wide range of networks, opening the path towards efficient
network adaptation on edge GPUs.]]></summary>

actively studied to mitigate the domain gap between label-rich source data and
unlabeled target data. Despite these efforts, UDA still has a long way to go to
reach the fully supervised performance. To this end, we propose a Labeling Only
if Required strategy, LabOR, where we introduce a human-in-the-loop approach to
adaptively give scarce labels to points that a UDA model is uncertain about. In
order to find the uncertain points, we generate an inconsistency mask using the
proposed adaptive pixel selector and we label these segment-based regions to
achieve near supervised performance with only a small fraction (about 2.2%)
ground truth points, which we call "Segment based Pixel-Labeling (SPL)". To
further reduce the efforts of the human annotator, we also propose "Point-based
Pixel-Labeling (PPL)", which finds the most representative points for labeling
within the generated inconsistency mask. This reduces efforts from 2.2% segment
label to 40 points label while minimizing performance degradation. Through
extensive experimentation, we show the advantages of this new framework for
domain adaptive semantic segmentation while minimizing human labor costs.]]></summary>

without prior knowledge and how to encode them in real-time. We review the
progress across a range of gaze analysis tasks and applications to shed light
on these fundamental questions; identify effective methods in gaze analysis and
provide possible future directions. We analyze recent gaze estimation and
segmentation methods, especially in the unsupervised and weakly supervised
domain, based on their advantages and reported evaluation metrics. Our analysis
shows that the development of a robust and generic gaze analysis method still
needs to address real-world challenges such as unconstrained setup and learning
with less supervision. We conclude by discussing future research directions for

is crucial to model both motion patterns and diversity in the action video.
This paper proposes an Action Conditional Temporal Variational AutoEncoder
(ACT-VAE) to improve motion prediction accuracy and capture movement diversity.
ACT-VAE predicts pose sequences for an action clips from a single input image.
It is implemented as a deep generative model that maintains temporal coherence
according to the action category with a novel temporal modeling on latent
space. Further, ACT-VAE is a general action sequence prediction framework. When
connected with a plug-and-play Pose-to-Image (P2I) network, ACT-VAE can
synthesize image sequences. Extensive experiments bear out our approach can
predict accurate pose and synthesize realistic image sequences, surpassing

a two-way bridge in between. This structure leverages the advantage of
MobileNet at local processing and transformer at global interaction. And the

with recent works on vision transformer, the transformer in Mobile-Former
contains very few tokens (e.g. less than 6 tokens) that are randomly
initialized, resulting in low computational cost. Combining with the proposed
light-weight cross attention to model the bridge, Mobile-Former is not only
computationally efficient, but also has more representation power,
outperforming MobileNetV3 at low FLOP regime from 25M to 500M FLOPs on ImageNet
classification. For instance, it achieves 77.9\% top-1 accuracy at 294M FLOPs,
gaining 1.3\% over MobileNetV3 but saving 17\% of computations. When

imaging system using only a pinhole-sized aperture in place of a lens. They can
capture an infinite depth-of-field and offer greater freedom from optical
distortion over their lens-based counterparts. However, the inherent
limitations of a pinhole system result in lower sharpness from blur caused by
optical diffraction and higher noise levels due to low light throughput of the
small aperture, requiring very long exposure times to capture well-exposed
images. In this paper, we explore an image restoration pipeline using deep
learning and domain-knowledge of the pinhole system to enhance the pinhole
image quality through a joint denoise and deblur approach. Our approach allows
for more practical exposure times for hand-held photography and provides higher
image quality, making it more suitable for daily photography compared to other
lensless cameras while keeping size and cost low. This opens up the potential
of pinhole cameras to be used in smaller devices, such as smartphones.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the increasing popularity of deep learning on edge devices, compressing
large neural networks to meet the hardware requirements of resource-constrained
devices became a significant research direction. Numerous compression
methodologies are currently being used to reduce the memory sizes and energy
consumption of neural networks. Knowledge distillation (KD) is among such
methodologies and it functions by using data samples to transfer the knowledge
captured by a large model (teacher) to a smaller one(student). However, due to
various reasons, the original training data might not be accessible at the
compression stage. Therefore, data-free model compression is an ongoing
research problem that has been addressed by various works. In this paper, we
point out that catastrophic forgetting is a problem that can potentially be
observed in existing data-free distillation methods. Moreover, the sample
generation strategies in some of these methods could result in a mismatch
between the synthetic and real data distributions. To prevent such problems, we
propose a data-free KD framework that maintains a dynamic collection of
generated samples over time. Additionally, we add the constraint of matching
the real data distribution in sample generation strategies that target maximum
information gain. Our experiments demonstrate that we can improve the accuracy
of the student models obtained via KD when compared with state-of-the-art
approaches on the SVHN, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR100 datasets.]]></summary>

towards the training of machine learning and computer vision models. The first
dataset encompasses as the day of writing over 1.2 million images of
indoor-grown crops and weeds common to the Canadian Prairies and many US
states. The second dataset consists of over 540,000 images of plants imaged in
farmland. All indoor plant images are labelled by species and we provide rich
etadata on the level of individual images. This comprehensive database allows
to filter the datasets under user-defined specifications such as for example
the crop-type or the age of the plant. Furthermore, the indoor dataset contains
images of plants taken from a wide variety of angles, including profile shots,
top-down shots, and angled perspectives. The images taken from plants in fields
are all from a top-down perspective and contain usually multiple plants per
image. For these images metadata is also available. In this paper we describe
both datasets' characteristics with respect to plant variety, plant age, and
number of images. We further introduce an open-access sample of the
indoor-dataset that contains 1,000 images of each species covered in our
dataset. These, in total 14,000 images, had been selected, such that they form
a representative sample with respect to plant age and ndividual plants per

generation, it is still challenging to generate complex scenes containing
diverse, multiple objects and their interactions. Scene graphs, composed of
nodes as objects and directed-edges as relationships among objects, offer an
alternative representation of a scene that is more semantically grounded than
images. We hypothesize that a generative model for scene graphs might be able
to learn the underlying semantic structure of real-world scenes more
effectively than images, and hence, generate realistic novel scenes in the form
of scene graphs. In this work, we explore a new task for the unconditional
generation of semantic scene graphs. We develop a deep auto-regressive model
called SceneGraphGen which can directly learn the probability distribution over
labelled and directed graphs using a hierarchical recurrent architecture. The
model takes a seed object as input and generates a scene graph in a sequence of
steps, each step generating an object node, followed by a sequence of
relationship edges connecting to the previous nodes. We show that the scene
graphs generated by SceneGraphGen are diverse and follow the semantic patterns
of real-world scenes. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of the
generated graphs in image synthesis, anomaly detection and scene graph
completion.]]></summary>

temporal loss constraint is introduced based on the barycentric coordinate
interpolation. Besides, we propose a region-aware conditional normalization

environments, emphasising real-world deployment. Rather than requiring prior
knowledge of the agent or environment, the planner learns to model the state
transitions and rewards. To avoid the potentially hazardous trial-and-error of
reinforcement learning, we focus on differentiable planners such as Value
Iteration Networks (VIN), which are trained offline from safe expert
demonstrations. Although they work well in small simulations, we address two
major limitations that hinder their deployment. First, we observed that current
differentiable planners struggle to plan long-term in environments with a high
branching complexity. While they should ideally learn to assign low rewards to
obstacles to avoid collisions, we posit that the constraints imposed on the
network are not strong enough to guarantee the network to learn sufficiently
large penalties for every possible collision. We thus impose a structural
constraint on the value iteration, which explicitly learns to model any
impossible actions. Secondly, we extend the model to work with a limited
perspective camera under translation and rotation, which is crucial for real
robot deployment. Many VIN-like planners assume a 360 degrees or overhead view
without rotation. In contrast, our method uses a memory-efficient lattice map
to aggregate CNN embeddings of partial observations, and models the rotational
dynamics explicitly using a 3D state-space grid (translation and rotation). Our
proposals significantly improve semantic navigation and exploration on several
2D and 3D environments, succeeding in settings that are otherwise challenging
for this class of methods. As far as we know, we are the first to successfully

difficulty in finding accurate normals in complex regions or containing noisy

find that it is hard to determine the polynomial order of the fitting surface
and the fitting surface is sensitive to outliers. To address these problems, we
propose a simple yet effective solution that adds an additional offset
prediction to improve the quality of normal estimation. Furthermore, in order
to take advantage of points from different neighborhood sizes, a novel Cascaded
Scale Aggregation layer is proposed to help the network predict more accurate

progressive training pipeline to improve the ranking correlation of supernet.
Specifically, we carefully redesign the sub-networks in the supernet and map
the original supernet to a new one of high capacity. In addition, we gradually
add narrow branches of supernet to reduce the degree of weight sharing which
effectively alleviates the mutual interference between sub-networks. Finally,

a morphable model represented as an SDF. Next, it reconstructs facial geometry
details by optimizing a photometric loss with respect to the ground truth

does not require additional supervision from multiple views, lighting changes

neural architecture search, due to its promising results for image
classification. The main benefit of DARTS is the effectiveness achieved through
the weight-sharing one-shot paradigm, which allows efficient architecture

controlled manner. Although we demonstrate that the success of DARTS can be
extended from image classification to reconstruction, our experiments yield
three fundamental difficulties in the evaluation of DARTS-based methods: First,
the results show a large variance in all test cases. Second, the final
performance is highly dependent on the hyperparameters of the optimizer. And
third, the performance of the weight-sharing architecture used during training
does not reflect the final performance of the found architecture well. Thus, we
conclude the necessity to 1) report the results of any DARTS-based methods from
several runs along with its underlying performance statistics, 2) show the
correlation of the training and final architecture performance, and 3)
carefully consider if the computational efficiency of DARTS outweighs the costs

from single RGB images. To tackle such a severely ill-posed problem, we propose
a physically-interpretable, compact, efficient, and end-to-end learning-based
framework, namely AGD-Net. Precisely, by taking advantage of the imaging
process, we first formulate the problem explicitly based on the classic
gradient descent algorithm. Then, we design a lightweight neural network with a
multi-stage architecture to mimic the formed amended gradient descent process,
in which efficient convolution and novel spectral zero-mean normalization are
proposed to effectively extract spatial-spectral features for regressing an
initialization, a basic gradient, and an incremental gradient. Besides, based
on the approximate low-rank property of HS images, we propose a novel rank loss
to promote the similarity between the global structures of reconstructed and
ground-truth HS images, which is optimized with our singular value weighting
strategy during training. Moreover, AGD-Net, a single network after one-time
training, is flexible to handle the reconstruction with various spectral
response functions. Extensive experiments over three commonly-used benchmark
datasets demonstrate that AGD-Net can improve the reconstruction quality by
more than 1.0 dB on average while saving 67$\times$ parameters and 32$\times$

number of illustrators) to handle the different illustrators' styles, which

model parameters directly from depth images without the need to know
articulation model categories a priori. By contrast, existing methods that
learn articulation models from raw observations typically only predict point
estimates of the model parameters, which are insufficient to guarantee the safe
manipulation of articulated objects. Our core contributions include a novel
representation for distributions over rigid body transformations and
articulation model parameters based on screw theory, von Mises-Fisher
distributions, and Stiefel manifolds. Combining these concepts allows for an
efficient, mathematically sound representation that implicitly satisfies the
constraints that rigid body transformations and articulations must adhere to.
Leveraging this representation, we introduce a novel deep learning based
approach, DUST-net, that performs category-independent articulation model
estimation while also providing model uncertainties. We evaluate our approach
on several benchmarking datasets and real-world objects and compare its
performance with two current state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate
that DUST-net can successfully learn distributions over articulation models for
novel objects across articulation model categories, which generate point
estimates with better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods and effectively
capture the uncertainty over predicted model parameters due to noisy inputs.]]></summary>

a popular choice for solving classification and ranking problems. Without
appropriately tuned $\ell_2$ regularization or weight decay, such networks have
the tendency to make output scores (logits) and network weights large, causing
training loss to become too small and the network to lose its adaptivity
(ability to move around) in the parameter space. Although regularization is
typically understood from an overfitting perspective, we highlight its role in
making the network more adaptive and enabling it to escape more easily from
weights that generalize poorly. To provide such a capability, we propose a
method called Logit Attenuating Weight Normalization (LAWN), that can be
stacked onto any gradient-based optimizer. LAWN controls the logits by
constraining the weight norms of layers in the final homogeneous sub-network.
Empirically, we show that the resulting LAWN variant of the optimizer makes a
deep network more adaptive to finding minimas with superior generalization
performance on large-scale image classification and recommender systems. While
LAWN is particularly impressive in improving Adam, it greatly improves all
optimizers when used with large batch sizes]]></summary>

actions in untrimmed videos with only video-level labels. Currently, most
state-of-the-art WSTAL methods follow a Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) pipeline:
producing snippet-level predictions first and then aggregating to the
video-level prediction. However, we argue that existing methods have overlooked
two important drawbacks: 1) inadequate use of motion information and 2) the
incompatibility of prevailing cross-entropy training loss. In this paper, we
analyze that the motion cues behind the optical flow features are complementary
informative. Inspired by this, we propose to build a context-dependent motion
prior, termed as motionness. Specifically, a motion graph is introduced to
model motionness based on the local motion carrier (e.g., optical flow). In
addition, to highlight more informative video snippets, a motion-guided loss is
proposed to modulate the network training conditioned on motionness scores.
Extensive ablation studies confirm that motionness efficaciously models
action-of-interest, and the motion-guided loss leads to more accurate results.
Besides, our motion-guided loss is a plug-and-play loss function and is
applicable with existing WSTAL methods. Without loss of generality, based on
the standard MIL pipeline, our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance
on three challenging benchmarks, including THUMOS'14, ActivityNet v1.2 and

between people and objects from an image/video, which is beneficial for many
applications, such as robot grasping and action recognition. However, existing
methods mainly rely on the appearance feature of the objects to segment each
region of the image, which face the following two problems: (i) there are
multiple possible regions in an object that people interact with; and (ii)
there are multiple possible human interactions in the same object region. To
address these problems, we propose a Hand-aided Affordance Grounding Network
(HAGNet) that leverages the aided clues provided by the position and action of
the hand in demonstration videos to eliminate the multiple possibilities and
better locate the interaction regions in the object. Specifically, HAG-Net has
a dual-branch structure to process the demonstration video and object image.
For the video branch, we introduce hand-aided attention to enhance the region
around the hand in each video frame and then use the LSTM network to aggregate
the action features. For the object branch, we introduce a semantic enhancement
module (SEM) to make the network focus on different parts of the object
according to the action classes and utilize a distillation loss to align the
output features of the object branch with that of the video branch and transfer
the knowledge in the video branch to the object branch. Quantitative and

achieved stateof-the-art results for affordance grounding. The source code will

an AI agent to perceive its surrounding environment. While significant progress
has been achieved with expensive LiDAR point clouds, it poses a great challenge
for 3D object detection given only a monocular image. While there exist
different alternatives for tackling this problem, it is found that they are
either equipped with heavy networks to fuse RGB and depth information or
empirically ineffective to process millions of pseudo-LiDAR points. With
in-depth examination, we realize that these limitations are rooted in
inaccurate object localization. In this paper, we propose a novel and
lightweight approach, dubbed Progressive Coordinate Transforms (PCT) to
facilitate learning coordinate representations. Specifically, a localization
boosting mechanism with confidence-aware loss is introduced to progressively
refine the localization prediction. In addition, semantic image repre-
sentation is also exploited to compensate for the usage of patch proposals.
Despite being lightweight and simple, our strategy leads to superior
improvements on the KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset monocular 3D detection
benchmarks. At the same time, our proposed PCT shows great generalization to
most coordinate- based 3D detection frameworks. The code is available at:

Rendezvous and Optical Navigation (TRON) at Stanford University - the first
robotic testbed capable of validating machine learning algorithms for
spaceborne optical navigation. The TRON facility consists of two 6
degrees-of-freedom KUKA robot arms and a set of Vicon motion track cameras to
reconfigure an arbitrary relative pose between a camera and a target mockup
model. The facility includes multiple Earth albedo light boxes and a sun lamp
to recreate the high-fidelity spaceborne illumination conditions. After the
overview of the facility, this work details the multi-source calibration
procedure which enables the estimation of the relative pose between the object
and the camera with millimeter-level position and millidegree-level orientation
accuracies. Finally, a comparative analysis of the synthetic and TRON simulated
imageries is performed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pre-trained
on the synthetic images. The result shows a considerable gap in the CNN's

to rely on shortcut opportunities (SO) in the form of predictive and
easy-to-represent visual factors. This is known as shortcut learning and leads
to impaired generalization. In this work, we show that common DNNs also suffer
from shortcut learning when predicting only basic visual object factors of
variation (FoV) such as shape, color, or texture. We argue that besides
shortcut opportunities, generalization opportunities (GO) are also an inherent
part of real-world vision data and arise from partial independence between
predicted classes and FoVs. We also argue that it is necessary for DNNs to
exploit GO to overcome shortcut learning. Our core contribution is to introduce
the Diagnostic Vision Benchmark suite DiagViB-6, which includes datasets and
metrics to study a network's shortcut vulnerability and generalization
capability for six independent FoV. In particular, DiagViB-6 allows controlling
the type and degree of SO and GO in a dataset. We benchmark a wide range of
popular vision architectures and show that they can exploit GO only to a
limited extent.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To accommodate rapid changes in the real world, the cognition system of
humans is capable of continually learning concepts. On the contrary,
conventional deep learning models lack this capability of preserving previously
learned knowledge. When a neural network is fine-tuned to learn new tasks, its
performance on previously trained tasks will significantly deteriorate. Many
recent works on incremental object detection tackle this problem by introducing
advanced regularization. Although these methods have shown promising results,
the benefits are often short-lived after the first incremental step. Under
multi-step incremental learning, the trade-off between old knowledge preserving
and new task learning becomes progressively more severe. Thus, the performance
of regularization-based incremental object detectors gradually decays for
subsequent learning steps. In this paper, we aim to alleviate this performance
decay on multi-step incremental detection tasks by proposing a dilatable
incremental object detector (DIODE). For the task-shared parameters, our method
adaptively penalizes the changes of important weights for previous tasks. At
the same time, the structure of the model is dilated or expanded by a limited
number of task-specific parameters to promote new task learning. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Notably, compared with the
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves up to 6.0% performance
improvement by increasing the number of parameters by just 1.2% for each newly
learned task.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the availability of many datasets tailored for autonomous driving in
real-world urban scenes, semantic segmentation for urban driving scenes
achieves significant progress. However, semantic segmentation for off-road,
unstructured environments is not widely studied. Directly applying existing
segmentation networks often results in performance degradation as they cannot
overcome intrinsic problems in such environments, such as illumination changes.
In this paper, a built-in memory module for semantic segmentation is proposed
to overcome these problems. The memory module stores significant
representations of training images as memory items. In addition to the encoder
embedding like items together, the proposed memory module is specifically
designed to cluster together instances of the same class even when there are
significant variances in embedded features. Therefore, it makes segmentation
networks better deal with unexpected illumination changes. A triplet loss is
used in training to minimize redundancy in storing discriminative
representations of the memory module. The proposed memory module is general so
that it can be adopted in a variety of networks. We conduct experiments on the
Robot Unstructured Ground Driving (RUGD) dataset and RELLIS dataset, which are
collected from off-road, unstructured natural environments. Experimental
results show that the proposed memory module improves the performance of
existing segmentation networks and contributes to capturing unclear objects
over various off-road, unstructured natural scenes with equivalent
computational cost and network parameters. As the proposed method can be
integrated into compact networks, it presents a viable approach for
resource-limited small autonomous platforms.]]></summary>

for immersive visual effects and VR/AR experience. Recent neural advances still
lack the controllable and interactive bullet-time design ability for human
free-viewpoint rendering, especially under the real-time, dynamic and general
setting for our trajectory-aware task. To fill this gap, in this paper we
propose a neural interactive bullet-time generator (iButter) for
photo-realistic human free-viewpoint rendering from dense RGB streams, which
enables flexible and interactive design for human bullet-time visual effects.
Our iButter approach consists of a real-time preview and design stage as well
as a trajectory-aware refinement stage. During preview, we propose an
interactive bullet-time design approach by extending the NeRF rendering to a
real-time and dynamic setting and getting rid of the tedious per-scene
training. To this end, our bullet-time design stage utilizes a hybrid training
set, light-weight network design and an efficient silhouette-based sampling
strategy. During refinement, we introduce an efficient trajectory-aware scheme
within 20 minutes, which jointly encodes the spatial, temporal consistency and
semantic cues along the designed trajectory, achieving photo-realistic
bullet-time viewing experience of human activities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for convenient interactive

contrasts is usually acquired in a single study to assess different properties
of the same region of interest in human body. The whole acquisition process can
be accelerated by having one or more modalities under-sampled in the k-space.
Recent researches demonstrate that, considering the redundancy between
different contrasts or modalities, a target MRI modality under-sampled in the
k-space can be better reconstructed with the helps from a fully-sampled
sequence (i.e., the reference modality). It implies that, in the same study of
the same subject, multiple sequences can be utilized together toward the
purpose of highly efficient multi-modal reconstruction. However, we find that
multi-modal reconstruction can be negatively affected by subtle spatial
misalignment between different sequences, which is actually common in clinical
practice. In this paper, we integrate the spatial alignment network with
reconstruction, to improve the quality of the reconstructed target modality.
Specifically, the spatial alignment network estimates the spatial misalignment
between the fully-sampled reference and the under-sampled target images, and
warps the reference image accordingly. Then, the aligned fully-sampled
reference image joins the under-sampled target image in the reconstruction
network, to produce the high-quality target image. Considering the contrast
difference between the target and the reference, we particularly design the
cross-modality-synthesis-based registration loss, in combination with the
reconstruction loss, to jointly train the spatial alignment network and the
reconstruction network. Our experiments on both clinical MRI and multi-coil
k-space raw data demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our spatial
alignment network. Code is publicly available at

imperfections and abuses. Ma-chine learning and remote sensing developments
have increased the ability to automatically monitor irrigation patterns, but
existing techniques often require curated and labelled irrigation data, which
are expensive and time consuming to obtain and may not exist for impactful
areas such as developing countries. In this paper, we explore an end-to-end
real world application of irrigation detection with uncurated and unlabeled
satellite imagery. We apply state-of-the-art self-supervised deep learning
techniques to optical remote sensing data, and find that we are able to detect
irrigation with up to nine times better precision, 90% better recall and 40%
more generalization ability than the traditional supervised learning methods.]]></summary>

and the biological age of a person, may be a promising biomarker for
identifying neurodegenerative diseases. For this purpose accurate prediction is
important but the localisation of the areas that play a significant role in the
prediction is also crucial, in order to gain clinicians' trust and reassurance
about the performance of a prediction model. Most interpretability methods are
focused on classification tasks and cannot be directly transferred to
regression tasks. In this study, we focus on the task of brain age regression
from 3D brain Magnetic Resonance (MR) images using a Convolutional Neural
Network, termed prediction model. We interpret its predictions by extracting
importance maps, which discover the parts of the brain that are the most
important for brain age. In order to do so, we assume that voxels that are not
useful for the regression are resilient to noise addition. We implement a noise
model which aims to add as much noise as possible to the input without harming
the performance of the prediction model. We average the importance maps of the
subjects and end up with a population-based importance map, which displays the
regions of the brain that are influential for the task. We test our method on
13,750 3D brain MR images from the UK Biobank, and our findings are consistent
with the existing neuropathology literature, highlighting that the hippocampus
and the ventricles are the most relevant regions for brain aging.]]></summary>

proposes HandFoldingNet, an accurate and efficient hand pose estimator that

both global and joint-wise local features. Experimental results show that the

query expression in referring segmentation typically indicates the target
object by describing its relationship with others. Therefore, to find the
target one among all instances in the image, the model must have a holistic
understanding of the whole image. To achieve this, we reformulate referring
segmentation as a direct attention problem: finding the region in the image
where the query language expression is most attended to. We introduce
transformer and multi-head attention to build a network with an encoder-decoder
attention mechanism architecture that "queries" the given image with the
language expression. Furthermore, we propose a Query Generation Module, which
produces multiple sets of queries with different attention weights that
represent the diversified comprehensions of the language expression from
different aspects. At the same time, to find the best way from these
diversified comprehensions based on visual clues, we further propose a Query
Balance Module to adaptively select the output features of these queries for a
better mask generation. Without bells and whistles, our approach is
light-weight and achieves new state-of-the-art performance consistently on
three referring segmentation datasets, RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and G-Ref. Our code

we then automatically generate the HowToVQA69M dataset with 69M
video-question-answer triplets. To handle the open vocabulary of diverse

loss between a video-question multi-modal transformer and an answer

results, in particular for rare answers. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method
to significantly outperform the state of the art on MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA,

contributions is important as it facilitates reproducibility and allows
scrutiny of the published results. In lung nodule classification, for example,
many works report results on the publicly available LIDC dataset. In theory,
this should allow a direct comparison of the performance of proposed methods
and assess the impact of individual contributions. When analyzing seven recent
works, however, we find that each employs a different data selection process,
leading to largely varying total number of samples and ratios between benign
and malignant cases. As each subset will have different characteristics with
varying difficulty for classification, a direct comparison between the proposed
methods is thus not always possible, nor fair. We study the particular effect
of truthing when aggregating labels from multiple experts. We show that
specific choices can have severe impact on the data distribution where it may
be possible to achieve superior performance on one sample distribution but not
on another. While we show that we can further improve on the state-of-the-art
on one sample selection, we also find that on a more challenging sample
selection, on the same database, the more advanced models underperform with
respect to very simple baseline methods, highlighting that the selected data
distribution may play an even more important role than the model architecture.
This raises concerns about the validity of claimed methodological
contributions. We believe the community should be aware of these pitfalls and
make recommendations on how these can be avoided in future work.]]></summary>

but practical scenario where out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are contained in
the unlabeled data. While the mainstream technique seeks to completely filter
out the OOD samples for semi-supervised learning (SSL), we propose a novel
training mechanism that could effectively exploit the presence of OOD data for
enhanced feature learning while avoiding its adverse impact on the SSL. We
achieve this goal by first introducing a warm-up training that leverages all
the unlabeled data, including both the in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples.
Specifically, we perform a pretext task that enforces our feature extractor to
obtain a high-level semantic understanding of the training images, leading to
more discriminative features that can benefit the downstream tasks. Since the
OOD samples are inevitably detrimental to SSL, we propose a novel cross-modal
matching strategy to detect OOD samples. Instead of directly applying binary
classification, we train the network to predict whether the data sample is
matched to an assigned one-hot class label. The appeal of the proposed
cross-modal matching over binary classification is the ability to generate a
compatible feature space that aligns with the core classification task.
Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially lifts the
performance on open-set SSL and outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large
margin.]]></summary>

navigation or neighboring object recognition. Unfortunately, the ground is not
flat, as it features steep slopes; bumpy roads; or objects, such as curbs,
flower beds, and so forth. To tackle the problem, this paper presents a novel
ground segmentation method called \textit{Patchwork}, which is robust for
addressing the under-segmentation problem and operates at more than 40 Hz. In
this paper, a point cloud is encoded into a Concentric Zone Model-based
representation to assign an appropriate density of cloud points among bins in a
way that is not computationally complex. This is followed by Region-wise Ground
Plane Fitting, which is performed to estimate the partial ground for each bin.
Finally, Ground Likelihood Estimation is introduced to dramatically reduce
false positives. As experimentally verified on SemanticKITTI and rough terrain
datasets, our proposed method yields promising performance compared with the
state-of-the-art methods, showing faster speed compared with existing plane
fitting--based methods. Code is available:

auto-encoder) and the graph convolutional network has attracted much attention
in clustering, in which the auto-encoder extracts the node attribute feature
and the graph convolutional network captures the topological graph feature.
However, the existing works (i) lack a flexible combination mechanism to
adaptively fuse those two kinds of features for learning the discriminative
representation and (ii) overlook the multi-scale information embedded at
different layers for subsequent cluster assignment, leading to inferior
clustering results. To this end, we propose a novel deep clustering method
named Attention-driven Graph Clustering Network (AGCN). Specifically, AGCN
exploits a heterogeneity-wise fusion module to dynamically fuse the node
attribute feature and the topological graph feature. Moreover, AGCN develops a
scale-wise fusion module to adaptively aggregate the multi-scale features
embedded at different layers. Based on a unified optimization framework, AGCN
can jointly perform feature learning and cluster assignment in an unsupervised
fashion. Compared with the existing deep clustering methods, our method is more
flexible and effective since it comprehensively considers the numerous and
discriminative information embedded in the network and directly produces the
clustering results. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results on commonly

increasingly ubiquitous, there is growing interest in building automatic speech
recognition (ASR) systems that can run directly on-device; end-to-end (E2E)
speech recognition models such as recurrent neural network transducers and
their variants have recently emerged as prime candidates for this task. Apart
from being accurate and compact, such systems need to decode speech with low
user-perceived latency (UPL), producing words as soon as they are spoken. This
work examines the impact of various techniques - model architectures, training
criteria, decoding hyperparameters, and endpointer parameters - on UPL. Our
analyses suggest that measures of model size (parameters, input chunk sizes),
or measures of computation (e.g., FLOPS, RTF) that reflect the model's ability
to process input frames are not always strongly correlated with observed UPL.
Thus, conventional algorithmic latency measurements might be inadequate in
accurately capturing latency observed when models are deployed on embedded
devices. Instead, we find that factors affecting token emission latency, and
endpointing behavior have a larger impact on UPL. We achieve the best trade-off
between latency and word error rate when performing ASR jointly with
endpointing, while utilizing the recently proposed alignment regularization
mechanism.]]></summary>

including learning translation lexicons, cross-lingual transfer of language
processing tools, and automatic evaluation or analysis of translation outputs.
The great majority of past work on word alignment has worked by performing
unsupervised learning on parallel texts. Recently, however, other work has
demonstrated that pre-trained contextualized word embeddings derived from
multilingually trained language models (LMs) prove an attractive alternative,
achieving competitive results on the word alignment task even in the absence of
explicit training on parallel data. In this paper, we examine methods to marry
the two approaches: leveraging pre-trained LMs but fine-tuning them on parallel
text with objectives designed to improve alignment quality, and proposing
methods to effectively extract alignments from these fine-tuned models. We
perform experiments on five language pairs and demonstrate that our model can
consistently outperform previous state-of-the-art models of all varieties. In
addition, we demonstrate that we are able to train multilingual word aligners
that can obtain robust performance on different language pairs. Our aligner,

The degree of ambiguity of a regular language is defined in a natural way. A
language is k-ambiguous (respectively, boundedly, finitely, countably
ambiguous) if it is accepted by a k-ambiguous (respectively, boundedly,
finitely, countably ambiguous) automaton. Over finite words every regular
language is accepted by a deterministic automaton. Over finite trees every
regular language is accepted by an unambiguous automaton. Over $\omega$-words
every regular language is accepted by an unambiguous B\"uchi automaton and by a
deterministic parity automaton. Over infinite trees Carayol et al. showed that
there are ambiguous languages.

We show that over infinite trees there is a hierarchy of degrees of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moving towards human-like linguistic performance is often argued to require
compositional generalisation. Whether neural networks exhibit this ability is
typically studied using artificial languages, for which the compositionality of
input fragments can be guaranteed and their meanings algebraically composed.
However, compositionality in natural language is vastly more complex than this
rigid, arithmetics-like version of compositionality, and as such artificial
compositionality tests do not allow us to draw conclusions about how neural
models deal with compositionality in more realistic scenarios. In this work, we
re-instantiate three compositionality tests from the literature and reformulate
them for neural machine translation (NMT). The results highlight two main
issues: the inconsistent behaviour of NMT models and their inability to
(correctly) modulate between local and global processing. Aside from an
empirical study, our work is a call to action: we should rethink the evaluation
of compositionality in neural networks of natural language, where composing
meaning is not as straightforward as doing the math.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the domain of Morphology, Inflection is a fundamental and important task
that gained a lot of traction in recent years, mostly via SIGMORPHON's
shared-tasks. With average accuracy above 0.9 over the scores of all languages,
the task is considered mostly solved using relatively generic neural
sequence-to-sequence models, even with little data provided. In this work, we
propose to re-evaluate morphological inflection models by employing harder
train-test splits that will challenge the generalization capacity of the
models. In particular, as opposed to the na\"ive split-by-form, we propose a
split-by-lemma method to challenge the performance on existing benchmarks. Our
experiments with the three top-ranked systems on the SIGMORPHON's 2020
shared-task show that the lemma-split presents an average drop of 30 percentage
points in macro-average for the 90 languages included. The effect is most
significant for low-resourced languages with a drop as high as 95 points, but
even high-resourced languages lose about 10 points on average. Our results
clearly show that generalizing inflection to unseen lemmas is far from being
solved, presenting a simple yet effective means to promote more sophisticated
models.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, several Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) approaches have been
devised to represent entities and relations in dense vector space and employed
in downstream tasks such as link prediction. A few KGE techniques address
interpretability, i.e., mapping the connectivity patterns of the relations
(i.e., symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, and composition) to a geometric
interpretation such as rotations. Other approaches model the representations in
higher dimensional space such as four-dimensional space (4D) to enhance the
ability to infer the connectivity patterns (i.e., expressiveness). However,
modeling relation and entity in a 4D space often comes at the cost of
interpretability. This paper proposes HopfE, a novel KGE approach aiming to
achieve the interpretability of inferred relations in the four-dimensional
space. We first model the structural embeddings in 3D Euclidean space and view
the relation operator as an SO(3) rotation. Next, we map the entity embedding
vector from a 3D space to a 4D hypersphere using the inverse Hopf Fibration, in
which we embed the semantic information from the KG ontology. Thus, HopfE
considers the structural and semantic properties of the entities without losing
expressivity and interpretability. Our empirical results on four well-known
benchmarks achieve state-of-the-art performance for the KG completion task.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fine-tuned language models use greedy decoding to answer reading
comprehension questions with relative success. However, this approach does not
ensure that the answer is a span in the given passage, nor does it guarantee
that it is the most probable one. Does greedy decoding actually perform worse
than an algorithm that does adhere to these properties? To study the
performance and optimality of greedy decoding, we present exact-extract, a
decoding algorithm that efficiently finds the most probable answer span in the
context. We compare the performance of T5 with both decoding algorithms on
zero-shot and few-shot extractive question answering. When no training examples
are available, exact-extract significantly outperforms greedy decoding.
However, greedy decoding quickly converges towards the performance of
exact-extract with the introduction of a few training examples, becoming more
extractive and increasingly likelier to generate the most probable span as the
training set grows. We also show that self-supervised training can bias the
model towards extractive behavior, increasing performance in the zero-shot
setting without resorting to annotated examples. Overall, our results suggest
that pretrained language models are so good at adapting to extractive question
answering, that it is often enough to fine-tune on a small training set for the
greedy algorithm to emulate the optimal decoding strategy.]]></summary>

and the growing challenge of information overload limit awareness across the
literature, making it difficult to keep track of even narrow areas of interest,
let alone discover new ones. Algorithmic curation and recommendation, which
often prioritize relevance, can further reinforce these bubbles. In response,
we describe Bridger, a system for facilitating discovery of scholars and their
work, to explore design tradeoffs among relevant and novel recommendations. We
construct a faceted representation of authors using information extracted from
their papers and inferred personas. We explore approaches both for recommending
new content and for displaying it in a manner that helps researchers to
understand the work of authors who they are unfamiliar with. In studies with
computer science researchers, our approach substantially improves users'
abilities to do so. We develop an approach that locates commonalities and
contrasts between scientists---retrieving partially similar authors, rather
than aiming for strict similarity. We find this approach helps users discover
authors useful for generating novel research ideas of relevance to their work,
at a higher rate than a state-of-art neural model. Our analysis reveals that
Bridger connects authors who have different citation profiles, publish in
different venues, and are more distant in social co-authorship networks,
raising the prospect of bridging diverse communities and facilitating
discovery.]]></summary>

document ranking for information retrieval, which first pre-train a general
language model on an unlabeled large corpus and then conduct ranking-specific
fine-tuning on expert-labeled relevance datasets. Ideally, an IR system would
model relevance from a user-system dualism: the user's view and the system's
view. User's view judges the relevance based on the activities of "real users"
while the system's view focuses on the relevance signals from the system side,
e.g., from the experts or algorithms, etc. Inspired by the user-system
relevance views and the success of pre-trained language models, in this paper
we propose a novel ranking framework called Pre-Rank that takes both user's
view and system's view into consideration, under the pre-training and
fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, to model the user's view of relevance,
Pre-Rank pre-trains the initial query-document representations based on
large-scale user activities data such as the click log. To model the system's
view of relevance, Pre-Rank further fine-tunes the model on expert-labeled
relevance data. More importantly, the pre-trained representations, are
fine-tuned together with handcrafted learning-to-rank features under a wide and
deep network architecture. In this way, Pre-Rank can model the relevance by
incorporating the relevant knowledge and signals from both real search users
and the IR experts. To verify the effectiveness of Pre-Rank, we showed two
implementations by using BERT and SetRank as the underlying ranking model,
respectively. Experimental results base on three publicly available benchmarks
showed that in both of the implementations, Pre-Rank can respectively
outperform the underlying ranking models and achieved state-of-the-art
performances.]]></summary>

playing an increasingly important role in our daily lives. The key of
recommender systems is to predict how likely users will interact with items
based on their historical online behaviors, e.g., clicks, add-to-cart,
purchases, etc. To exploit these user-item interactions, there are increasing
efforts on considering the user-item interactions as a user-item bipartite
graph and then performing information propagation in the graph via Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). Given the power of GNNs in graph representation learning,
these GNN-based recommendation methods have remarkably boosted the
recommendation performance. Despite their success, most existing GNN-based
recommender systems overlook the existence of interactions caused by unreliable
behaviors (e.g., random/bait clicks) and uniformly treat all the interactions,
which can lead to sub-optimal and unstable performance. In this paper, we
investigate the drawbacks (e.g., non-adaptive propagation and non-robustness)
of existing GNN-based recommendation methods. To address these drawbacks, we
propose the Graph Trend Networks for recommendations (GTN) with principled

success in almost every NLP task. The evolution of these models started with
GPT and BERT. These models are built on the top of transformers,

universal language representations from large volumes of text data using
self-supervised learning and transfer this knowledge to downstream tasks. These

training of downstream models from scratch. In this comprehensive survey paper,
we initially give a brief overview of self-supervised learning. Next, we
explain various core concepts like pretraining, pretraining methods,
pretraining tasks, embeddings and downstream adaptation methods. Next, we
present a new taxonomy of T-PTLMs and then give brief overview of various
benchmarks including both intrinsic and extrinsic. We present a summary of
various useful libraries to work with T-PTLMs. Finally, we highlight some of
the future research directions which will further improve these models. We

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The item details page (IDP) is a web page on an e-commerce website that
provides information on a specific product or item listing. Just below the
details of the item on this page, the buyer can usually find recommendations
for other relevant items. These are typically in the form of a series of
modules or carousels, with each module containing a set of recommended items.
The selection and ordering of these item recommendation modules are intended to
increase discover-ability of relevant items and encourage greater user
engagement, while simultaneously showcasing diversity of inventory and
satisfying other business objectives. Item recommendation modules on the IDP
are often curated and statically configured for all customers, ignoring
opportunities for personalization. In this paper, we present a scalable
end-to-end production system to optimize the personalized selection and
ordering of item recommendation modules on the IDP in real-time by utilizing
deep neural networks. Through extensive offline experimentation and online A/B
testing, we show that our proposed system achieves significantly higher
click-through and conversion rates compared to other existing methods. In our
online A/B test, our framework improved click-through rate by 2.48% and
purchase-through rate by 7.34% over a static configuration.]]></summary>

of dense retrievers: i)~fragility to training data noise and ii)~requiring
large batches to robustly learn the embedding space. We use the recently
proposed Condenser pre-training architecture, which learns to condense
information into the dense vector through LM pre-training. On top of it, we
propose coCondenser, which adds an unsupervised corpus-level contrastive loss
to warm up the passage embedding space. Retrieval experiments on MS-MARCO,
Natural Question, and Trivia QA datasets show that coCondenser removes the need
for heavy data engineering such as augmentation, synthesis, or filtering, as

page are critical to the effectiveness and perception of a search system. A
search ranking system typically orders the results by independent
query-document scores to produce a slate of search results. However, such
unilateral scoring methods may fail to capture inter-document dependencies that
users are sensitive to, thus producing a sub-optimal slate. Further, in
practice, many real-world applications such as e-commerce search require
enforcing certain distributional criteria at the slate-level, due to business
objectives or long term user retention goals. Unilateral scoring of results
does not explicitly support optimizing for such objectives with respect to a
slate. Hence, solutions to the slate optimization problem must consider the
optimal selection and order of the documents, along with adherence to
slate-level distributional criteria. To that end, we propose a hybrid framework
extended from traditional slate optimization to solve the conditional slate
optimization problem. We introduce conditional sequential slate optimization
(CSSO), which jointly learns to optimize for traditional ranking metrics as
well as prescribed distribution criteria of documents within the slate. The
proposed method can be applied to practical real world problems such as
enforcing diversity in e-commerce search results, mitigating bias in top
results and personalization of results. Experiments on public datasets and
real-world data from e-commerce datasets show that CSSO outperforms popular
comparable ranking methods in terms of adherence to distributional criteria
while producing comparable or better relevance metrics.]]></summary>

and the growing challenge of information overload limit awareness across the
literature, making it difficult to keep track of even narrow areas of interest,
let alone discover new ones. Algorithmic curation and recommendation, which
often prioritize relevance, can further reinforce these bubbles. In response,
we describe Bridger, a system for facilitating discovery of scholars and their
work, to explore design tradeoffs among relevant and novel recommendations. We
construct a faceted representation of authors using information extracted from
their papers and inferred personas. We explore approaches both for recommending
new content and for displaying it in a manner that helps researchers to
understand the work of authors who they are unfamiliar with. In studies with
computer science researchers, our approach substantially improves users'
abilities to do so. We develop an approach that locates commonalities and
contrasts between scientists---retrieving partially similar authors, rather
than aiming for strict similarity. We find this approach helps users discover
authors useful for generating novel research ideas of relevance to their work,
at a higher rate than a state-of-art neural model. Our analysis reveals that
Bridger connects authors who have different citation profiles, publish in
different venues, and are more distant in social co-authorship networks,
raising the prospect of bridging diverse communities and facilitating
discovery.]]></summary>

initialize the user and item embeddings randomly. In this work, we propose a

LEPORID endows the embeddings with information regarding multi-scale
neighborhood structures on the data manifold and performs adaptive
regularization to compensate for high embedding variance on the tail of the
data distribution. Exploiting matrix sparsity, LEPORID embeddings can be
computed efficiently. We evaluate LEPORID in a wide range of neural
recommendation models. In contrast to the recent surprising finding that the
simple K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) method often outperforms neural recommendation
systems, we show that existing neural systems initialized with LEPORID often
perform on par or better than KNN. To maximize the effects of the
initialization, we propose the Dual-Loss Residual Recommendation (DLR2)
network, which, when initialized with LEPORID, substantially outperforms both

privacy (DP) using a general metric, has been widely studied to provide
rigorous privacy guarantees while keeping high utility. However, existing works
on extended DP are limited to few metrics, such as the Euclidean metric.
Consequently, they have only a small number of applications, such as
location-based services and document processing. In this paper, we propose a
couple of mechanisms providing extended DP with a different metric: angular
distance (or cosine distance). Our mechanisms are based on locality sensitive
hashing (LSH), which can be applied to the angular distance and work well for
personal data in a high-dimensional space. We theoretically analyze the privacy
properties of our mechanisms, and prove extended DP for input data by taking
into account that LSH preserves the original metric only approximately. We
apply our mechanisms to friend matching based on high-dimensional personal data
with angular distance in the local model, and evaluate our mechanisms using two
real datasets. We show that LDP requires a very large privacy budget and that
RAPPOR does not work in this application. Then we show that our mechanisms
enable friend matching with high utility and rigorous privacy guarantees based
on extended DP.]]></summary>

anonymous users. Specifically, SR-HetGNN first constructs heterogeneous graphs
containing various types of nodes according to the session sequence, which can
capture the dependencies among items, users, and sessions. Second, HetGNN
captures the complex transitions between items and learns the item embeddings
containing user information. Finally, to consider the influence of users' long

with the attentional network to obtain the final session embedding. SR-HetGNN

trade-off between exploiting partial knowledge of a user's preferences for
short-term satisfaction and exploring additional user preferences for long-term
coverage. Although exploration is indispensable for long success of a
recommender system, the exploration has been considered as the risk to decrease
user satisfaction. The reason for the risk is that items chosen for exploration
frequently mismatch with the user's interests. To mitigate this risk,
recommender systems have mixed items chosen for exploration into a
recommendation list, disguising the items as recommendations to elicit feedback
on the items to discover the user's additional tastes. This mix-in approach has
been widely used in many recommenders, but there is rare research, evaluating
the effectiveness of the mix-in approach or proposing a new approach for
eliciting user feedback without deceiving users. In this work, we aim to
propose a new approach for feedback elicitation without any deception and
compare our approach to the conventional mix-in approach for evaluation. To
this end, we designed a recommender interface that reveals which items are for
exploration and conducted a within-subject study with 94 MTurk workers. Our
results indicated that users left significantly more feedback on items chosen
for exploration with our interface. Besides, users evaluated that our new
interface is better than the conventional mix-in interface in terms of novelty,
diversity, transparency, trust, and satisfaction. Finally, path analysis show
that, in only our new interface, exploration caused to increase user-centric
evaluation metrics. Our work paves the way for how to design an interface,
which utilizes learning algorithm based on users' feedback signals, giving
better user experience and gathering more feedback data.]]></summary>

document ranking for information retrieval, which first pre-train a general
language model on an unlabeled large corpus and then conduct ranking-specific
fine-tuning on expert-labeled relevance datasets. Ideally, an IR system would
model relevance from a user-system dualism: the user's view and the system's
view. User's view judges the relevance based on the activities of "real users"
while the system's view focuses on the relevance signals from the system side,
e.g., from the experts or algorithms, etc. Inspired by the user-system
relevance views and the success of pre-trained language models, in this paper
we propose a novel ranking framework called Pre-Rank that takes both user's
view and system's view into consideration, under the pre-training and
fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, to model the user's view of relevance,
Pre-Rank pre-trains the initial query-document representations based on
large-scale user activities data such as the click log. To model the system's
view of relevance, Pre-Rank further fine-tunes the model on expert-labeled
relevance data. More importantly, the pre-trained representations, are
fine-tuned together with handcrafted learning-to-rank features under a wide and
deep network architecture. In this way, Pre-Rank can model the relevance by
incorporating the relevant knowledge and signals from both real search users
and the IR experts. To verify the effectiveness of Pre-Rank, we showed two
implementations by using BERT and SetRank as the underlying ranking model,
respectively. Experimental results base on three publicly available benchmarks
showed that in both of the implementations, Pre-Rank can respectively
outperform the underlying ranking models and achieved state-of-the-art
performances.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, several Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) approaches have been
devised to represent entities and relations in dense vector space and employed
in downstream tasks such as link prediction. A few KGE techniques address
interpretability, i.e., mapping the connectivity patterns of the relations
(i.e., symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, and composition) to a geometric
interpretation such as rotations. Other approaches model the representations in
higher dimensional space such as four-dimensional space (4D) to enhance the
ability to infer the connectivity patterns (i.e., expressiveness). However,
modeling relation and entity in a 4D space often comes at the cost of
interpretability. This paper proposes HopfE, a novel KGE approach aiming to
achieve the interpretability of inferred relations in the four-dimensional
space. We first model the structural embeddings in 3D Euclidean space and view
the relation operator as an SO(3) rotation. Next, we map the entity embedding
vector from a 3D space to a 4D hypersphere using the inverse Hopf Fibration, in
which we embed the semantic information from the KG ontology. Thus, HopfE
considers the structural and semantic properties of the entities without losing
expressivity and interpretability. Our empirical results on four well-known
benchmarks achieve state-of-the-art performance for the KG completion task.]]></summary>

(e.g., Uber or Lyft) have attracted much attention from both the academia and
the industry. In this paper, we consider an important dynamic car-hailing
problem, namely \textit{maximum revenue vehicle dispatching} (MRVD), in which
rider requests dynamically arrive and drivers need to serve as many riders as
possible such that the entire revenue of the platform is maximized. We prove
that the MRVD problem is NP-hard and intractable. In addition, the dynamic
car-hailing platforms have no information of the future riders, which makes the
problem even harder. To handle the MRVD problem, we propose a queueing-based
vehicle dispatching framework, which first uses existing machine learning
algorithms to predict the future vehicle demand of each region, then estimates
the idle time periods of drivers through a queueing model for each region. With
the information of the predicted vehicle demands and estimated idle time
periods of drivers, we propose two batch-based vehicle dispatching algorithms
to efficiently assign suitable drivers to riders such that the expected overall
revenue of the platform is maximized during each batch processing. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our

High-quality synthetic X-ray images can facilitate various applications such as
surgical image guidance systems and VR training simulations. However, it is
difficult to produce high-quality arbitrary view synthetic X-ray images in
real-time due to different CT slice thickness, high computational cost, and the
complexity of algorithms. Our goal is to generate high-resolution synthetic
X-ray images in real-time by upsampling low-resolution images with deep
learning-based super-resolution methods. Reference-based Super Resolution
(RefSR) has been well studied in recent years and has shown higher performance
than traditional Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). It can produce fine
details by utilizing the reference image but still inevitably generates some
artifacts and noise. In this paper, we introduce frequency domain loss as a
constraint to further improve the quality of the RefSR results with fine
details and without obvious artifacts. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first paper utilizing the frequency domain for the loss functions in the
field of super-resolution. We achieved good results in evaluating our method on

their exceptional ability to find complex relations in large datasets, the
strengthening of regulations on data ownership and privacy is causing
increasing difficulty in its application to medical data. In light of this,
Federated Learning has recently been proposed as a solution to train on private
data without breach of confidentiality. This conservation of privacy is
particularly appealing in the field of healthcare, where patient data is highly
confidential. However, many studies have shown that its assumption of
Independent and Identically Distributed data is unrealistic for medical data.
In this paper, we propose Personalized Federated Cluster Models, a hierarchical
clustering-based FL process, to predict Major Depressive Disorder severity from

we address problems caused by non-IID data, showing an accuracy increase in

that a wide DNN is often attracted by highly-degenerate critical points that

several years. Recently, one-stage HOI detection methods have become popular.
In this paper, we aim to explore the essential pros and cons of two-stage and
one-stage methods. With this as the goal, we find that conventional two-stage
methods mainly suffer from positioning positive interactive human-object pairs,
while one-stage methods are challenging to make an appropriate trade-off on
multi-task learning, i.e., object detection, and interaction classification.
Therefore, a core problem is how to take the essence and discard the dregs from
the conventional two types of methods. To this end, we propose a novel
one-stage framework with disentangling human-object detection and interaction
classification in a cascade manner. In detail, we first design a human-object
pair generator based on a state-of-the-art one-stage HOI detector by removing
the interaction classification module or head and then design a relatively
isolated interaction classifier to classify each human-object pair. Two cascade
decoders in our proposed framework can focus on one specific task, detection or
interaction classification. In terms of the specific implementation, we adopt a
transformer-based HOI detector as our base model. The newly introduced
disentangling paradigm outperforms existing methods by a large margin, with a
significant relative mAP gain of 9.32% on HICO-Det.]]></summary>

interesting items among them by novelty detection. Based on our observations,
we claim that, in an enterprise environment, there is a stable relation between
senders and receivers, but suspicious emails are commonly from unusual sources,
which can be detected through the rareness selection. We evaluate the
performance of Holmes in a real-world enterprise environment, in which it sends

high detection rate (output around 200 suspicious emails per day) and maintain

have been successfully used in various interactive learning systems such as
online advertising, recommender systems, and dynamic pricing. However, they
have yet to be widely adopted in high-stakes application domains, such as
healthcare. One reason may be that existing approaches assume that the
underlying mechanisms are static in the sense that they do not change over
different environments. In many real world systems, however, the mechanisms are
subject to shifts across environments which may invalidate the static
environment assumption. In this paper, we tackle the problem of environmental
shifts under the framework of offline contextual bandits. We view the
environmental shift problem through the lens of causality and propose
multi-environment contextual bandits that allow for changes in the underlying
mechanisms. We adopt the concept of invariance from the causality literature
and introduce the notion of policy invariance. We argue that policy invariance
is only relevant if unobserved confounders are present and show that, in that
case, an optimal invariant policy is guaranteed to generalize across
environments under suitable assumptions. Our results may be a first step
towards solving the environmental shift problem. They also establish concrete
connections among causality, invariance and contextual bandits.]]></summary>

features of filtered topological spaces in data visualization. In many
applications, computing distances between diagrams is essential; however,
computing these distances has been challenging due to the computational cost.
In this paper, we propose a persistence diagram hashing framework that learns a
binary code representation of persistence diagrams, which allows for fast
computation of distances. This framework is built upon a generative adversarial
network (GAN) with a diagram distance loss function to steer the learning
process. Instead of using standard representations, we hash diagrams into
binary codes, which have natural advantages in large-scale tasks. The training
of this model is domain-oblivious in that it can be computed purely from
synthetic, randomly created diagrams. As a consequence, our proposed method is
directly applicable to various datasets without the need for retraining the
model. These binary codes, when compared using fast Hamming distance, better
maintain topological similarity properties between datasets than other
vectorized representations. To evaluate this method, we apply our framework to
the problem of diagram clustering and we compare the quality and performance of
our approach to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we show the scalability of
our approach on a dataset with 10k persistence diagrams, which is not possible
with current techniques. Moreover, our experimental results demonstrate that
our method is significantly faster with the potential of less memory usage,
while retaining comparable or better quality comparisons.]]></summary>

to reduce the variance of the gradient estimators in practice. A control
variate is applied by subtracting a baseline function from the state-action
value estimates. Then the variance-reduced policy gradient presumably leads to
higher learning efficiency. Recent research on control variates with deep
neural net policies mainly focuses on scalar-valued baseline functions. The
effect of vector-valued baselines is under-explored. This paper investigates
variance reduction with coordinate-wise and layer-wise control variates
constructed from vector-valued baselines for neural net policies. We present
experimental evidence suggesting that lower variance can be obtained with such
baselines than with the conventional scalar-valued baseline. We demonstrate how
to equip the popular Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm with these
new control variates. We show that the resulting algorithm with proper
regularization can achieve higher sample efficiency than scalar control
variates in continuous control benchmarks.]]></summary>

to their capability to capture the potential relationships between entities.
However, most of the existing methods only construct a single global item graph
shared by all the users and regrettably ignore the diverse tastes between
different user groups. Inspired by the success of local models for
recommendation, this paper provides the first attempt to investigate multiple
local item graphs along with a global item graph for graph-based recommendation
models. We argue that recommendation on global and local graphs outperforms
that on a single global graph or multiple local graphs. Specifically, we
propose a novel graph-based recommendation model named GLIMG (Global and Local
IteM Graphs), which simultaneously captures both the global and local user
tastes. By integrating the global and local graphs into an adapted
semi-supervised learning model, users' preferences on items are propagated
globally and locally. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets
show that our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the art

often exceed the capacity of standard desktop GPUs. As a result, most deep
learning-based medical image analysis tasks require the input images to be
downsampled, often substantially, before these can be fed to a neural network.
However, downsampling can lead to a loss of image quality, which is undesirable
especially in reconstruction tasks, where the fine geometric details need to be
preserved. In this paper, we propose that high-resolution images can be
reconstructed in a coarse-to-fine fashion, where a deep learning algorithm is
only responsible for generating a coarse representation of the image, which
consumes moderate GPU memory. For producing the high-resolution outcome, we
propose two novel methods: learned voxel rearrangement of the coarse output and
hierarchical image synthesis. Compared to the coarse output, the
high-resolution counterpart allows for smooth surface triangulation, which can
be 3D-printed in the highest possible quality. Experiments of this paper are
carried out on the dataset of AutoImplant 2021
(https://autoimplant2021.grand-challenge.org/), a MICCAI challenge on cranial
implant design. The dataset contains high-resolution skulls that can be viewed
as 2D manifolds embedded in a 3D space. Codes associated with this study can be

decrease as the number of output spikes increases, and represents an important

using state-space representations. The classical notion of canonical
state-space realization is adapted in this paper to accommodate semi-infinite
inputs so that it can be used as a dimension reduction tool in the recurrent
networks setup. The so-called input forgetting property is identified as the
key hypothesis that guarantees the existence and uniqueness (up to system
isomorphisms) of canonical realizations for causal and time-invariant
input/output systems with semi-infinite inputs. Additionally, the notion of
optimal reduction coming from the theory of symmetric Hamiltonian systems is
implemented in our setup to construct canonical realizations out of input
forgetting but not necessarily canonical ones. These two procedures are studied
in detail in the framework of linear fading memory input/output systems.
Finally, the notion of implicit reduction using reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces (RKHS) is introduced which allows, for systems with linear readouts, to
achieve dimension reduction without the need to actually compute the reduced
spaces introduced in the first part of the paper.]]></summary>

when a programmer is faced with a programming task that they suspect can be

developer's already-written code but also the intent of the task the developer
is trying to achieve next, formulated in plain natural language. We call this
practice of enriching the code with natural language intent to facilitate its
completion natural language-guided programming.

To show that this idea is feasible we design, implement and benchmark a tool
that solves this problem in the context of a specific domain (data science) and
a specific programming language (Python). Central to the tool is the use of
language models trained on a large corpus of documented code. Our initial

localization have shown promise in finding software bugs. However, the accuracy
of these approaches heavily depends on their used bug reports. A significant
number of bug reports contain only plain natural language texts. According to
existing studies, IR-based approaches cannot perform well when they use these
bug reports as search queries. On the other hand, there is a piece of recent
evidence that suggests that even these natural language-only reports contain
enough good keywords that could help localize the bugs successfully. On one
hand, these findings suggest that natural language-only bug reports might be a
sufficient source for good query keywords. On the other hand, they cast serious
doubt on the query selection practices in the IR-based bug localization. In
this article, we attempted to clear the sky on this aspect by conducting an
in-depth empirical study that critically examines the state-of-the-art query
selection practices in IR-based bug localization. In particular, we use a
dataset of 2,320 bug reports, employ ten existing approaches from the
literature, exploit the Genetic Algorithm-based approach to construct optimal,
near-optimal search queries from these bug reports, and then answer three
research questions. We confirmed that the state-of-the-art query construction
approaches are indeed not sufficient for constructing appropriate queries (for
bug localization) from certain natural language-only bug reports although they
contain such queries. We also demonstrate that optimal queries and non-optimal
queries chosen from bug report texts are significantly different in terms of
several keyword characteristics, which has led us to actionable insights.
Furthermore, we demonstrate 27%--34% improvement in the performance of
non-optimal queries through the application of our actionable insights to them.]]></summary>

small subset of the multi-sensor, multi-channel information available,
motivating the need for fused multi-sensor representations. We propose a new
self-supervised training objective, Contrastive Sensor Fusion, which exploits
coterminous data from multiple sources to learn useful representations of every
possible combination of those sources. This method uses information common
across multiple sensors and bands by training a single model to produce a
representation that remains similar when any subset of its input channels is
used. Using a dataset of 47 million unlabeled coterminous image triplets, we
train an encoder to produce semantically meaningful representations from any
possible combination of channels from the input sensors. These representations
outperform fully supervised ImageNet weights on a remote sensing classification
task and improve as more sensors are fused. Our code is available at

on. This information leaks either through the model itself or through
predictions made by the model. Consequently, when the training data contains
sensitive attributes, assessing the amount of information leakage is paramount.
We propose a method to quantify this leakage using the Fisher information of
the model about the data. Unlike the worst-case a priori guarantees of
differential privacy, Fisher information loss measures leakage with respect to
specific examples, attributes, or sub-populations within the dataset. We
motivate Fisher information loss through the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound and delineate
the implied threat model. We provide efficient methods to compute Fisher
information loss for output-perturbed generalized linear models. Finally, we
empirically validate Fisher information loss as a useful measure of information
leakage.]]></summary>

the next element that the user clicks given the user's click history, the

a set of baseline methods based on the dataset. The experiments show that our
model achieves 48% and 71% accuracy (top-1 and top-3) for predicting next

leaves of a tree, expressing the relationships among these measurements. For
example, companies belong to industries, which in turn belong to ever coarser
divisions such as sectors; microbes are commonly arranged in a taxonomic
hierarchy from species to kingdoms; street blocks belong to neighborhoods,
which in turn belong to larger-scale regions. The problem of tree-based
aggregation that we consider in this paper asks which of these tree-defined
subgroups of leaves should really be treated as a single entity and which of
these entities should be distinguished from each other.

We introduce the "false split rate", an error measure that describes the
degree to which subgroups have been split when they should not have been. We
then propose a multiple hypothesis testing algorithm for tree-based
aggregation, which we prove controls this error measure. We focus on two main
examples of tree-based aggregation, one which involves aggregating means and
the other which involves aggregating regression coefficients. We apply this
methodology to aggregate stocks based on their volatility and to aggregate
neighborhoods of New York City based on taxi fares.]]></summary>

the regularity of the sought function. This result however is only a worst-case

project these features to 3D points, thus yielding general and rich point
representations. We additionally integrate an attention mechanism to aggregate
pixel features from multiple 2D views, such that visual occlusions are
implicitly taken into account. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our

of tackling graph analytical problems in various applications. Nevertheless,
with the wide-spreading practice of GNNs in high-stake decision-making
processes, there is an increasing societal concern that GNNs could make
discriminatory decisions that may be illegal towards certain demographic
groups. Although some explorations have been made towards developing fair GNNs,
existing approaches are tailored for a specific GNN model. However, in
practical scenarios, myriads of GNN variants have been proposed for different
tasks, and it is costly to train and fine-tune existing debiasing models for
different GNNs. Also, bias in a trained model could originate from training
data, while how to mitigate bias in the graph data is usually overlooked. In
this work, different from existing work, we first propose novel definitions and
metrics to measure the bias in an attributed network, which leads to the
optimization objective to mitigate bias. Based on the optimization objective,
we develop a framework named EDITS to mitigate the bias in attributed networks
while preserving useful information. EDITS works in a model-agnostic manner,
which means that it is independent of the specific GNNs applied for downstream
tasks. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the validity of the proposed bias metrics and the superiority of
EDITS on both bias mitigation and utility maintenance. Open-source

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardinality estimation is a fundamental but long unresolved problem in query
optimization. Recently, multiple papers from different research groups
consistently report that learned models have the potential to replace existing
cardinality estimators. In this paper, we ask a forward-thinking question: Are
we ready to deploy these learned cardinality models in production? Our study
consists of three main parts. Firstly, we focus on the static environment
(i.e., no data updates) and compare five new learned methods with eight
traditional methods on four real-world datasets under a unified workload
setting. The results show that learned models are indeed more accurate than
traditional methods, but they often suffer from high training and inference
costs. Secondly, we explore whether these learned models are ready for dynamic
environments (i.e., frequent data updates). We find that they cannot catch up
with fast data up-dates and return large errors for different reasons. For less
frequent updates, they can perform better but there is no clear winner among
themselves. Thirdly, we take a deeper look into learned models and explore when
they may go wrong. Our results show that the performance of learned methods can
be greatly affected by the changes in correlation, skewness, or domain size.
More importantly, their behaviors are much harder to interpret and often
unpredictable. Based on these findings, we identify two promising research
directions (control the cost of learned models and make learned models
trustworthy) and suggest a number of research opportunities. We hope that our
study can guide researchers and practitioners to work together to eventually
push learned cardinality estimators into real database systems.]]></summary>

a novel reinterpretation of the classical greedy algorithm using the
minorize-maximize (MM) principle. Based on that analogy, we propose a new class
of methods exploiting any plausible modular bound. In the context of optimal
experimental design for linear Bayesian inverse problems, we bound the
submodularity and supermodularity ratios when the underlying objective is based
on mutual information. We also develop novel modular bounds for the mutual
information in this setting, and describe certain connections to polyhedral

there are numerous bespoke interpretations of these definitions. Instead, we
provide a generalized set of group fairness definitions that unambiguously
extend to all machine learning environments while still retaining their
original fairness notions. We derive two fairness principles that enable such a
generalized framework. First, our framework measures outcomes in terms of
utilities, rather than predictions, and does so for both the decision-algorithm
and the individual. Second, our framework considers counterfactual outcomes,
rather than just observed outcomes, thus preventing loopholes where fairness
criteria are satisfied through self-fulfilling prophecies. We provide concrete

best matched with a set of text attributes given as query. The main challenge
of this task is the large modality gap between attributes and images. To reduce
the gap, we present a new loss for learning cross-modal embeddings in the
context of attribute-based person search. We regard a set of attributes as a
category of people sharing the same traits. In a joint embedding space of the
two modalities, our loss pulls images close to their person categories for
modality alignment. More importantly, it pushes apart a pair of person
categories by a margin determined adaptively by their semantic distance, where
the distance metric is learned end-to-end so that the loss considers importance
of each attribute when relating person categories. Our loss guided by the
adaptive semantic margin leads to more discriminative and semantically
well-arranged distributions of person images. As a consequence, it enables a
simple embedding model to achieve state-of-the-art records on public benchmarks

disparities across different protected groups, and approaches for adjusting the
algorithm output to reduce such disparities. In this paper, we propose to study
the problem of identification of the source of model disparities. Unlike
existing interpretation methods which typically learn feature importance, we
consider the causal relationships among feature variables and propose a novel
framework to decompose the disparity into the sum of contributions from
fairness-aware causal paths, which are paths linking the sensitive attribute
and the final predictions, on the graph. We also consider the scenario when the
directions on certain edges within those paths cannot be determined. Our
framework is also model agnostic and applicable to a variety of quantitative
disparity measures. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world data
sets are provided to show that our method can provide precise and comprehensive
explanations to the model disparities.]]></summary>

as the task of locating the content of the image referenced by the sentence. It
is a challenging task that has several real-world applications in
human-computer interaction, image-text reference resolution, and video-text
reference resolution. In the last years, several works have addressed this
problem with heavy and complex models that try to capture visual-textual

main components that focus on how to learn useful multi-modal features for
grounding and how to improve the predicted bounding box of the visual mention,
respectively. Finding the right learning balance between these two sub-tasks is
not easy, and the current models are not necessarily optimal with respect to
this issue. In this work, we propose a model that, although using a simple
multi-modal feature fusion component, is able to achieve a higher accuracy than
state-of-the-art models thanks to the adoption of a more effective loss
function, based on the classes probabilities, that reach, in the considered

deep learning optimizers while giving a concise overview of the wide range of

the following three points: (i) Optimizer performance varies greatly across
tasks. (ii) We observe that evaluating multiple optimizers with default
parameters works approximately as well as tuning the hyperparameters of a
single, fixed optimizer. (iii) While we cannot discern an optimization method
clearly dominating across all tested tasks, we identify a significantly reduced
subset of specific optimizers and parameter choices that generally lead to
competitive results in our experiments: Adam remains a strong contender, with
newer methods failing to significantly and consistently outperform it. Our
open-sourced results are available as challenging and well-tuned baselines for

visualization from being merely a way of presentation to an analysis and
discovery tool. A given visualization result is usually generated by applying a
series of transformations or filters to the underlying data. Nowadays, such
filters use deterministic algorithms to process the data. In this work, we aim
at extending this methodology towards data-driven filters, thus filters that
expose the abilities of pre-trained machine learning models to the
visualization system. The use of such data-driven filters is of particular
interest in fields like segmentation, classification, etc., where machine
learning models regularly outperform existing algorithmic approaches. To
showcase this idea, we couple Paraview, the well-known flow visualization tool,
with PyTorch, a deep learning framework. Paraview is extended by plugins that
allow users to load pre-trained models of their choice in the form of newly
developed filters. The filters transform the input data by feeding it into the
model and then provide the model's output as input to the remaining
visualization pipeline. A series of simplistic use cases for segmentation and
classification on image and fluid data is presented to showcase the technical
applicability of such data-driven transformations in Paraview for future
complex analysis tasks.]]></summary>

Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods involving the use of followon traces.
Despite the theoretical success of emphatic TD methods in addressing the
notorious deadly triad (Sutton and Barto, 2018) of off-policy RL, there are
still three open problems. First, the motivation for emphatic TD methods
proposed by Sutton et al. (2016) does not align with the convergence analysis
of Yu (2015). Namely, a quantity used by Sutton et al. (2016) that is expected
to be essential for the convergence of emphatic TD methods is not used in the
actual convergence analysis of Yu (2015). Second, followon traces typically
suffer from large variance, making them hard to use in practice. Third, despite
the seminal work of Yu (2015) confirming the asymptotic convergence of some
emphatic TD methods for prediction problems, there is still no finite sample
analysis for any emphatic TD method for prediction, much less control. In this
paper, we address those three open problems simultaneously via using truncated
followon traces in emphatic TD methods. Unlike the original followon traces,
which depend on all previous history, truncated followon traces depend on only
finite history, reducing variance and enabling the finite sample analysis of
our proposed emphatic TD methods for both prediction and control.]]></summary>

domain and then serve for this domain. However, in large commercial platforms,
it is often the case that the recommenders need to make click-through rate
(CTR) predictions for multiple business domains. Different domains have
overlapping user groups and items. Thus, there exist commonalities. Since the
specific user groups have disparity and the user behaviors may change in
various business domains, there also have distinctions. The distinctions result
in domain-specific data distributions, making it hard for a single shared model
to work well on all domains. To learn an effective and efficient CTR model to
handle multiple domains simultaneously, we present Star Topology Adaptive
Recommender (STAR). Concretely, STAR has the star topology, which consists of
the shared centered parameters and domain-specific parameters. The shared
parameters are applied to learn commonalities of all domains, and the
domain-specific parameters capture domain distinction for more refined
prediction. Given requests from different business domains, STAR can adapt its
parameters conditioned on the domain characteristics. The experimental result
from production data validates the superiority of the proposed STAR model.
Since 2020, STAR has been deployed in the display advertising system of
Alibaba, obtaining averaging 8.0% improvement on CTR and 6.0% on RPM (Revenue

Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). This paper initially reviews the main
challenges in sampling from the parameter posterior of a neural network via
MCMC. Such challenges culminate to lack of convergence to the parameter
posterior. Nevertheless, this paper shows that a non-converged Markov chain,
generated via MCMC sampling from the parameter space of a neural network, can
yield via Bayesian marginalization a valuable posterior predictive distribution
of the output of the neural network. Classification examples based on
multilayer perceptrons showcase highly accurate posterior predictive
distributions. The postulate of limited scope for MCMC developments in BNNs is
partially valid; an asymptotically exact parameter posterior seems less

assisting perception even under complex environments. In this paper, we work
towards developing a computer vision system able to segment objects by
exploiting motion cues, i.e. motion segmentation. We make the following
contributions: First, we introduce a simple variant of the Transformer to
segment optical flow frames into primary objects and the background. Second, we
train the architecture in a self-supervised manner, i.e. without using any
manual annotations. Third, we analyze several critical components of our method
and conduct thorough ablation studies to validate their necessity. Fourth, we
evaluate the proposed architecture on public benchmarks (DAVIS2016, SegTrackv2,
and FBMS59). Despite using only optical flow as input, our approach achieves
superior or comparable results to previous state-of-the-art self-supervised
methods, while being an order of magnitude faster. We additionally evaluate on
a challenging camouflage dataset (MoCA), significantly outperforming the other
self-supervised approaches, and comparing favourably to the top supervised

interest because they can avoid arbitrary parametric assumptions that are
common in variational inference. However, many ParVI approaches do not allow
arbitrary sampling from the posterior, and the few that do allow such sampling
suffer from suboptimality. This work proposes a new method for learning to
approximately sample from the posterior distribution. We construct a neural
sampler that is trained with the functional gradient of the KL-divergence
between the empirical sampling distribution and the target distribution,
assuming the gradient resides within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our
generative ParVI (GPVI) approach maintains the asymptotic performance of ParVI
methods while offering the flexibility of a generative sampler. Through
carefully constructed experiments, we show that GPVI outperforms previous
generative ParVI methods such as amortized SVGD, and is competitive with ParVI
as well as gold-standard approaches like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for fitting
both exactly known and intractable target distributions.]]></summary>

AI, and other high performance computing (HPC) fields to extract knowledge from
datasets. Each dataset requires tailored NN model architecture, but designing
structures by hand is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Neural
architecture search (NAS) automates the design of NN architectures. NAS
attempts to find well-performing NN models for specialized datsets, where
performance is measured by key metrics that capture the NN capabilities (e.g.,
accuracy of classification of samples in a dataset). Existing NAS methods are
resource intensive, especially when searching for highly accurate models for
larger and larger datasets.

To address this problem, we propose a performance estimation strategy that
reduces the resources for training NNs and increases NAS throughput without
jeopardizing accuracy. We implement our strategy via an engine called PEng4NN
that plugs into existing NAS methods; in doing so, PEng4NN predicts the final
accuracy of NNs early in the training process, informs the NAS of NN
performance, and thus enables the NAS to terminate training NNs early. We
assess our engine on three diverse datasets (i.e., CIFAR-100, Fashion MNIST,
and SVHN). By reducing the training epochs needed, our engine achieves
substantial throughput gain; on average, our engine saves 61% to 82% of
training epochs, increasing throughput by a factor of 2.5 to 5 compared to a
state-of-the-art NAS method. We achieve this gain without compromising
accuracy, as we demonstrate with two key outcomes. First, across all our tests,
between 74% and 97% of the ground truth best models lie in our set of predicted
best models. Second, the accuracy distributions of the ground truth best models
and our predicted best models are comparable, with the mean accuracy values
differing by at most .7 percentage points across all tests.]]></summary>

simulating physically accurate fog into clear-weather scenes, so that the
abundant existing real datasets captured in clear weather can be repurposed for
our task. Our contributions are twofold: 1) We develop a physically valid fog
simulation method that is applicable to any LiDAR dataset. This unleashes the
acquisition of large-scale foggy training data at no extra cost. These
partially synthetic data can be used to improve the robustness of several
perception methods, such as 3D object detection and tracking or simultaneous
localization and mapping, on real foggy data. 2) Through extensive experiments
with several state-of-the-art detection approaches, we show that our fog
simulation can be leveraged to significantly improve the performance for 3D
object detection in the presence of fog. Thus, we are the first to provide
strong 3D object detection baselines on the Seeing Through Fog dataset. Our

cancer-related deaths in 2018. A challenge in improving treatment is resistance
in genetically unstable cells. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
unsupervised machine learning on classifying treatment-resistant phenotypes in
heterogeneous tumors through analysis of single cell RNA sequencing(scRNAseq)
data with a pipeline and evaluation metrics. scRNAseq quantifies mRNA in cells
and characterizes cell phenotypes. One scRNAseq dataset was analyzed
(tumor/non-tumor cells of different molecular subtypes and patient
identifications). The pipeline consisted of data filtering, dimensionality
reduction with Principal Component Analysis, projection with Uniform Manifold
Approximation and Projection, clustering with nine approaches (Ward, BIRCH,
Gaussian Mixture Model, DBSCAN, Spectral, Affinity Propagation, Agglomerative
Clustering, Mean Shift, and K-Means), and evaluation. Seven models divided
tumor versus non-tumor cells and molecular subtype while six models classified
different patient identification (13 of which were presented in the dataset);
K-Means, Ward, and BIRCH often ranked highest with ~80% accuracy on the tumor
versus non-tumor task and ~60% for molecular subtype and patient ID. An
optimized classification pipeline using K-Means, Ward, and BIRCH models was
evaluated to be most effective for further analysis. In clinical research where
there is currently no standard protocol for scRNAseq analysis, clusters
generated from this pipeline can be used to understand cancer cell behavior and
malignant growth, directly affecting the success of treatment.]]></summary>

assisting perception even under complex environments. In this paper, we work
towards developing a computer vision system able to segment objects by
exploiting motion cues, i.e. motion segmentation. We make the following
contributions: First, we introduce a simple variant of the Transformer to
segment optical flow frames into primary objects and the background. Second, we
train the architecture in a self-supervised manner, i.e. without using any
manual annotations. Third, we analyze several critical components of our method
and conduct thorough ablation studies to validate their necessity. Fourth, we
evaluate the proposed architecture on public benchmarks (DAVIS2016, SegTrackv2,
and FBMS59). Despite using only optical flow as input, our approach achieves
superior or comparable results to previous state-of-the-art self-supervised
methods, while being an order of magnitude faster. We additionally evaluate on
a challenging camouflage dataset (MoCA), significantly outperforming the other
self-supervised approaches, and comparing favourably to the top supervised
approach, highlighting the importance of motion cues, and the potential bias
towards visual appearance in existing video segmentation models.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The large and still increasing popularity of deep learning clashes with a
major limit of neural network architectures, that consists in their lack of
capability in providing human-understandable motivations of their decisions. In
situations in which the machine is expected to support the decision of human
experts, providing a comprehensible explanation is a feature of crucial
importance. The language used to communicate the explanations must be formal
enough to be implementable in a machine and friendly enough to be
understandable by a wide audience. In this paper, we propose a general approach
to Explainable Artificial Intelligence in the case of neural architectures,
showing how a mindful design of the networks leads to a family of interpretable
deep learning models called Logic Explained Networks (LENs). LENs only require
their inputs to be human-understandable predicates, and they provide
explanations in terms of simple First-Order Logic (FOL) formulas involving such
predicates. LENs are general enough to cover a large number of scenarios.
Amongst them, we consider the case in which LENs are directly used as special
classifiers with the capability of being explainable, or when they act as
additional networks with the role of creating the conditions for making a
black-box classifier explainable by FOL formulas. Despite supervised learning
problems are mostly emphasized, we also show that LENs can learn and provide
explanations in unsupervised learning settings. Experimental results on several
datasets and tasks show that LENs may yield better classifications than
established white-box models, such as decision trees and Bayesian rule lists,
while providing more compact and meaningful explanations.]]></summary>

ranking decisions. These metrics often consider the membership of items to
particular groups, often identified using protected attributes such as gender

propose a sampling strategy and estimation technique for four fair ranking

plankton imaging offers a promising way forward to monitor plankton communities

classifiers have been successfully applied in various fields and provided
encouraging results when used to categorize marine plankton images. Here, we

lead to operational prescriptions for users. To this aim, we annotated into 35
classes over 17900 images of zooplankton and large phytoplankton colonies,
detected in Lake Greifensee (Switzerland) with the Dual Scripps Plankton
Camera. Our best models were based on transfer learning and ensembling, which
classified plankton images with 98% accuracy and 93% F1 score. When tested on
freely available plankton datasets produced by other automated imaging tools
(ZooScan, FlowCytobot and ISIIS), our models performed better than previously

of these methods in computer vision field. However, this progress could not
show any promises for fine-grained tasks such as Head Pose estimation. In this
article, we have tried to answer a question: How SSL can be used for Head Pose
estimation? In general, there are two main approaches to use SSL: 1. Using
pre-trained weights which can be done via weights pre-training on ImageNet or
via SSL tasks. 2. Leveraging SSL as an auxiliary co-training task besides of
Supervised Learning (SL) tasks at the same time. In this study, modified
versions of jigsaw puzzling and rotation as SSL pre-text tasks are used and the
best architecture for our proposed Hybrid Multi-Task Learning (HMTL) is found.
Finally, the HopeNet method as a baseline is selected and the impact of SSL
pre-training and ImageNet pre-training on both HMTL and SL are compared. The
error rate reduced by the HTML method up to 11% compare to the SL. Moreover,
HMTL method showed that it was good with all kinds of initial weights: random,
ImageNet and SSL pre-training weights. Also, it was observed, when puzzled
images are used for SL alone, the average error rate placed between SL and HMTL
which showed the importance of local spatial features compare to global spatial
features.]]></summary>

good results on action recognition datasets, they are computationally very
expensive and require many GFLOPs. While the GFLOPs of a 3D CNN can be
decreased by reducing the temporal feature resolution within the network, there
is no setting that is optimal for all input clips. In this work, we therefore
introduce a differentiable Similarity Guided Sampling (SGS) module, which can
be plugged into any existing 3D CNN architecture. SGS empowers 3D CNNs by
learning the similarity of temporal features and grouping similar features
together. As a result, the temporal feature resolution is not anymore static
but it varies for each input video clip. By integrating SGS as an additional
layer within current 3D CNNs, we can convert them into much more efficient 3D
CNNs with adaptive temporal feature resolutions (ATFR). Our evaluations show
that the proposed module improves the state-of-the-art by reducing the
computational cost (GFLOPs) by half while preserving or even improving the
accuracy. We evaluate our module by adding it to multiple state-of-the-art 3D

become a beneficial technology as it provides knowledge regarding the driver's
aggressiveness. Previous approaches achieved promising driver behavior
profiling performance through establishing statistical heuristics rules or
supervised learning-based models. Still, there exist limits that the
practitioner should prepare a labeled dataset, and prior approaches could not
classify aggressive behaviors which are not known a priori. In pursuit of
improving the aforementioned drawbacks, we propose a novel approach to driver
behavior profiling leveraging an unsupervised learning paradigm. First, we cast
the driver behavior profiling problem as anomaly detection. Second, we
established recurrent neural networks that predict the next feature vector
given a sequence of feature vectors. We trained the model with normal driver
data only. As a result, our model yields high regression error given a sequence
of aggressive driver behavior and low error given at a sequence of normal
driver behavior. We figured this difference of error between normal and
aggressive driver behavior can be an adequate flag for driver behavior
profiling and accomplished a precise performance in experiments. Lastly, we
further analyzed the optimal level of sequence length for identifying each
aggressive driver behavior. We expect the proposed approach to be a useful

deep learning area. Recent studies have empirically disclosed that utilizing
dual networks can enhance the performance of single network but without
theoretic proof. In this paper, we propose Cooperative Learning (CooL)
framework for noisy supervision that analytically explains the effects of
leveraging dual or multiple networks. Specifically, the simple but efficient
combination in CooL yields a more reliable risk minimization for unseen clean
data. A range of experiments have been conducted on several benchmarks with
both synthetic and real-world settings. Extensive results indicate that CooL
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Text-based image retrieval has seen considerable progress in recent years.
However, the performance of existing methods suffers in real life since the
user is likely to provide an incomplete description of an image, which often
leads to results filled with false positives that fit the incomplete
description. In this work, we introduce the partial-query problem and
extensively analyze its influence on text-based image retrieval. Previous
interactive methods tackle the problem by passively receiving users' feedback
to supplement the incomplete query iteratively, which is time-consuming and
requires heavy user effort. Instead, we propose a novel retrieval framework
that conducts the interactive process in an Ask-and-Confirm fashion, where AI
actively searches for discriminative details missing in the current query, and
users only need to confirm AI's proposal. Specifically, we propose an
object-based interaction to make the interactive retrieval more user-friendly
and present a reinforcement-learning-based policy to search for discriminative
objects. Furthermore, since fully-supervised training is often infeasible due
to the difficulty of obtaining human-machine dialog data, we present a
weakly-supervised training strategy that needs no human-annotated dialogs other
than a text-image dataset. Experiments show that our framework significantly
improves the performance of text-based image retrieval. Code is avaiable at

systems to recognize more and more classes of objects. However, current
intelligent systems often fail to correctly recognize previously learned
classes of objects when updated to learn new classes. It is widely believed
that such downgraded performance is solely due to the catastrophic forgetting
of previously learned knowledge. In this study, we argue that the class
confusion phenomena may also play a role in downgrading the classification
performance during continual learning, i.e., the high similarity between new
classes and any previously learned classes would also cause the classifier to
make mistakes in recognizing these old classes, even if the knowledge of these
old classes is not forgotten. To alleviate the class confusion issue, we
propose a discriminative distillation strategy to help the classify well learn
the discriminative features between confusing classes during continual
learning. Experiments on multiple natural image classification tasks support
that the proposed distillation strategy, when combined with existing methods,
is effective in further improving continual learning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adversarial patch attack against image classification deep neural networks
(DNNs), in which the attacker can inject arbitrary distortions within a bounded
region of an image, is able to generate adversarial perturbations that are
robust (i.e., remain adversarial in physical world) and universal (i.e., remain
adversarial on any input). It is thus important to detect and mitigate such
attack to ensure the security of DNNs.

This work proposes Jujutsu, a technique to detect and mitigate robust and
universal adversarial patch attack. Jujutsu leverages the universal property of
the patch attack for detection. It uses explainable AI technique to identify
suspicious features that are potentially malicious, and verify their
maliciousness by transplanting the suspicious features to new images. An
adversarial patch continues to exhibit the malicious behavior on the new images
and thus can be detected based on prediction consistency. Jujutsu leverages the
localized nature of the patch attack for mitigation, by randomly masking the
suspicious features to "remove" adversarial perturbations. However, the network
might fail to classify the images as some of the contents are removed (masked).
Therefore, Jujutsu uses image inpainting for synthesizing alternative contents
from the pixels that are masked, which can reconstruct the "clean" image for
correct prediction. We evaluate Jujutsu on five DNNs on two datasets, and show
that Jujutsu achieves superior performance and significantly outperforms
existing techniques. Jujutsu can further defend against various variants of the
basic attack, including 1) physical-world attack; 2) attacks that target
diverse classes; 3) attacks that use patches in different shapes and 4)
adaptive attacks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning to rank systems has become an important aspect of our daily life.
However, the implicit user feedback that is used to train many learning to rank
models is usually noisy and suffered from user bias (i.e., position bias).
Thus, obtaining an unbiased model using biased feedback has become an important
research field for IR. Existing studies on unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) can
be generalized into two families-algorithms that attain unbiasedness with
logged data, offline learning, and algorithms that achieve unbiasedness by
estimating unbiased parameters with real-time user interactions, namely online
learning. While there exist many algorithms from both families, there lacks a
unified way to compare and benchmark them. As a result, it can be challenging
for researchers to choose the right technique for their problems or for people
who are new to the field to learn and understand existing algorithms. To solve
this problem, we introduced ULTRA, which is a flexible, extensible, and easily
configure ULTR toolbox. Its key features include support for multiple ULTR
algorithms with configurable hyperparameters, a variety of built-in click
models that can be used separately to simulate clicks, different ranking model
architecture and evaluation metrics, and simple learning to rank pipeline
creation. In this paper, we discuss the general framework of ULTR, briefly
describe the algorithms in ULTRA, detailed the structure, and pipeline of the
toolbox. We experimented on all the algorithms supported by ultra and showed
that the toolbox performance is reasonable. Our toolbox is an important
resource for researchers to conduct experiments on ULTR algorithms with
different configurations as well as testing their own algorithms with the
supported features.]]></summary>

Without a proper analyse, the data are usually useless. The field of analysing
the data is called data mining. Unfortunately, the amount of data is quite
large: the data do not fit into main memory and the processing time can become
quite huge. Therefore, we need parallel data mining algorithms. One of the
popular and important data mining algorithm is the algorithm for generation of
so called frequent itemsets. The problem of mining of frequent itemsets can be
explained on the following example: customers goes in a store put into theirs
baskets some goods; the owner of the store collects the baskets and wants to
know the set of goods that are bought together in at least p% of the baskets.
Currently, the sequential algorithms for mining of frequent itemsets are quite
good in the means of performance. However, the parallel algorithms for mining
of frequent itemsets still do not achieve good speedup. In this thesis, we
develop a parallel method for mining of frequent itemsets that can be used for
an arbitrary depth first search sequential algorithms on a distributed memory
parallel computer. Our method achieves speedup of ~ 6 on 10 processors. The
method is based on an approximate estimation of processor load from a database
sample - however it always computes the set of frequent itemsets from the whole
database. In this thesis, we show a theory underlying our method and show the
performance of the estimation process.]]></summary>

verification of DNN models. Watermarking should be robust against watermark
removal attacks that derive a surrogate model that evades provenance
verification. Many watermarking schemes that claim robustness have been
proposed, but their robustness is only validated in isolation against a
relatively small set of attacks. There is no systematic, empirical evaluation
of these claims against a common, comprehensive set of removal attacks. This
uncertainty about a watermarking scheme's robustness causes difficulty to trust
their deployment in practice. In this paper, we evaluate whether recently
proposed watermarking schemes that claim robustness are robust against a large
set of removal attacks. We survey methods from the literature that (i) are
known removal attacks, (ii) derive surrogate models but have not been evaluated
as removal attacks, and (iii) novel removal attacks. Weight shifting and smooth
retraining are novel removal attacks adapted to the DNN watermarking schemes
surveyed in this paper. We propose taxonomies for watermarking schemes and
removal attacks. Our empirical evaluation includes an ablation study over sets
of parameters for each attack and watermarking scheme on the CIFAR-10 and
ImageNet datasets. Surprisingly, none of the surveyed watermarking schemes is
robust in practice. We find that schemes fail to withstand adaptive attacks and
known methods for deriving surrogate models that have not been evaluated as
removal attacks. This points to intrinsic flaws in how robustness is currently
evaluated. We show that watermarking schemes need to be evaluated against a
more extensive set of removal attacks with a more realistic adversary model.
Our source code and a complete dataset of evaluation results are publicly
available, which allows to independently verify our conclusions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Universal adversarial attacks, which hinder most deep neural network (DNN)
tasks using only a small single perturbation called a universal adversarial
perturbation (UAP), is a realistic security threat to the practical application
of a DNN. In particular, such attacks cause serious problems in medical
imaging. Given that computer-based systems are generally operated under a
black-box condition in which only queries on inputs are allowed and outputs are
accessible, the impact of UAPs seems to be limited because well-used algorithms
for generating UAPs are limited to a white-box condition in which adversaries
can access the model weights and loss gradients. Nevertheless, we demonstrate
that UAPs are easily generatable using a relatively small dataset under
black-box conditions. In particular, we propose a method for generating UAPs
using a simple hill-climbing search based only on DNN outputs and demonstrate
the validity of the proposed method using representative DNN-based medical
image classifications. Black-box UAPs can be used to conduct both non-targeted
and targeted attacks. Overall, the black-box UAPs showed high attack success
rates (40% to 90%), although some of them had relatively low success rates
because the method only utilizes limited information to generate UAPs. The
vulnerability of black-box UAPs was observed in several model architectures.
The results indicate that adversaries can also generate UAPs through a simple
procedure under the black-box condition to foil or control DNN-based medical
image diagnoses, and that UAPs are a more realistic security threat.]]></summary>

performance drop in the presence of domain differences between source and

not necessarily translate to high classification accuracy on the target

problem by boosting the generalization capability of the model. Specifically,
we teach the model to capture broader variations of the feature distributions
with a novel noise-enhanced supervised autoencoder (NSAE). NSAE trains the
model by jointly reconstructing inputs and predicting the labels of inputs as
well as their reconstructed pairs. Theoretical analysis based on intra-class
correlation (ICC) shows that the feature embeddings learned from NSAE have
stronger discrimination and generalization abilities in the target domain. We
also take advantage of NSAE structure and propose a two-step fine-tuning
procedure that achieves better adaption and improves classification performance
in the target domain. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results
show that our proposed method consistently outperforms SOTA methods under

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Autonomous driving in multi-agent and dynamic traffic scenarios is
challenging, where the behaviors of other road agents are uncertain and hard to
model explicitly, and the ego-vehicle should apply complicated negotiation
skills with them to achieve both safe and efficient driving in various
settings, such as giving way, merging and taking turns. Traditional planning
methods are largely rule-based and scale poorly in these complex dynamic
scenarios, often leading to reactive or even overly conservative behaviors.
Therefore, they require tedious human efforts to maintain workability.
Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown promising results with better
generalization capability but less hand engineering effort. However, they are
either implemented with supervised imitation learning (IL) that suffers from
the dataset bias and distribution mismatch problems, or trained with deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) but focus on one specific traffic scenario. In
this work, we propose DQ-GAT to achieve scalable and proactive autonomous
driving, where graph attention-based networks are used to implicitly model
interactions, and asynchronous deep Q-learning is employed to train the network
end-to-end in an unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments through a
high-fidelity driving simulation show that our method can better trade-off
safety and efficiency in both seen and unseen scenarios, achieving higher goal
success rates than the baselines (at most 4.7$\times$) with comparable task
completion time. Demonstration videos are available at

neurodegenerative disease, that causes approximately 350 deaths in the United
States every year. In specific, it is a prion disease that is caused by a
misfolded prion protein, termed $PrP^{Sc}$, which is the infectious form of the
prion protein $PrP^{C}$. Rather than being recycled by the body, the $PrP^{Sc}$
aggregates in the brain as plaques, leading to neurodegeneration of surrounding
cells and the spongiform characteristics of the pathology. However, there has
been very little research done into factors that can affect one's chances of
acquiring $PrP^{Sc}$. In this paper, Elastic Net Regression, Long Short-Term
Memory Recurrent Neural Network Architectures, and Random Forest have been used
to predict Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Levels in the United States. New variables
were created as data for the models to use on the basis of common factors that
are known to affect CJD, such as soil, food, and water quality. Based on the
root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE), and mean absolute error
(MAE) values, the study reveals the high impact of unhealthy lifestyle choices,
CO$_{2}$ Levels, Pesticide Usage, and Potash K$_{2}$O Usage on CJD Levels. In
doing so, the study highlights new avenues of research for CJD prevention and
detection, as well as potential causes.]]></summary>

techniques for predicting phosphorylation are time-consuming, costly, and
error-prone. By the way, computational methods have replaced these techniques.
These days, a vast amount of phosphorylation data is publicly accessible
through many online databases. In this study, at first, all datasets of PTMs
that include phosphorylation sites (p-sites) were comprehensively reviewed.
Furthermore, we showed that there are basically two main approaches for
phosphorylation prediction by machine learning: End-to-End and conventional. We

sequence modeling. Besides the quadratic computational and memory complexity
w.r.t the sequence length, the self-attention mechanism only processes
information at the same scale, i.e., all attention heads are in the same
resolution, resulting in the limited power of the Transformer. To remedy this,
we propose a novel and efficient structure named Adaptive Multi-Resolution
Attention (AdaMRA for short), which scales linearly to sequence length in terms
of time and space. Specifically, we leverage a multi-resolution multi-head
attention mechanism, enabling attention heads to capture long-range contextual
information in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Moreover, to capture the potential
relations between query representation and clues of different attention
granularities, we leave the decision of which resolution of attention to use to
query, which further improves the model's capacity compared to vanilla
Transformer. In an effort to reduce complexity, we adopt kernel attention
without degrading the performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model by achieving a
state-of-the-art performance-efficiency-memory trade-off. To facilitate AdaMRA
utilization by the scientific community, the code implementation will be made

(LiNGAM) that determines the causal order among variables from a dataset when
the variables are expressed by a set of linear equations, including noise. In
particular, we assume that the variables are binary. The existing LiNGAM
assumes that no confounding is present, which is restrictive in practice. Based
on the concept of independent component analysis (ICA), this paper proposes an
extended framework in which the mutual information among the noises is
minimized. Another significant contribution is to reduce the realization of the
shortest path problem. The distance between each pair of nodes expresses an
associated mutual information value, and the path with the minimum sum (KL
divergence) is sought. Although $p!$ mutual information values should be
compared, this paper dramatically reduces the computation when no confounding
is present. The proposed algorithm finds the globally optimal solution, while
the existing locally greedily seek the order based on hypothesis testing. We
use the best estimator in the sense of Bayes/MDL that correctly detects
independence for mutual information estimation. Experiments using artificial
and actual data show that the proposed version of LiNGAM achieves significantly
better performance, particularly when confounding is present.]]></summary>

shaping people's health. In clinical research studies, especially comparative
effectiveness studies, failure to adjust for SBDoH factors will potentially
cause confounding issues and misclassification errors in either statistical
analyses and machine learning-based models. However, there are limited studies
to examine SBDoH factors in clinical outcomes due to the lack of structured
SBDoH information in current electronic health record (EHR) systems, while much
of the SBDoH information is documented in clinical narratives. Natural language
processing (NLP) is thus the key technology to extract such information from
unstructured clinical text. However, there is not a mature clinical NLP system
focusing on SBDoH. In this study, we examined two state-of-the-art
transformer-based NLP models, including BERT and RoBERTa, to extract SBDoH
concepts from clinical narratives, applied the best performing model to extract
SBDoH concepts on a lung cancer screening patient cohort, and examined the
difference of SBDoH information between NLP extracted results and structured
EHRs (SBDoH information captured in standard vocabularies such as the
International Classification of Diseases codes). The experimental results show
that the BERT-based NLP model achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of
0.8791 and 0.8999, respectively. The comparison between NLP extracted SBDoH
information and structured EHRs in the lung cancer patient cohort of 864
patients with 161,933 various types of clinical notes showed that much more
detailed information about smoking, education, and employment were only
captured in clinical narratives and that it is necessary to use both clinical
narratives and structured EHRs to construct a more complete picture of
patients' SBDoH factors.]]></summary>

$\varepsilon$, supposing we are given copies of its Gibbs state
$\rho=\exp(-\beta H)/\operatorname{Tr}(\exp(-\beta H))$ at a known inverse
temperature $\beta$. Anshu, Arunachalam, Kuwahara, and Soleimanifar (Nature
Physics, 2021) recently studied the sample complexity (number of copies of
$\rho$ needed) of this problem for geometrically local $N$-qubit Hamiltonians.
In the high-temperature (low $\beta$) regime, their algorithm has sample
complexity poly$(N, 1/\beta,1/\varepsilon)$ and can be implemented with
polynomial, but suboptimal, time complexity.

In this paper, we study the same question for a more general class of
Hamiltonians. We show how to learn the coefficients of a Hamiltonian to error
$\varepsilon$ with sample complexity $S = O(\log N/(\beta\varepsilon)^{2})$ and
time complexity linear in the sample size, $O(S N)$. Furthermore, we prove a
matching lower bound showing that our algorithm's sample complexity is optimal,
and hence our time complexity is also optimal.

In the appendix, we show that virtually the same algorithm can be used to
learn $H$ from a real-time evolution unitary $e^{-it H}$ in a small $t$ regime
with similar sample and time complexity.]]></summary>

approximation of two-layer neural networks. We first consider the case of
single neuron and show that the linear approximability, quantified by the
Kolmogorov width, is controlled by the eigenvalue decay of an associate kernel.
Then, we show that similar results also hold for two-layer neural networks.
This spectral-based approach allows us to obtain upper bounds, lower bounds,
and explicit hard examples in a united manner. In particular, these bounds
imply that for networks activated by smooth functions, restricting the norms of
inner-layer weights may significantly impair the expressiveness. By contrast,
for non-smooth activation functions, such as ReLU, the network expressiveness
is independent of the inner-layer weight norms. In addition, we prove that for
a family of non-smooth activation functions, including ReLU, approximating any
single neuron with random features suffers from the \emph{curse of
dimensionality}. This provides an explicit separation of expressiveness between
neural networks and random feature models.]]></summary>

the observed data. Given the fact that the generative distribution may be
complex and intractable, deep latent variable models use probabilistic
frameworks to learn more expressive joint probability distributions over the

distributions over sequential data without any supervision is a difficult task
for deep generative models. Ordinary Differential Equation Variational
Auto-Encoder (ODE2VAE) is a deep latent variable model that aims to learn

low-dimensional representations. ODE2VAE infers continuous latent dynamics of
the high-dimensional input in a low-dimensional hierarchical latent space. The
hierarchical organization of the continuous latent space embeds a
physics-guided inductive bias in the model. In this paper, we analyze the
latent representations inferred by the ODE2VAE model over three different
physical motion datasets: bouncing balls, projectile motion, and simple

attribution methods for multiple vision tasks. Its simplicity and effectiveness
have led to wide applications in the explanation of visual predictions and
weakly-supervised localization tasks. However, CAM has its own shortcomings.
The computation of attribution maps relies on ad-hoc calibration steps that are
not part of the training computational graph, making it difficult for us to
understand the real meaning of the attribution values. In this paper, we
improve CAM by explicitly incorporating a latent variable encoding the location
of the cue for recognition in the formulation, thereby subsuming the
attribution map into the training computational graph. The resulting model,
class activation latent mapping, or CALM, is trained with the
expectation-maximization algorithm. Our experiments show that CALM identifies
discriminative attributes for image classifiers more accurately than CAM and
other visual attribution baselines. CALM also shows performance improvements
over prior arts on the weakly-supervised object localization benchmarks. Our

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as backbones achieves
great successes in computer vision, this work investigates a simple backbone
network useful for many dense prediction tasks without convolutions. Unlike the
recently-proposed Transformer model (e.g., ViT) that is specially designed for
image classification, we propose Pyramid Vision Transformer~(PVT), which
overcomes the difficulties of porting Transformer to various dense prediction
tasks. PVT has several merits compared to prior arts. (1) Different from ViT
that typically has low-resolution outputs and high computational and memory
cost, PVT can be not only trained on dense partitions of the image to achieve
high output resolution, which is important for dense predictions but also using
a progressive shrinking pyramid to reduce computations of large feature maps.
(2) PVT inherits the advantages from both CNN and Transformer, making it a
unified backbone in various vision tasks without convolutions by simply
replacing CNN backbones. (3) We validate PVT by conducting extensive
experiments, showing that it boosts the performance of many downstream tasks,
e.g., object detection, semantic, and instance segmentation. For example, with
a comparable number of parameters, RetinaNet+PVT achieves 40.4 AP on the COCO
dataset, surpassing RetinNet+ResNet50 (36.3 AP) by 4.1 absolute AP. We hope PVT
could serve as an alternative and useful backbone for pixel-level predictions
and facilitate future researches. Code is available at

applications, including data augmentation, domain adaptation, and model
explanation. Due to the limited memory of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs),
most current 3D GAN models are trained on low-resolution medical images, these
models either cannot scale to high-resolution or are prone to patchy artifacts.
In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end GAN architecture that can generate
high-resolution 3D images. We achieve this goal by separating training and
inference. During training, we adopt a hierarchical structure that
simultaneously generates a low-resolution version of the image and a randomly
selected sub-volume of the high-resolution image. The hierarchical design has
two advantages: First, the memory demand for training on high-resolution images
is amortized among subvolumes. Furthermore, anchoring the high-resolution
subvolumes to a single low-resolution image ensures anatomical consistency
between subvolumes. During inference, our model can directly generate full
high-resolution images. We also incorporate an encoder with a similar
hierarchical structure into the model to extract features from the images.
Experiments on 3D thorax CT and brain MRI demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state of the art in image generation. We also demonstrate clinical
applications of the proposed model in data augmentation, image super-resolution
and clinical-relevant feature extraction.]]></summary>

embed lengthscales in their definition. However, the integrands in these
operators are difficult to define from the data that are typically available
for a given physical system, such as laboratory mechanical property tests. In
contrast, molecular dynamics (MD) does not require these integrands, but it
suffers from computational limitations in the length and time scales it can
address. To combine the strengths of both methods and to obtain a
coarse-grained, homogenized continuum model that efficiently and accurately
captures materials' behavior, we propose a learning framework to extract, from
MD data, an optimal Linear Peridynamic Solid (LPS) model as a surrogate for MD
displacements. To maximize the accuracy of the learnt model we allow the
peridynamic influence function to be partially negative, while preserving the
well-posedness of the resulting model. To achieve this, we provide sufficient
well-posedness conditions for discretized LPS models with sign-changing
influence functions and develop a constrained optimization algorithm that
minimizes the equation residual while enforcing such solvability conditions.
This framework guarantees that the resulting model is mathematically
well-posed, physically consistent, and that it generalizes well to settings
that are different from the ones used during training. We illustrate the
efficacy of the proposed approach with several numerical tests for single layer
graphene. Our two-dimensional tests show the robustness of the proposed
algorithm on validation data sets that include thermal noise, different domain
shapes and external loadings, and discretizations substantially different from
the ones used for training.]]></summary>

serve as biomarkers in various complex human diseases. Since wet-lab
experiments are expensive and time-consuming, computational techniques for
miRNA-disease association prediction have attracted a lot of attention in
recent years. Data scarcity is one of the major challenges in building reliable
machine learning models. Data scarcity combined with the use of pre-calculated
hand-crafted input features has led to problems of overfitting and data
leakage.

We overcome the limitations of existing works by proposing a novel
multi-tasking convolution-based approach, which we refer to as MuCoMiD. MuCoMiD
allows automatic feature extraction while incorporating knowledge from 4
heterogeneous biological information sources (interactions between
miRNA/diseases and protein-coding genes (PCG), miRNA family information, and
disease ontology) in a multi-task setting which is a novel perspective and has
not been studied before. The use of multi-channel convolutions allows us to
extract expressive representations while keeping the model linear and,
therefore, simple. To effectively test the generalization capability of our
model, we construct large-scale experiments on standard benchmark datasets as
well as our proposed larger independent test sets and case studies. MuCoMiD
shows an improvement of at least 5% in 5-fold CV evaluation on HMDDv2.0 and
HMDDv3.0 datasets and at least 49% on larger independent test sets with unseen
miRNA and diseases over state-of-the-art approaches. We share our code for

technological applications. For example, the photoisomerization of azobenzene
allows a drug with an azo scaffold to be activated with light. In principle,
photoswitches with useful reactive properties, such as high isomerization
yields, can be identified through virtual screening with reactive simulations.
In practice these simulations are rarely used for screening, since they require
hundreds of trajectories and expensive quantum chemical methods to account for
non-adiabatic excited state effects. Here we introduce a neural network
potential to accelerate such simulations for azobenzene derivatives. The model,
which is based on diabatic states, is called the \textit{diabatic artificial
neural network} (DANN). The network is six orders of magnitude faster than the
quantum chemistry method used for training. DANN is transferable to molecules
outside the training set, predicting quantum yields for unseen species that are
correlated with experiment. We use the model to virtually screen 3,100
hypothetical molecules, and identify several species with extremely high
quantum yields. Our results pave the way for fast and accurate virtual
screening of photoactive compounds.]]></summary>

detection algorithms arises; the misuse of this formidable A.I. technology
brings serious consequences in the private life of every involved person.
State-of-the-art proliferates with solutions using deep neural networks to
detect a fake multimedia content but unfortunately these algorithms appear to
be neither generalizable nor explainable. However, traces left by Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) engines during the creation of the Deepfakes can be
detected by analyzing ad-hoc frequencies. For this reason, in this paper we
propose a new pipeline able to detect the so-called GAN Specific Frequencies
(GSF) representing a unique fingerprint of the different generative
architectures. By employing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), anomalous
frequencies were detected. The \BETA statistics inferred by the AC coefficients
distribution have been the key to recognize GAN-engine generated data.
Robustness tests were also carried out in order to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the technique using different attacks on images such as JPEG
Compression, mirroring, rotation, scaling, addition of random sized rectangles.
Experiments demonstrated that the method is innovative, exceeds the state of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we propose an attention pyramid method for person
re-identification. Unlike conventional attention-based methods which only learn
a global attention map, our attention pyramid exploits the attention regions in
a multi-scale manner because human attention varies with different scales. Our
attention pyramid imitates the process of human visual perception which tends
to notice the foreground person over the cluttered background, and further
focus on the specific color of the shirt with close observation. Specifically,
we describe our attention pyramid by a "split-attend-merge-stack" principle. We
first split the features into multiple local parts and learn the corresponding
attentions. Then, we merge local attentions and stack these merged attentions
with the residual connection as an attention pyramid. The proposed attention
pyramid is a lightweight plug-and-play module that can be applied to
off-the-shelf models. We implement our attention pyramid method in two
different attention mechanisms including channel-wise attention and spatial
attention. We evaluate our method on four largescale person re-identification
benchmarks including Market-1501, DukeMTMC, CUHK03, and MSMT17. Experimental
results demonstrate the superiority of our method, which outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with limited computational cost.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perceiving obstacles and avoiding collisions is fundamental to the safe
operation of a robot system, particularly when the robot must operate in highly
dynamic human environments. Proximity detection using on-robot sensors can be
used to avoid or mitigate impending collisions. However, existing proximity
sensing methods are orientation and placement dependent, resulting in blind
spots even with large numbers of sensors. In this paper, we introduce the
phenomenon of the Leaky Surface Wave (LSW), a novel sensing modality, and
present AuraSense, a proximity detection system using the LSW. AuraSense is the
first system to realize no-dead-spot proximity sensing for robot arms. It
requires only a single pair of piezoelectric transducers, and can easily be
applied to off-the-shelf robots with minimal modifications. We further
introduce a set of signal processing techniques and a lightweight neural
network to address the unique challenges in using the LSW for proximity
sensing. Finally, we demonstrate a prototype system consisting of a single
piezoelectric element pair on a robot manipulator, which validates our design.
We conducted several micro benchmark experiments and performed more than 2000
on-robot proximity detection trials with various potential robot arm materials,
colliding objects, approach patterns, and robot movement patterns. AuraSense
achieves 100% and 95.3% true positive proximity detection rates when the arm
approaches static and mobile obstacles respectively, with a true negative rate
over 99%, showing the real-world viability of this system.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep networks for Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) have achieved promising
performance recently and it is of great importance to further understand the
interpretability of these networks. Existing methods attempt to provide posthoc
explanations by investigating visual cues, which may not explore the internal
representations learned by deep networks. In this paper, we find that some
hidden units of the network are selective to certain ranges of depth, and thus
such behavior can be served as a way to interpret the internal representations.
Based on our observations, we quantify the interpretability of a deep MDE
network by the depth selectivity of its hidden units. Moreover, we then propose
a method to train interpretable MDE deep networks without changing their
original architectures, by assigning a depth range for each unit to select.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method is able to enhance the
interpretability of deep MDE networks by largely improving the depth
selectivity of their units, while not harming or even improving the depth
estimation accuracy. We further provide a comprehensive analysis to show the
reliability of selective units, the applicability of our method on different
layers, models, and datasets, and a demonstration on analysis of model error.

related objects. When an object is a part of the group, its trajectory depends
on the trajectories of the other group members. Most of the current
state-of-the-art trackers follow the approach of tracking each object
independently, with the mechanism to handle the overlapping trajectories where
necessary. Such an approach does not take inter-object relations into account,
which may cause unreliable tracking for the members of the groups, especially
in crowded scenarios, where individual cues become unreliable due to
occlusions. To overcome these limitations and to extend such trackers to
crowded scenes, we propose a plug-in Relation Encoding Module (REM). REM
encodes relations between tracked objects by running a message passing over a
corresponding spatio-temporal graph, computing relation embeddings for the
tracked objects. Our experiments on MOT17 and MOT20 demonstrate that the
baseline tracker improves its results after a simple extension with REM. The
proposed module allows for tracking severely or even fully occluded objects by

problem in propositional logic. LoGe is composed of three steps: extract
propositional variables from images, reason the answer variables with a logic
layer, and reconstruct the answer image from the variables. We demonstrate that
LoGe outperforms the black box DNN frameworks for generative abstract reasoning

accountability purposes. To this end, interpretability serves to provide these
explanations in terms that are understandable to humans. Central to what is
understandable is how explanations are communicated. Therefore, this survey

focuses on post-hoc methods, which provide explanations after a model is
learned and generally model-agnostic. A common concern for this class of
methods is whether they accurately reflect the model. Hence, how these post-hoc
methods are evaluated is discussed throughout the paper.]]></summary>

different viewpoints. Although ReID is developing at a considerably rapid pace,
there is currently no processing method for the ReID task in multiple
scenarios. However, such processing method is required in real life scenarios,
such as those involving security. In the present study, a new ReID scenario was
explored, which differs in terms of perspective, background, and pose(walking
or cycling). Obviously, ordinary ReID processing methods cannot effectively
handle such a scenario, with the introduction of image datasets being the
optimal solution, in addition to being considerably expensive.

To solve the aforementioned problem, a simple and effective method to
generate images in several new scenarios was proposed, which is names the Copy
and Paste method based on Pose(CPP). The CPP method is based on key point
detection, using copy as paste, to composite a new semantic image dataset in
two different semantic image datasets. As an example, pedestrains and bicycles
can be used to generate several images that show the same person riding on
different bicycles. The CPP method is suitable for ReID tasks in new scenarios
and outperforms the traditional methods when applied to the original datasets
in original ReID tasks. To be specific, the CPP method can also perform better
in terms of generalization for third-party public dataset. The Code and
datasets composited by the CPP method will be available in the future.]]></summary>

foreground-background imbalance, heuristic sampling methods are always
necessary, which either re-sample a subset of all training samples (hard
sampling methods, \eg biased sampling, OHEM), or use all training samples but
re-weight them discriminatively (soft sampling methods, \eg Focal Loss, GHM).
In this paper, we challenge the necessity of such hard/soft sampling methods
for training accurate deep object detectors. While previous studies have shown
that training detectors without heuristic sampling methods would significantly
degrade accuracy, we reveal that this degradation comes from an unreasonable
classification gradient magnitude caused by the imbalance, rather than a lack
of re-sampling/re-weighting. Motivated by our discovery, we propose a simple
yet effective \emph{Sampling-Free} mechanism to achieve a reasonable
classification gradient magnitude by initialization and loss scaling. Unlike
heuristic sampling methods with multiple hyperparameters, our Sampling-Free
mechanism is fully data diagnostic, without laborious hyperparameters
searching. We verify the effectiveness of our method in training anchor-based
and anchor-free object detectors, where our method always achieves higher
detection accuracy than heuristic sampling methods on COCO and PASCAL VOC
datasets. Our Sampling-Free mechanism provides a new perspective to address the
foreground-background imbalance. Our code is released at

an object in the air is more likely to be an airplane than a pig. The rich
notion of context incorporates several aspects including physics rules,
statistical co-occurrences, and relative object sizes, among others. While
previous work has focused on crowd-sourced out-of-context photographs from the
web to study scene context, controlling the nature and extent of contextual
violations has been a daunting task. Here we introduce a diverse, synthetic
Out-of-Context Dataset (OCD) with fine-grained control over scene context. By
leveraging a 3D simulation engine, we systematically control the gravity,
object co-occurrences and relative sizes across 36 object categories in a
virtual household environment. We conducted a series of experiments to gain
insights into the impact of contextual cues on both human and machine vision
using OCD. We conducted psychophysics experiments to establish a human
benchmark for out-of-context recognition, and then compared it with
state-of-the-art computer vision models to quantify the gap between the two. We
propose a context-aware recognition transformer model, fusing object and
contextual information via multi-head attention. Our model captures useful
information for contextual reasoning, enabling human-level performance and
better robustness in out-of-context conditions compared to baseline models

powerful, which enabled technologies such as autonomous driving to evolve with
rapid pace. However, current algorithms mainly share one limitation: They rely
on directly visible objects. This is a major drawback compared to human
behavior, where indirect visual cues caused by the actual object (e.g.,
shadows) are already used intuitively to retrieve information or anticipate
occurring objects. While driving at night, this performance deficit becomes
even more obvious: Humans already process the light artifacts caused by
oncoming vehicles to assume their future appearance, whereas current object
detection systems rely on the oncoming vehicle's direct visibility. Based on
previous work in this subject, we present with this paper a complete system
capable of solving the task to providently detect oncoming vehicles at
nighttime based on their caused light artifacts. For that, we outline the full
algorithm architecture ranging from the detection of light artifacts in the
image space, localizing the objects in the three-dimensional space, and
verifying the objects over time. To demonstrate the applicability, we deploy
the system in a test vehicle and use the information of providently detected
vehicles to control the glare-free high beam system proactively. Using this
experimental setting, we quantify the time benefit that the provident vehicle
detection system provides compared to an in-production computer vision system.
Additionally, the glare-free high beam use case provides a real-time and
real-world visualization interface of the detection results. With this
contribution, we want to put awareness on the unconventional sensing task of
provident object detection and further close the performance gap between human
behavior and computer vision algorithms in order to bring autonomous and
automated driving a step forward.]]></summary>

details by utilizing the reference image but still inevitably generates some

are spatially invariant across the whole image. However, such an assumption is
rarely applicable for real images whose blur kernels are usually spatially
variant due to factors such as object motion and out-of-focus. Hence, existing
blind SR methods would inevitably give rise to poor performance in real
applications. To address this issue, this paper proposes a mutual affine
network (MANet) for spatially variant kernel estimation. Specifically, MANet
has two distinctive features. First, it has a moderate receptive field so as to
keep the locality of degradation. Second, it involves a new mutual affine
convolution (MAConv) layer that enhances feature expressiveness without
increasing receptive field, model size and computation burden. This is made
possible through exploiting channel interdependence, which applies each channel
split with an affine transformation module whose input are the rest channel
splits. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real images show that the
proposed MANet not only performs favorably for both spatially variant and
invariant kernel estimation, but also leads to state-of-the-art blind SR
performance when combined with non-blind SR methods.]]></summary>

researchers as they are not restricted to the spatial inductive bias of
ConvNets. However, although Transformer-based backbones have achieved much
progress on ImageNet classification, it is still unclear whether the learned
representations are as transferable as or even more transferable than ConvNets'
features. To address this point, we systematically investigate the transfer
learning ability of ConvNets and vision transformers in 15 single-task and
multi-task performance evaluations. Given the strong correlation between the
performance of pre-trained models and transfer learning, we include 2 residual
ConvNets (i.e., R-101x3 and R-152x4) and 3 Transformer-based visual backbones
(i.e., ViT-B, ViT-L and Swin-B), which have close error rates on ImageNet, that
indicate similar transfer learning performance on downstream datasets.

We observe consistent advantages of Transformer-based backbones on 13
downstream tasks (out of 15), including but not limited to fine-grained
classification, scene recognition (classification, segmentation and depth
estimation), open-domain classification, face recognition, etc. More
specifically, we find that two ViT models heavily rely on whole network
fine-tuning to achieve performance gains while Swin Transformer does not have
such a requirement. Moreover, vision transformers behave more robustly in
multi-task learning, i.e., bringing more improvements when managing mutually
beneficial tasks and reducing performance losses when tackling irrelevant
tasks. We hope our discoveries can facilitate the exploration and exploitation
of vision transformers in the future.]]></summary>

not easy, and the current models are not necessarily optimal with respect to

vision tasks. For image super-resolution (SR), it learns to predict diverse
photo-realistic high-resolution (HR) images from the low-resolution (LR) image
rather than learning a deterministic mapping. For image rescaling, it achieves
high accuracy by jointly modelling the downscaling and upscaling processes.
While existing approaches employ specialized techniques for these two tasks, we
set out to unify them in a single formulation. In this paper, we propose the
hierarchical conditional flow (HCFlow) as a unified framework for image SR and
image rescaling. More specifically, HCFlow learns a bijective mapping between
HR and LR image pairs by modelling the distribution of the LR image and the
rest high-frequency component simultaneously. In particular, the high-frequency
component is conditional on the LR image in a hierarchical manner. To further
enhance the performance, other losses such as perceptual loss and GAN loss are
combined with the commonly used negative log-likelihood loss in training.
Extensive experiments on general image SR, face image SR and image rescaling
have demonstrated that the proposed HCFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality.]]></summary>

often exceed the capacity of standard desktop GPUs. As a result, most deep
learning-based medical image analysis tasks require the input images to be
downsampled, often substantially, before these can be fed to a neural network.
However, downsampling can lead to a loss of image quality, which is undesirable
especially in reconstruction tasks, where the fine geometric details need to be
preserved. In this paper, we propose that high-resolution images can be
reconstructed in a coarse-to-fine fashion, where a deep learning algorithm is
only responsible for generating a coarse representation of the image, which
consumes moderate GPU memory. For producing the high-resolution outcome, we
propose two novel methods: learned voxel rearrangement of the coarse output and
hierarchical image synthesis. Compared to the coarse output, the
high-resolution counterpart allows for smooth surface triangulation, which can
be 3D-printed in the highest possible quality. Experiments of this paper are
carried out on the dataset of AutoImplant 2021
(https://autoimplant2021.grand-challenge.org/), a MICCAI challenge on cranial
implant design. The dataset contains high-resolution skulls that can be viewed
as 2D manifolds embedded in a 3D space. Codes associated with this study can be

in foggy weather. Collecting and annotating data in such a scenario is very
time, labor and cost intensive. In this paper, we tackle this problem by
simulating physically accurate fog into clear-weather scenes, so that the
abundant existing real datasets captured in clear weather can be repurposed for
our task. Our contributions are twofold: 1) We develop a physically valid fog
simulation method that is applicable to any LiDAR dataset. This unleashes the
acquisition of large-scale foggy training data at no extra cost. These
partially synthetic data can be used to improve the robustness of several
perception methods, such as 3D object detection and tracking or simultaneous
localization and mapping, on real foggy data. 2) Through extensive experiments
with several state-of-the-art detection approaches, we show that our fog
simulation can be leveraged to significantly improve the performance for 3D
object detection in the presence of fog. Thus, we are the first to provide
strong 3D object detection baselines on the Seeing Through Fog dataset. Our

Previous few-shot segmentation methods mainly employ the information of support
images as guidance for query image segmentation. Although some works propose to
build cross-reference between support and query images, their extraction of
query information still depends on the support images. We here propose to
extract the information from the query itself independently to benefit the
few-shot segmentation task. To this end, we first propose a prior extractor to
learn the query information from the unlabeled images with our proposed
global-local contrastive learning. Then, we extract a set of predetermined
priors via this prior extractor. With the obtained priors, we generate the
prior region maps for query images, which locate the objects, as guidance to
perform cross interaction with support features. In such a way, the extraction
of query information is detached from the support branch, overcoming the
limitation by support, and could obtain more informative query clues to achieve
better interaction. Without bells and whistles, the proposed approach achieves
new state-of-the-art performance for the few-shot segmentation task on
PASCAL-5$^{i}$ and COCO datasets.]]></summary>

indoor scene's 3D structure and semantic label. Given noisy depth maps, a
camera trajectory, and 2D semantic labels at train time, the proposed neural
network learns to fuse the depth over frames with suitable semantic labels in
the scene space. Our approach exploits the joint volumetric representation of
the depth and semantics in the scene feature space to solve this task. For a
compelling online fusion of the semantic labels and geometry in real-time, we
introduce an efficient vortex pooling block while dropping the routing network
in online depth fusion to preserve high-frequency surface details. We show that
the context information provided by the semantics of the scene helps the depth
fusion network learn noise-resistant features. Not only that, it helps overcome
the shortcomings of the current online depth fusion method in dealing with thin
object structures, thickening artifacts, and false surfaces. Experimental
evaluation on the Replica dataset shows that our approach can perform depth
fusion at 37, 10 frames per second with an average reconstruction F-score of
88%, and 91%, respectively, depending on the depth map resolution. Moreover,
our model shows an average IoU score of 0.515 on the ScanNet 3D semantic

of power intensive multitask DNN architecture called Multitask-CenterNet with
respect to performance measures such as, FPS and power efficiency. As an
automotive supercomputer, ProAI delivers an excellent combination of
performance and efficiency, managing nearly twice the number of FPS per watt

quantity of measurements required for a fusion based dense 3D mapping system to
converge to an accurate, de-noised surface reconstruction. This is achieved
through the use of a Normalised Information Distance metric, that computes the
novelty of the information contained in each incoming frame with respect to the
reconstruction, and avoids fusing those frames that exceed a redundancy
threshold. This provides a principled approach for opitmising the trade-off
between surface reconstruction accuracy and the computational cost of
processing frames. The technique builds upon the ElasticFusion (EF) algorithm
where we report results of the technique's scalability and the accuracy of the
resultant maps by applying it to both the ICL-NUIM and TUM RGB-D datasets.
These results demonstrate the capabilities of the approach in performing
accurate surface reconstructions whilst utilising a fraction of the frames when

shopping and has a huge potential commercial value. However, existing 3D
virtual try-on methods mainly rely on annotated 3D human shapes and garment
templates, which hinders their applications in practical scenarios. 2D virtual
try-on approaches provide a faster alternative to manipulate clothed humans,
but lack the rich and realistic 3D representation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Monocular-to-3D Virtual Try-On Network (M3D-VTON) that builds on the
merits of both 2D and 3D approaches. By integrating 2D information efficiently
and learning a mapping that lifts the 2D representation to 3D, we make the
first attempt to reconstruct a 3D try-on mesh only taking the target clothing
and a person image as inputs. The proposed M3D-VTON includes three modules: 1)
The Monocular Prediction Module (MPM) that estimates an initial full-body depth
map and accomplishes 2D clothes-person alignment through a novel two-stage
warping procedure; 2) The Depth Refinement Module (DRM) that refines the
initial body depth to produce more detailed pleat and face characteristics; 3)
The Texture Fusion Module (TFM) that fuses the warped clothing with the
non-target body part to refine the results. We also construct a high-quality
synthesized Monocular-to-3D virtual try-on dataset, in which each person image
is associated with a front and a back depth map. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed M3D-VTON can manipulate and reconstruct the 3D
human body wearing the given clothing with compelling details and is more
efficient than other 3D approaches.]]></summary>

X-Ray (CXR), are largely employed to facilitate the diagnosis of the COVID-19.
Since manual report writing is usually too time-consuming, a more intelligent
auxiliary medical system that could generate medical reports automatically and
immediately is urgently needed. In this article, we propose to use the medical
visual language BERT (Medical-VLBERT) model to identify the abnormality on the
COVID-19 scans and generate the medical report automatically based on the
detected lesion regions. To produce more accurate medical reports and minimize
the visual-and-linguistic differences, this model adopts an alternate learning
strategy with two procedures that are knowledge pretraining and transferring.
To be more precise, the knowledge pretraining procedure is to memorize the
knowledge from medical texts, while the transferring procedure is to utilize
the acquired knowledge for professional medical sentences generations through
observations of medical images. In practice, for automatic medical report
generation on the COVID-19 cases, we constructed a dataset of 368 medical
findings in Chinese and 1104 chest CT scans from The First Affiliated Hospital
of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China, and The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun
Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, China. Besides, to alleviate the insufficiency of
the COVID-19 training samples, our model was first trained on the large-scale
Chinese CX-CHR dataset and then transferred to the COVID-19 CT dataset for
further fine-tuning. The experimental results showed that Medical-VLBERT
achieved state-of-the-art performances on terminology prediction and report
generation with the Chinese COVID-19 CT dataset and the CX-CHR dataset. The

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: Cervical cancer seriously affects the health of the female
reproductive system. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) emerges as a
non-invasive, high-resolution imaging technology for cervical disease
detection. However, OCT image annotation is knowledge-intensive and
time-consuming, which impedes the training process of deep-learning-based
classification models. Objective: This study aims to develop a computer-aided
diagnosis (CADx) approach to classifying in-vivo cervical OCT images based on
self-supervised learning. Methods: Besides high-level semantic features
extracted by a convolutional neural network (CNN), the proposed CADx approach
leverages unlabeled cervical OCT images' texture features learned by
contrastive texture learning. We conducted ten-fold cross-validation on the OCT
image dataset from a multi-center clinical study on 733 patients from China.
Results: In a binary classification task for detecting high-risk diseases,
including high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and cervical
cancer, our method achieved an area-under-the-curve (AUC) value of 0.9798 Plus
or Minus 0.0157 with a sensitivity of 91.17 Plus or Minus 4.99% and a
specificity of 93.96 Plus or Minus 4.72% for OCT image patches; also, it
outperformed two out of four medical experts on the test set. Furthermore, our
method achieved a 91.53% sensitivity and 97.37% specificity on an external
validation dataset containing 287 3D OCT volumes from 118 Chinese patients in a
new hospital using a cross-shaped threshold voting strategy. Conclusion: The
proposed contrastive-learning-based CADx method outperformed the end-to-end CNN
models and provided better interpretability based on texture features, which
holds great potential to be used in the clinical protocol of "see-and-treat."]]></summary>

rudimentary light field providing two sub-aperture views of a scene in a single
capture. The DP sensor was developed to improve how cameras perform autofocus.
Since the DP sensor's introduction, researchers have found additional uses for
the DP data, such as depth estimation, reflection removal, and defocus
deblurring. We are interested in the latter task of defocus deblurring. In
particular, we propose a single-image deblurring network that incorporates the
two sub-aperture views into a multi-task framework. Specifically, we show that
jointly learning to predict the two DP views from a single blurry input image
improves the network's ability to learn to deblur the image. Our experiments
show this multi-task strategy achieves +1dB PSNR improvement over
state-of-the-art defocus deblurring methods. In addition, our multi-task
framework allows accurate DP-view synthesis (e.g., ~ 39dB PSNR) from the single
input image. These high-quality DP views can be used for other DP-based
applications, such as reflection removal. As part of this effort, we have
captured a new dataset of 7,059 high-quality images to support our training for
the DP-view synthesis task. Our dataset, code, and trained models will be made

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep hashing has been widely applied to large-scale image retrieval by
encoding high-dimensional data points into binary codes for efficient
retrieval. Compared with pairwise/triplet similarity based hash learning,
central similarity based hashing can more efficiently capture the global data
distribution. For multi-label image retrieval, however, previous methods only
use multiple hash centers with equal weights to generate one centroid as the
learning target, which ignores the relationship between the weights of hash
centers and the proportion of instance regions in the image. To address the
above issue, we propose a two-step alternative optimization approach,
Instance-weighted Central Similarity (ICS), to automatically learn the center
weight corresponding to a hash code. Firstly, we apply the maximum entropy
regularizer to prevent one hash center from dominating the loss function, and
compute the center weights via projection gradient descent. Secondly, we update
neural network parameters by standard back-propagation with fixed center
weights. More importantly, the learned center weights can well reflect the
proportion of foreground instances in the image. Our method achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on the image retrieval benchmarks, and especially
improves the mAP by 1.6%-6.4% on the MS COCO dataset.]]></summary>

polyps. In clinical practice, precise polyp segmentation provides important
information in the early detection of colorectal cancer. Therefore, automatic
polyp segmentation techniques are of great importance for both patients and
doctors. Most existing methods are based on U-shape structure and use
element-wise addition or concatenation to fuse different level features
progressively in decoder. However, both the two operations easily generate
plenty of redundant information, which will weaken the complementarity between
different level features, resulting in inaccurate localization and blurred
edges of polyps. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-scale
subtraction network (MSNet) to segment polyp from colonoscopy image.
Specifically, we first design a subtraction unit (SU) to produce the difference
features between adjacent levels in encoder. Then, we pyramidally equip the SUs
at different levels with varying receptive fields, thereby obtaining rich
multi-scale difference information. In addition, we build a training-free
network "LossNet" to comprehensively supervise the polyp-aware features from
bottom layer to top layer, which drives the MSNet to capture the detailed and
structural cues simultaneously. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our MSNet performs favorably against most
state-of-the-art methods under different evaluation metrics. Furthermore, MSNet
runs at a real-time speed of $\sim$70fps when processing a $352 \times 352$
image. The source code will be publicly available at

audio, commonly known as deepfakes, using deep learning technologies, the
problem of its misuse is a well-known issue now. Recently, a new problem of
generating cloned or synthesized human voice of a person is emerging. AI-based
deep learning models can synthesize any person's voice requiring just a few
seconds of audio. With the emerging threat of impersonation attacks using
deepfake videos and audios, new deepfake detectors are need that focuses on
both, video and audio. Detecting deepfakes is a challenging task and
researchers have made numerous attempts and proposed several deepfake detection
methods. To develop a good deepfake detector, a handsome amount of good quality
dataset is needed that captures the real world scenarios. Many researchers have
contributed in this cause and provided several deepfake dataset, self generated
and in-the-wild. However, almost all of these datasets either contains deepfake
videos or audio. Moreover, the recent deepfake datasets proposed by researchers
have racial bias issues. Hence, there is a crucial need of a good deepfake
video and audio deepfake dataset. To fill this gap, we propose a novel
Audio-Video Deepfake dataset (FakeAVCeleb) that not only contains deepfake
videos but respective synthesized cloned audios as well. We generated our
dataset using recent most popular deepfake generation methods and the videos
and audios are perfectly lip-synced with each other. To generate a more
realistic dataset, we selected real YouTube videos of celebrities having four
racial backgrounds (Caucasian, Black, East Asian and South Asian) to counter
the racial bias issue. Lastly, we propose a novel multimodal detection method
that detects deepfake videos and audios based on our multimodal Audio-Video

train multiple objectives with a shared architecture. It has been shown that by
training multiple tasks together inference time and compute resources can be
saved, while the objectives performance remains on a similar or even higher
level. However, in perception related multitask networks only closely related
tasks can be found, such as object detection, instance and semantic
segmentation or depth estimation. Multitask networks with diverse tasks and
their effects with respect to efficiency on one another are not well studied.
In this paper we augment the CenterNet anchor-free approach for training
multiple diverse perception related tasks together, including the task of
object detection and semantic segmentation as well as human pose estimation. We
refer to this DNN as Multitask-CenterNet (MCN). Additionally, we study
different MCN settings for efficiency. The MCN can perform several tasks at
once while maintaining, and in some cases even exceeding, the performance
values of its corresponding single task networks. More importantly, the MCN
architecture decreases inference time and reduces network size when compared to

design of single image deblurring networks. Conventional methods typically
stack sub-networks with multi-scale input images and gradually improve

yielding inevitably high computational costs. Toward a fast and accurate
deblurring network design, we revisit the coarse-to-fine strategy and present a
multi-input multi-output U-net (MIMO-UNet). The MIMO-UNet has three distinct
features. First, the single encoder of the MIMO-UNet takes multi-scale input
images to ease the difficulty of training. Second, the single decoder of the
MIMO-UNet outputs multiple deblurred images with different scales to mimic
multi-cascaded U-nets using a single U-shaped network. Last, asymmetric feature
fusion is introduced to merge multi-scale features in an efficient manner.
Extensive experiments on the GoPro and RealBlur datasets demonstrate that the

dedicate to modeling the visibility masking effects of different factors in
spatial and frequency domains, and then fusing them into an overall JND
estimate. However, the overall visibility masking effect can be related with
more contributing factors beyond those have been considered in the literature
and it is also insufficiently accurate to formulate the masking effect even for
an individual factor. Moreover, the potential interactions among different
masking effects are also difficult to be characterized with a simple fusion
model. In this work, we turn to a dramatically different way to address these
problems with a top-down design philosophy. Instead of formulating and fusing
multiple masking effects in a bottom-up way, the proposed JND estimation model
directly generates a critical perceptual lossless (CPL) image from a top-down
perspective and calculates the difference map between the original image and
the CPL image as the final JND map. Given an input image, an adaptively
critical point (perceptual lossless threshold), defined as the minimum number
of spectral components in Karhunen-Lo\'{e}ve Transform (KLT) used for
perceptual lossless image reconstruction, is derived by exploiting the
convergence characteristics of KLT coefficient energy. Then, the CPL image can
be reconstructed via inverse KLT according to the derived critical point.
Finally, the difference map between the original image and the CPL image is
calculated as the JND map. The performance of the proposed JND model is

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few-shot learning aims to recognize novel classes with few examples.
Pre-training based methods effectively tackle the problem by pre-training a
feature extractor and then fine-tuning it through the nearest centroid based
meta-learning. However, results show that the fine-tuning step makes marginal
improvements. In this paper, 1) we figure out the reason, i.e., in the
pre-trained feature space, the base classes already form compact clusters while
novel classes spread as groups with large variances, which implies that
fine-tuning feature extractor is less meaningful; 2) instead of fine-tuning
feature extractor, we focus on estimating more representative prototypes.
Consequently, we propose a novel prototype completion based meta-learning
framework. This framework first introduces primitive knowledge (i.e.,
class-level part or attribute annotations) and extracts representative features
for seen attributes as priors. Second, a part/attribute transfer network is
designed to learn to infer the representative features for unseen attributes as
supplementary priors. Finally, a prototype completion network is devised to
learn to complete prototypes with these priors. Moreover, to avoid the
prototype completion error, we further develop a Gaussian based prototype
fusion strategy that fuses the mean-based and completed prototypes by
exploiting the unlabeled samples. Extensive experiments show that our method:
(i) obtains more accurate prototypes; (ii) achieves superior performance on
both inductive and transductive FSL settings.]]></summary>

a new unseen scenario despite the success in cross-camera person matching.
Recent efforts have been substantially devoted to domain adaptive person re-id
where extensive unlabeled data in the new scenario are utilized in a
transductive learning manner. However, for each scenario, it is required to
first collect enough data and then train such a domain adaptive re-id model,
thus restricting their practical application. Instead, we aim to explore
multiple labeled datasets to learn generalized domain-invariant representations
for person re-id, which is expected universally effective for each new-coming
re-id scenario. To pursue practicability in real-world systems, we collect all
the person re-id datasets (20 datasets) in this field and select the three most
frequently used datasets (i.e., Market1501, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17) as unseen
target domains. In addition, we develop DataHunter that collects over 300K+
weak annotated images named YouTube-Human from YouTube street-view videos,
which joins 17 remaining full labeled datasets to form multiple source domains.
On such a large and challenging benchmark called FastHuman (~440K+ labeled
images), we further propose a simple yet effective Semi-Supervised Knowledge
Distillation (SSKD) framework. SSKD effectively exploits the weakly annotated
data by assigning soft pseudo labels to YouTube-Human to improve models'
generalization ability. Experiments on several protocols verify the
effectiveness of the proposed SSKD framework on domain generalizable person
re-id, which is even comparable to supervised learning on the target domains.
Lastly, but most importantly, we hope the proposed benchmark FastHuman could
bring the next development of domain generalizable person re-id algorithms.]]></summary>

semantic knowledge reasoning of class structure for solving the problem of
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) from the big data with non-shared and
imbalanced classes to specified small and imbalanced applications (NI-UDA),
where non-shared classes mean the label space out of the target domain. Our
goal is to leverage priori hierarchy knowledge to enhance domain adversarial
aligned feature representation with graph reasoning. In this paper, to address
two challenges in NI-UDA, we equip adversarial domain adaptation with Hierarchy
Graph Reasoning (HGR) layer and the Source Classifier Filter (SCF). For sparse
classes transfer challenge, our HGR layer can aggregate local feature to
hierarchy graph nodes by node prediction and enhance domain adversarial aligned
feature with hierarchy graph reasoning for sparse classes. Our HGR contributes
to learn direct semantic patterns for sparse classes by hierarchy attention in
self-attention, non-linear mapping and graph normalization. our SCF is proposed
for the challenge of knowledge sharing from non-shared data without negative
transfer effect by filtering low-confidence non-shared data in HGR layer.
Experiments on two benchmark datasets show our GADA methods consistently
improve the state-of-the-art adversarial UDA algorithms, e.g. GADA(HGR) can
greatly improve f1 of the MDD by \textbf{7.19\%} and GVB-GD by \textbf{7.89\%}

stronger discrimination and generalization abilities in the target domain. We
also take advantage of NSAE structure and propose a two-step fine-tuning

the biologically inspired event camera produces a stream of asynchronous and
sparse events with much lower latency. In practice, the visible cameras can
better perceive texture details and slow motion, while event cameras can be
free from motion blurs and have a larger dynamic range which enables them to
work well under fast motion and low illumination. Therefore, the two sensors
can cooperate with each other to achieve more reliable object tracking. In this
work, we propose a large-scale Visible-Event benchmark (termed VisEvent) due to
the lack of a realistic and scaled dataset for this task. Our dataset consists
of 820 video pairs captured under low illumination, high speed, and background
clutter scenarios, and it is divided into a training and a testing subset, each
of which contains 500 and 320 videos, respectively. Based on VisEvent, we
transform the event flows into event images and construct more than 30 baseline
methods by extending current single-modality trackers into dual-modality
versions. More importantly, we further build a simple but effective tracking
algorithm by proposing a cross-modality transformer, to achieve more effective
feature fusion between visible and event data. Extensive experiments on the
proposed VisEvent dataset, and two simulated datasets (i.e., OTB-DVS and
VOT-DVS), validated the effectiveness of our model. The dataset and source code

tasks using only a small single perturbation called a universal adversarial
perturbation (UAP), is a realistic security threat to the practical application
of a DNN. In particular, such attacks cause serious problems in medical
imaging. Given that computer-based systems are generally operated under a
black-box condition in which only queries on inputs are allowed and outputs are
accessible, the impact of UAPs seems to be limited because well-used algorithms
for generating UAPs are limited to a white-box condition in which adversaries
can access the model weights and loss gradients. Nevertheless, we demonstrate
that UAPs are easily generatable using a relatively small dataset under
black-box conditions. In particular, we propose a method for generating UAPs
using a simple hill-climbing search based only on DNN outputs and demonstrate
the validity of the proposed method using representative DNN-based medical
image classifications. Black-box UAPs can be used to conduct both non-targeted
and targeted attacks. Overall, the black-box UAPs showed high attack success
rates (40% to 90%), although some of them had relatively low success rates
because the method only utilizes limited information to generate UAPs. The
vulnerability of black-box UAPs was observed in several model architectures.
The results indicate that adversaries can also generate UAPs through a simple
procedure under the black-box condition to foil or control DNN-based medical
image diagnoses, and that UAPs are a more realistic security threat.]]></summary>

introduce two novel losses that contrast action instances with background ones

results demonstrate that our completeness guidance indeed helps the model to
locate complete action instances, leading to large performance gains especially
under high IoU thresholds. Moreover, we demonstrate the superiority of our

fusion schemes. Firstly, unlike existing multimodal methods that necessitate

modality-specific batch normalization layers in the encoder, which also enables
implicit fusion via joint feature representation learning. Secondly, we propose
a bidirectional multi-layer fusion scheme, where multimodal features can be
exploited progressively. To take advantage of such scheme, we introduce two
asymmetric fusion operations including channel shuffle and pixel shift, which
learn different fused features with respect to different fusion directions.
These two operations are parameter-free and strengthen the multimodal feature
interactions across channels as well as enhance the spatial feature
discrimination within channels. We conduct extensive experiments on semantic
segmentation and image translation tasks, based on three publicly available

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tactile sensing plays an important role in robotic perception and
manipulation tasks. To overcome the real-world limitations of data collection,
simulating tactile response in a virtual environment comes as a desirable
direction of robotic research. In this paper, we propose Elastic Interaction of
Particles (EIP) for tactile simulation. Most existing works model the tactile
sensor as a rigid multi-body, which is incapable of reflecting the elastic
property of the tactile sensor as well as characterizing the fine-grained
physical interaction between the two objects. By contrast, EIP models the
tactile sensor as a group of coordinated particles, and the elastic property is
applied to regulate the deformation of particles during contact. With the
tactile simulation by EIP, we further propose a tactile-visual perception
network that enables information fusion between tactile data and visual images.
The perception network is based on a global-to-local fusion mechanism where
multi-scale tactile features are aggregated to the corresponding local region
of the visual modality with the guidance of tactile positions and directions.
The fusion method exhibits superiority regarding the 3D geometric
reconstruction task.]]></summary>

interpretations, even for humans sometimes. Several math symbols are very
similar in the writing style, such as dot and comma or 0, O, and o, which is a
challenge for HME recognition systems to handle without using contextual
information. To address this problem, this paper presents a Transformer-based
Math Language Model (TMLM). Based on the self-attention mechanism, the
high-level representation of an input token in a sequence of tokens is computed
by how it is related to the previous tokens. Thus, TMLM can capture long
dependencies and correlations among symbols and relations in a mathematical
expression (ME). We trained the proposed language model using a corpus of
approximately 70,000 LaTeX sequences provided in CROHME 2016. TMLM achieved the
perplexity of 4.42, which outperformed the previous math language models, i.e.,
the N-gram and recurrent neural network-based language models. In addition, we
combine TMLM into a stochastic context-free grammar-based HME recognition
system using a weighting parameter to re-rank the top-10 best candidates. The
expression rates on the testing sets of CROHME 2016 and CROHME 2019 were
improved by 2.97 and 0.83 percentage points, respectively.]]></summary>

advancement of deep convolutional neural networks. However, demographic bias
among different racial cohorts still challenges the practical face recognition
system. The race factor has been proven to be a dilemma for fair FR (FFR) as
the subject-related specific attributes induce the classification bias whilst
carrying some useful cues for FR. To mitigate racial bias and meantime preserve
robust FR, we abstract face identity-related representation as a signal
denoising problem and propose a progressive cross transformer (PCT) method for
fair face recognition. Originating from the signal decomposition theory, we
attempt to decouple face representation into i) identity-related components and
ii) noisy/identity-unrelated components induced by race. As an extension of
signal subspace decomposition, we formulate face decoupling as a generalized
functional expression model to cross-predict face identity and race
information. The face expression model is further concretized by designing dual
cross-transformers to distill identity-related components and suppress racial
noises. In order to refine face representation, we take a progressive face
decoupling way to learn identity/race-specific transformations, so that
identity-unrelated components induced by race could be better disentangled. We
evaluate the proposed PCT on the public fair face recognition benchmarks (BFW,
RFW) and verify that PCT is capable of mitigating bias in face recognition
while achieving state-of-the-art FR performance. Besides, visualization results
also show that the attention maps in PCT can well reveal the
race-related/biased facial regions.]]></summary>

estimation? In general, there are two main approaches to use SSL: 1. Using
pre-trained weights which can be done via weights pre-training on ImageNet or
via SSL tasks. 2. Leveraging SSL as an auxiliary co-training task besides of
Supervised Learning (SL) tasks at the same time. In this study, modified
versions of jigsaw puzzling and rotation as SSL pre-text tasks are used and the
best architecture for our proposed Hybrid Multi-Task Learning (HMTL) is found.
Finally, the HopeNet method as a baseline is selected and the impact of SSL
pre-training and ImageNet pre-training on both HMTL and SL are compared. The
error rate reduced by the HTML method up to 11% compare to the SL. Moreover,
HMTL method showed that it was good with all kinds of initial weights: random,
ImageNet and SSL pre-training weights. Also, it was observed, when puzzled
images are used for SL alone, the average error rate placed between SL and HMTL
which showed the importance of local spatial features compare to global spatial

operation of a robot system, particularly when the robot must operate in highly
dynamic human environments. Proximity detection using on-robot sensors can be
used to avoid or mitigate impending collisions. However, existing proximity
sensing methods are orientation and placement dependent, resulting in blind
spots even with large numbers of sensors. In this paper, we introduce the
phenomenon of the Leaky Surface Wave (LSW), a novel sensing modality, and
present AuraSense, a proximity detection system using the LSW. AuraSense is the
first system to realize no-dead-spot proximity sensing for robot arms. It
requires only a single pair of piezoelectric transducers, and can easily be
applied to off-the-shelf robots with minimal modifications. We further
introduce a set of signal processing techniques and a lightweight neural
network to address the unique challenges in using the LSW for proximity
sensing. Finally, we demonstrate a prototype system consisting of a single
piezoelectric element pair on a robot manipulator, which validates our design.
We conducted several micro benchmark experiments and performed more than 2000
on-robot proximity detection trials with various potential robot arm materials,
colliding objects, approach patterns, and robot movement patterns. AuraSense
achieves 100% and 95.3% true positive proximity detection rates when the arm
approaches static and mobile obstacles respectively, with a true negative rate
over 99%, showing the real-world viability of this system.]]></summary>

and enhances the immersive experience if coupled with AR/VR. But the problem
with binaural audio recording is that it requires a specialized setup which is
not possible to fabricate within handheld devices as compared to traditional
mono audio that can be recorded with a single microphone. In order to overcome
this drawback, prior works have tried to uplift the mono recorded audio to
binaural audio as a post processing step conditioning on the visual input. But
all the prior approaches missed other most important information required for
the task, i.e. distance of different sound producing objects from the recording
setup. In this work, we argue that the depth map of the scene can act as a
proxy for encoding distance information of objects in the scene and show that
adding depth features along with image features improves the performance both
qualitatively and quantitatively. We propose a novel encoder-decoder
architecture, where we use a hierarchical attention mechanism to encode the

synthesis. Recent advances in volumetric neural rendering, such as neural
radiance fields (NeRF), has enabled the photorealistic novel view synthesis of
static scenes with impressive results. However, modeling dynamic and
controllable objects as part of a scene with such scene representations is
still challenging. In this work, we design a system that enables both novel
view synthesis for portrait video, including the human subject and the scene
background, and explicit control of the facial expressions through a
low-dimensional expression representation. We leverage the expression space of
a 3D morphable face model (3DMM) to represent the distribution of human facial
expressions, and use it to condition the NeRF volumetric function. Furthermore,
we impose a spatial prior brought by 3DMM fitting to guide the network to learn
disentangled control for scene appearance and facial actions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method on free view synthesis of portrait videos with
expression controls. To train a scene, our method only requires a short video
of a subject captured by a mobile device.]]></summary>

convolutional networks. However, studies have shown the potential of pruning as
a form of regularization, which reduces overfitting and improves
generalization. We demonstrate that this family of strategies provides
additional benefits beyond computational performance and generalization. Our
analyses reveal that pruning structures (filters and/or layers) from
convolutional networks increase not only generalization but also robustness to
adversarial images (natural images with content modified). Such achievements
are possible since pruning reduces network capacity and provides
regularization, which have been proven effective tools against adversarial
images. In contrast to promising defense mechanisms that require training with
adversarial images and careful regularization, we show that pruning obtains
competitive results considering only natural images (e.g., the standard and
low-cost training). We confirm these findings on several adversarial attacks
and architectures; thus suggesting the potential of pruning as a novel defense
mechanism against adversarial images.]]></summary>

systems are often dependent on a substantial increase in the number of model
parameters. This has led to various attempts of compressing such models, but
existing methods have not considered the differences in the predictive power of
various model components or in the generalizability of the compressed models.
To understand the connection between model compression and out-of-distribution
generalization, we define the task of compressing language representation
models such that they perform best in a domain adaptation setting. We choose to
address this problem from a causal perspective, attempting to estimate the
average treatment effect (ATE) of a model component, such as a single layer, on
the model's predictions. Our proposed ATE-guided Model Compression scheme
(AMoC), generates many model candidates, differing by the model components that
were removed. Then, we select the best candidate through a stepwise regression
model that utilizes the ATE to predict the expected performance on the target
domain. AMoC outperforms strong baselines on dozens of domain pairs across
three text classification and sequence tagging tasks.]]></summary>

features via k-nearest neighbor algorithm. Then graph convolutional network
(GCN) encoders extract features from two graphs respectively. Self-supervised
loss is designed to maximize the agreement of the embeddings of the same node
in the topology graph and the feature graph. Extensive experiments on real

achieved great success and become a milestone in the field of artificial
intelligence (AI). Owing to sophisticated pre-training objectives and huge
model parameters, large-scale PTMs can effectively capture knowledge from
massive labeled and unlabeled data. By storing knowledge into huge parameters
and fine-tuning on specific tasks, the rich knowledge implicitly encoded in
huge parameters can benefit a variety of downstream tasks, which has been
extensively demonstrated via experimental verification and empirical analysis.
It is now the consensus of the AI community to adopt PTMs as backbone for
downstream tasks rather than learning models from scratch. In this paper, we
take a deep look into the history of pre-training, especially its special
relation with transfer learning and self-supervised learning, to reveal the
crucial position of PTMs in the AI development spectrum. Further, we
comprehensively review the latest breakthroughs of PTMs. These breakthroughs
are driven by the surge of computational power and the increasing availability
of data, towards four important directions: designing effective architectures,
utilizing rich contexts, improving computational efficiency, and conducting
interpretation and theoretical analysis. Finally, we discuss a series of open
problems and research directions of PTMs, and hope our view can inspire and

X-Ray (CXR), are largely employed to facilitate the diagnosis of the COVID-19.
Since manual report writing is usually too time-consuming, a more intelligent
auxiliary medical system that could generate medical reports automatically and
immediately is urgently needed. In this article, we propose to use the medical
visual language BERT (Medical-VLBERT) model to identify the abnormality on the
COVID-19 scans and generate the medical report automatically based on the
detected lesion regions. To produce more accurate medical reports and minimize
the visual-and-linguistic differences, this model adopts an alternate learning
strategy with two procedures that are knowledge pretraining and transferring.
To be more precise, the knowledge pretraining procedure is to memorize the
knowledge from medical texts, while the transferring procedure is to utilize
the acquired knowledge for professional medical sentences generations through
observations of medical images. In practice, for automatic medical report
generation on the COVID-19 cases, we constructed a dataset of 368 medical
findings in Chinese and 1104 chest CT scans from The First Affiliated Hospital
of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China, and The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun
Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, China. Besides, to alleviate the insufficiency of
the COVID-19 training samples, our model was first trained on the large-scale
Chinese CX-CHR dataset and then transferred to the COVID-19 CT dataset for
further fine-tuning. The experimental results showed that Medical-VLBERT
achieved state-of-the-art performances on terminology prediction and report
generation with the Chinese COVID-19 CT dataset and the CX-CHR dataset. The
Chinese COVID-19 CT dataset is available at https://covid19ct.github.io/.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDoH) have important roles in
shaping people's health. In clinical research studies, especially comparative
effectiveness studies, failure to adjust for SBDoH factors will potentially
cause confounding issues and misclassification errors in either statistical
analyses and machine learning-based models. However, there are limited studies
to examine SBDoH factors in clinical outcomes due to the lack of structured
SBDoH information in current electronic health record (EHR) systems, while much
of the SBDoH information is documented in clinical narratives. Natural language
processing (NLP) is thus the key technology to extract such information from
unstructured clinical text. However, there is not a mature clinical NLP system
focusing on SBDoH. In this study, we examined two state-of-the-art
transformer-based NLP models, including BERT and RoBERTa, to extract SBDoH
concepts from clinical narratives, applied the best performing model to extract
SBDoH concepts on a lung cancer screening patient cohort, and examined the
difference of SBDoH information between NLP extracted results and structured
EHRs (SBDoH information captured in standard vocabularies such as the
International Classification of Diseases codes). The experimental results show
that the BERT-based NLP model achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of
0.8791 and 0.8999, respectively. The comparison between NLP extracted SBDoH
information and structured EHRs in the lung cancer patient cohort of 864
patients with 161,933 various types of clinical notes showed that much more
detailed information about smoking, education, and employment were only
captured in clinical narratives and that it is necessary to use both clinical
narratives and structured EHRs to construct a more complete picture of
patients' SBDoH factors.]]></summary>

this paper, we propose a Position-Guided Contributive Distribution (PGCD) unit.
It achieves a position-dependent contributive pattern and generates
aspect-related statement feature for ABSA task. Quoted from Shapley Value, PGCD
can gain position-guided contextual contribution and enhance the aspect-based
representation. Furthermore, the unit can be used for improving effects on
multimodal ABSA task, whose datasets restructured by ourselves. Extensive
experiments on both text and text-audio level using dataset (SemEval) show that

discover and purchase products online. With increasing concerns on the
transparency and accountability of AI systems, studies on explainable
information retrieval has received more and more attention in the research
community. Interestingly, in the domain of e-commerce, despite the extensive
studies on explainable product recommendation, the studies of explainable
product search is still in an early stage. In this paper, we study how to
construct effective explainable product search by comparing model-agnostic
explanation paradigms with model-intrinsic paradigms and analyzing the
important factors that determine the performance of product search
explanations. We propose an explainable product search model with
model-intrinsic interpretability and conduct crowdsourcing to compare it with
the state-of-the-art explainable product search model with model-agnostic
interpretability. We observe that both paradigms have their own advantages and
the effectiveness of search explanations on different properties are affected
by different factors. For example, explanation fidelity is more important for
user's overall satisfaction on the system while explanation novelty may be more
useful in attracting user purchases. These findings could have important
implications for the future studies and design of explainable product search
engines.]]></summary>

choices for explaining natural language model predictions with relative word

demonstrates how interpretations can be manipulated by making simple word
perturbations on an input text. Via a small portion of word-level swaps, these
adversarial perturbations aim to make the resulting text semantically and

interpretations). Simultaneously, the generated examples achieve the same
prediction label as the seed yet are given a substantially different
explanation by the interpretation methods. Our experiments generate fragile
interpretations to attack two SOTA interpretation methods, across three popular
Transformer models and on two different NLP datasets. We observe that the rank
order correlation drops by over 20% when less than 10% of words are perturbed

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Handwritten mathematical expressions (HMEs) contain ambiguities in their
interpretations, even for humans sometimes. Several math symbols are very
similar in the writing style, such as dot and comma or 0, O, and o, which is a
challenge for HME recognition systems to handle without using contextual
information. To address this problem, this paper presents a Transformer-based
Math Language Model (TMLM). Based on the self-attention mechanism, the
high-level representation of an input token in a sequence of tokens is computed
by how it is related to the previous tokens. Thus, TMLM can capture long
dependencies and correlations among symbols and relations in a mathematical
expression (ME). We trained the proposed language model using a corpus of
approximately 70,000 LaTeX sequences provided in CROHME 2016. TMLM achieved the
perplexity of 4.42, which outperformed the previous math language models, i.e.,
the N-gram and recurrent neural network-based language models. In addition, we
combine TMLM into a stochastic context-free grammar-based HME recognition
system using a weighting parameter to re-rank the top-10 best candidates. The
expression rates on the testing sets of CROHME 2016 and CROHME 2019 were
improved by 2.97 and 0.83 percentage points, respectively.]]></summary>

conditioning a language model (LM) on the domain of the input text. A DEMix
layer is a collection of expert feedforward networks, each specialized to a
domain, that makes the LM modular: experts can be mixed, added or removed after
initial training. Extensive experiments with autoregressive transformer LMs (up
to 1.3B parameters) show that DEMix layers reduce test-time perplexity,
increase training efficiency, and enable rapid adaptation with little overhead.
We show that mixing experts during inference, using a parameter-free weighted
ensemble, allows the model to better generalize to heterogeneous or unseen
domains. We also show that experts can be added to iteratively incorporate new
domains without forgetting older ones, and that experts can be removed to
restrict access to unwanted domains, without additional training. Overall,
these results demonstrate benefits of explicitly conditioning on textual
domains during language modeling.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being light-weight and cost-effective, IR-based approaches for bug
localization have shown promise in finding software bugs. However, the accuracy
of these approaches heavily depends on their used bug reports. A significant
number of bug reports contain only plain natural language texts. According to
existing studies, IR-based approaches cannot perform well when they use these
bug reports as search queries. On the other hand, there is a piece of recent
evidence that suggests that even these natural language-only reports contain
enough good keywords that could help localize the bugs successfully. On one
hand, these findings suggest that natural language-only bug reports might be a
sufficient source for good query keywords. On the other hand, they cast serious
doubt on the query selection practices in the IR-based bug localization. In
this article, we attempted to clear the sky on this aspect by conducting an
in-depth empirical study that critically examines the state-of-the-art query
selection practices in IR-based bug localization. In particular, we use a
dataset of 2,320 bug reports, employ ten existing approaches from the
literature, exploit the Genetic Algorithm-based approach to construct optimal,
near-optimal search queries from these bug reports, and then answer three
research questions. We confirmed that the state-of-the-art query construction
approaches are indeed not sufficient for constructing appropriate queries (for
bug localization) from certain natural language-only bug reports although they
contain such queries. We also demonstrate that optimal queries and non-optimal
queries chosen from bug report texts are significantly different in terms of
several keyword characteristics, which has led us to actionable insights.
Furthermore, we demonstrate 27%--34% improvement in the performance of
non-optimal queries through the application of our actionable insights to them.]]></summary>

which is a crucial step in integrating multiple KGs. However, most existing EA
methods have poor scalability and are unable to cope with large-scale datasets.
We summarize three issues leading to such high time-space complexity in
existing EA methods: (1) Inefficient graph encoders, (2) Dilemma of negative
sampling, and (3) "Catastrophic forgetting" in semi-supervised learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel EA method with three new
components to enable high Performance, high Scalability, and high Robustness
(PSR): (1) Simplified graph encoder with relational graph sampling, (2)
Symmetric negative-free alignment loss, and (3) Incremental semi-supervised
learning. Furthermore, we conduct detailed experiments on several public

The experimental results show that PSR not only surpasses the previous SOTA in

concern is whether it is responsible to use these models. Concerns such as

Furthermore, when models do fail, providing explanations is paramount for
accountability purposes. To this end, interpretability serves to provide these
explanations in terms that are understandable to humans. Central to what is
understandable is how explanations are communicated. Therefore, this survey
provides a categorization of how recent interpretability methods communicate
explanations and discusses the methods in depth. Furthermore, the survey
focuses on post-hoc methods, which provide explanations after a model is
learned and generally model-agnostic. A common concern for this class of
methods is whether they accurately reflect the model. Hence, how these post-hoc

to their capability to capture the potential relationships between entities.
However, most of the existing methods only construct a single global item graph
shared by all the users and regrettably ignore the diverse tastes between
different user groups. Inspired by the success of local models for
recommendation, this paper provides the first attempt to investigate multiple
local item graphs along with a global item graph for graph-based recommendation
models. We argue that recommendation on global and local graphs outperforms
that on a single global graph or multiple local graphs. Specifically, we
propose a novel graph-based recommendation model named GLIMG (Global and Local
IteM Graphs), which simultaneously captures both the global and local user
tastes. By integrating the global and local graphs into an adapted
semi-supervised learning model, users' preferences on items are propagated
globally and locally. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Traditional industrial recommenders are usually trained on a single business
domain and then serve for this domain. However, in large commercial platforms,
it is often the case that the recommenders need to make click-through rate
(CTR) predictions for multiple business domains. Different domains have
overlapping user groups and items. Thus, there exist commonalities. Since the
specific user groups have disparity and the user behaviors may change in
various business domains, there also have distinctions. The distinctions result
in domain-specific data distributions, making it hard for a single shared model
to work well on all domains. To learn an effective and efficient CTR model to
handle multiple domains simultaneously, we present Star Topology Adaptive
Recommender (STAR). Concretely, STAR has the star topology, which consists of
the shared centered parameters and domain-specific parameters. The shared
parameters are applied to learn commonalities of all domains, and the
domain-specific parameters capture domain distinction for more refined
prediction. Given requests from different business domains, STAR can adapt its
parameters conditioned on the domain characteristics. The experimental result
from production data validates the superiority of the proposed STAR model.
Since 2020, STAR has been deployed in the display advertising system of
Alibaba, obtaining averaging 8.0% improvement on CTR and 6.0% on RPM (Revenue
Per Mille).]]></summary>

capture the associations between them. Prior studies show that pre-trained V&L
models can significantly improve the model performance for downstream tasks

when applied in the medical domain (e.g., on X-ray images and clinical notes)

the visual representation in general V&L models is not suitable for processing
medical data. To overcome this limitation, we propose BERTHop, a
transformer-based model based on PixelHop++ and VisualBERT, for better
capturing the associations between the two modalities. Experiments on the OpenI

BERTHop achieves an average Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 98.12% which is 1.62%

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning to rank systems has become an important aspect of our daily life.
However, the implicit user feedback that is used to train many learning to rank
models is usually noisy and suffered from user bias (i.e., position bias).
Thus, obtaining an unbiased model using biased feedback has become an important
research field for IR. Existing studies on unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) can
be generalized into two families-algorithms that attain unbiasedness with
logged data, offline learning, and algorithms that achieve unbiasedness by
estimating unbiased parameters with real-time user interactions, namely online
learning. While there exist many algorithms from both families, there lacks a
unified way to compare and benchmark them. As a result, it can be challenging
for researchers to choose the right technique for their problems or for people
who are new to the field to learn and understand existing algorithms. To solve
this problem, we introduced ULTRA, which is a flexible, extensible, and easily
configure ULTR toolbox. Its key features include support for multiple ULTR
algorithms with configurable hyperparameters, a variety of built-in click
models that can be used separately to simulate clicks, different ranking model
architecture and evaluation metrics, and simple learning to rank pipeline
creation. In this paper, we discuss the general framework of ULTR, briefly
describe the algorithms in ULTRA, detailed the structure, and pipeline of the
toolbox. We experimented on all the algorithms supported by ultra and showed
that the toolbox performance is reasonable. Our toolbox is an important
resource for researchers to conduct experiments on ULTR algorithms with
different configurations as well as testing their own algorithms with the
supported features.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prediction over tabular data is an essential task in many data science
applications such as recommender systems, online advertising, medical
treatment, etc. Tabular data is structured into rows and columns, with each row
as a data sample and each column as a feature attribute. Both the columns and
rows of the tabular data carry useful patterns that could improve the model
prediction performance. However, most existing models focus on the cross-column
patterns yet overlook the cross-row patterns as they deal with single samples
independently. In this work, we propose a general learning framework named
Retrieval & Interaction Machine (RIM) that fully exploits both cross-row and
cross-column patterns among tabular data. Specifically, RIM first leverages
search engine techniques to efficiently retrieve useful rows of the table to
assist the label prediction of the target row, then uses feature interaction
networks to capture the cross-column patterns among the target row and the
retrieved rows so as to make the final label prediction. We conduct extensive
experiments on 11 datasets of three important tasks, i.e., CTR prediction
(classification), top-n recommendation (ranking) and rating prediction
(regression). Experimental results show that RIM achieves significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art and various baselines, demonstrating the
superiority and efficacy of RIM.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, we have witnessed the bloom of neural ranking models in the
information retrieval (IR) field. So far, much effort has been devoted to
developing effective neural ranking models that can generalize well on new
data. There has been less attention paid to the robustness perspective. Unlike
the effectiveness which is about the average performance of a system under
normal purpose, robustness cares more about the system performance in the worst
case or under malicious operations instead. When a new technique enters into
the real-world application, it is critical to know not only how it works in
average, but also how would it behave in abnormal situations. So we raise the
question in this work: Are neural ranking models robust? To answer this
question, firstly, we need to clarify what we refer to when we talk about the
robustness of ranking models in IR. We show that robustness is actually a
multi-dimensional concept and there are three ways to define it in IR: 1) The
performance variance under the independent and identically distributed (I.I.D.)
setting; 2) The out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability; and 3) The
defensive ability against adversarial operations. The latter two definitions
can be further specified into two different perspectives respectively, leading
to 5 robustness tasks in total. Based on this taxonomy, we build corresponding
benchmark datasets, design empirical experiments, and systematically analyze
the robustness of several representative neural ranking models against
traditional probabilistic ranking models and learning-to-rank (LTR) models. The
empirical results show that there is no simple answer to our question. While
neural ranking models are less robust against other IR models in most cases,
some of them can still win 1 out of 5 tasks. This is the first comprehensive
study on the robustness of neural ranking models.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Question Answering (QA), a popular and promising technique for intelligent
information access, faces a dilemma about data as most other AI techniques. On
one hand, modern QA methods rely on deep learning models which are typically
data-hungry. Therefore, it is expected to collect and fuse all the available QA
datasets together in a common site for developing a powerful QA model. On the
other hand, real-world QA datasets are typically distributed in the form of
isolated islands belonging to different parties. Due to the increasing
awareness of privacy security, it is almost impossible to integrate the data
scattered around, or the cost is prohibited. A possible solution to this
dilemma is a new approach known as federated learning, which is a
privacy-preserving machine learning technique over distributed datasets. In
this work, we propose to adopt federated learning for QA with the special
concern on the statistical heterogeneity of the QA data. Here the heterogeneity
refers to the fact that annotated QA data are typically with non-identical and
independent distribution (non-IID) and unbalanced sizes in practice.
Traditional federated learning methods may sacrifice the accuracy of individual
models under the heterogeneous situation. To tackle this problem, we propose a
novel Federated Matching framework for QA, named FedMatch, with a
backbone-patch architecture. The shared backbone is to distill the common
knowledge of all the participants while the private patch is a compact and
efficient module to retain the domain information for each participant. To
facilitate the evaluation, we build a benchmark collection based on several QA
datasets from different domains to simulate the heterogeneous situation in
practice. Empirical studies demonstrate that our model can achieve significant
improvements against the baselines over all the datasets.]]></summary>

infilling, i.e., to generate a polyphonic music sequence that fills in the gap
between given past and future contexts. While existing approaches can only fill
in a short segment with a fixed number of notes, or a fixed time span between
the past and future contexts, our model can infill a variable number of notes
(up to 128) for different time spans. We achieve so with three major technical
contributions. First, we adapt XLNet, an autoregressive model originally
proposed for unsupervised model pre-training, to music score infilling. Second,
we propose a new, musically specialized positional encoding called relative bar
encoding that better informs the model of notes' position within the past and
future context. Third, to capitalize relative bar encoding, we perform
look-ahead onset prediction to predict the onset of a note one time step before
predicting the other attributes of the note. We compare our proposed model with
two strong baselines and show that our model is superior in both objective and
subjective analyses.]]></summary>

based on a prefix typed by customer. Autocomplete has been a core feature of
commercial search engine. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware
neural network based pairwise ranker (DeepPLTR) to improve AC ranking, DeepPLTR
leverages contextual and behavioral features to rank queries by minimizing a
pairwise loss, based on a fully-connected neural network structure. Compared to
LambdaMART ranker, DeepPLTR shows +3.90% MeanReciprocalRank (MRR) lift in
offline evaluation, and yielded +0.06% (p < 0.1) Gross Merchandise Value (GMV)
lift in an Amazon's online A/B experiment.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image smoothing is a fundamental task in signal processing. For such task,
box filter is well-known. However, box filter can not keep some features of the
signal, such as edges, corners and the jump in the step function. In this
paper, we present a one-sided box filter that can smooth the signal but keep
the discontinuous features in the signal. More specifically, we perform box
filter on eight one-sided windows, leading to a one-sided box filter that can
preserve corners and edges. Our filter inherits the constant $O(1)$
computational complexity of the original box filter with respect to the window
size and also the linear $O(N)$ computational complexity with respect to the
total number of samples. We performance several experiments to show the
efficiency and effectiveness of this filter. We further compare our filter with
other the-state-of-the-art edge preserving methods. Our filter can be deployed
in a large range of applications where the classical box filter is adopted.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binaural audio gives the listener the feeling of being in the recording place
and enhances the immersive experience if coupled with AR/VR. But the problem
with binaural audio recording is that it requires a specialized setup which is
not possible to fabricate within handheld devices as compared to traditional
mono audio that can be recorded with a single microphone. In order to overcome
this drawback, prior works have tried to uplift the mono recorded audio to
binaural audio as a post processing step conditioning on the visual input. But
all the prior approaches missed other most important information required for
the task, i.e. distance of different sound producing objects from the recording
setup. In this work, we argue that the depth map of the scene can act as a
proxy for encoding distance information of objects in the scene and show that
adding depth features along with image features improves the performance both
qualitatively and quantitatively. We propose a novel encoder-decoder
architecture, where we use a hierarchical attention mechanism to encode the
image and depth feature extracted from individual transformer backbone, with
audio features at each layer of the decoder.]]></summary>
