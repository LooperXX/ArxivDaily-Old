        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the image classification task, the most common approach is to resize all
images in a dataset to a unique shape, while reducing their precision to a size
which facilitates experimentation at scale. This practice has benefits from a
computational perspective, but it entails negative side-effects on performance
due to loss of information and image deformation. In this work we introduce the
MAMe dataset, an image classification dataset with remarkable high resolution
and variable shape properties. The goal of MAMe is to provide a tool for
studying the impact of such properties in image classification, while
motivating research in the field. The MAMe dataset contains thousands of
artworks from three different museums, and proposes a classification task
consisting on differentiating between 29 mediums (i.e. materials and
techniques) supervised by art experts. After reviewing the singularity of MAMe
in the context of current image classification tasks, a thorough description of
the task is provided, together with dataset statistics. Experiments are
conducted to evaluate the impact of using high resolution images, variable
shape inputs and both properties at the same time. Results illustrate the
positive impact in performance when using high resolution images, while
highlighting the lack of solutions to exploit variable shapes. An additional
experiment exposes the distinctiveness between the MAMe dataset and the
prototypical ImageNet dataset. Finally, the baselines are inspected using
explainability methods and expert knowledge, to gain insights on the challenges
that remain ahead.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many real-world problems, complex dependencies are present both among
samples and among features. The Kronecker sum or the Cartesian product of two
graphs, each modeling dependencies across features and across samples, has been
used as an inverse covariance matrix for a matrix-variate Gaussian
distribution, as an alternative to a Kronecker-product inverse covariance
matrix, due to its more intuitive sparse structure. However, the existing
methods for sparse Kronecker-sum inverse covariance estimation are limited in
that they do not scale to more than a few hundred features and samples and that
the unidentifiable parameters pose challenges in estimation. In this paper, we
introduce EiGLasso, a highly scalable method for sparse Kronecker-sum inverse
covariance estimation, based on Newton's method combined with
eigendecomposition of the two graphs for exploiting the structure of Kronecker
sum. EiGLasso further reduces computation time by approximating the Hessian
based on the eigendecomposition of the sample and feature graphs. EiGLasso
achieves quadratic convergence with the exact Hessian and linear convergence
with the approximate Hessian. We describe a simple new approach to estimating
the unidentifiable parameters that generalizes the existing methods. On
simulated and real-world data, we demonstrate that EiGLasso achieves two to
three orders-of-magnitude speed-up compared to the existing methods.]]></summary>

application of these areas to queueing systems.

We prove that the MaxWeight and BackPressure policies are an application of
Blackwell's Approachability Theorem. This connects queueing theoretic results
with adversarial learning. We then discuss the requirements of statistical
learning for service parameter estimation. As an example, we show how queue
size regret can be bounded when applying a perceptron algorithm to classify
service. Next, we discuss the role of state information in improved decision

Manually labeling data is a very expensive and daunting task. This calls for
unsupervised learning techniques that are powerful enough to achieve comparable
results as semi-supervised/supervised techniques. Contrastive self-supervised
learning has emerged as a powerful direction, in some cases outperforming
supervised techniques. In this study, we propose, SelfGNN, a novel contrastive
self-supervised graph neural network (GNN) without relying on explicit
contrastive terms. We leverage Batch Normalization, which introduces implicit
contrastive terms, without sacrificing performance. Furthermore, as data
augmentation is key in contrastive learning, we introduce four feature
augmentation (FA) techniques for graphs. Though graph topological augmentation
(TA) is commonly used, our empirical findings show that FA perform as good as
TA. Moreover, FA incurs no computational overhead, unlike TA, which often has
O(N^3) time complexity, N-number of nodes. Our empirical evaluation on seven
publicly available real-world data shows that, SelfGNN is powerful and leads to
a performance comparable with SOTA supervised GNNs and always better than SOTA
semi-supervised and unsupervised GNNs. The source code is available at

However, existing one-shot algorithms only support specific models and do not

due to the `reality gap' where the simulator is unable to accurately capture
the dynamics and visual properties of the real world. Current approaches to
tackle this problem, such as domain randomization, require prior knowledge and
engineering to determine how much to randomize system parameters in order to
learn a policy that is robust to sim-to-real transfer while also not being too
conservative. We propose a method for automatically tuning simulator system
parameters to match the real world using only raw RGB images of the real world
without the need to define rewards or estimate state. Our key insight is to
reframe the auto-tuning of parameters as a search problem where we iteratively
shift the simulation system parameters to approach the real-world system
parameters. We propose a Search Param Model (SPM) that, given a sequence of
observations and actions and a set of system parameters, predicts whether the
given parameters are higher or lower than the true parameters used to generate
the observations. We evaluate our method on multiple robotic control tasks in
both sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfer, demonstrating significant improvement

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been attached great importance due to
their biological plausibility and high energy-efficiency on neuromorphic chips.
As these chips are usually resource-constrained, the compression of SNNs is
thus crucial along the road of practical use of SNNs. Most existing methods
directly apply pruning approaches in artificial neural networks (ANNs) to SNNs,
which ignore the difference between ANNs and SNNs, thus limiting the
performance of the pruned SNNs. Besides, these methods are only suitable for
shallow SNNs. In this paper, inspired by synaptogenesis and synapse elimination
in the neural system, we propose gradient rewiring (Grad R), a joint learning
algorithm of connectivity and weight for SNNs, that enables us to seamlessly
optimize network structure without retrain. Our key innovation is to redefine
the gradient to a new synaptic parameter, allowing better exploration of
network structures by taking full advantage of the competition between pruning
and regrowth of connections. The experimental results show that the proposed
method achieves minimal loss of SNNs' performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset
so far. Moreover, it reaches a $\sim$3.5% accuracy loss under unprecedented
0.73% connectivity, which reveals remarkable structure refining capability in
SNNs. Our work suggests that there exists extremely high redundancy in deep
SNNs. Our codes are available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large ride-hailing platforms, such as DiDi, Uber and Lyft, connect tens of
thousands of vehicles in a city to millions of ride demands throughout the day,
providing great promises for improving transportation efficiency through the
tasks of order dispatching and vehicle repositioning. Existing studies,
however, usually consider the two tasks in simplified settings that hardly
address the complex interactions between the two, the real-time fluctuations
between supply and demand, and the necessary coordinations due to the
large-scale nature of the problem. In this paper we propose a unified
value-based dynamic learning framework (V1D3) for tackling both tasks. At the
center of the framework is a globally shared value function that is updated
continuously using online experiences generated from real-time platform
transactions. To improve the sample-efficiency and the robustness, we further
propose a novel periodic ensemble method combining the fast online learning
with a large-scale offline training scheme that leverages the abundant
historical driver trajectory data. This allows the proposed framework to adapt
quickly to the highly dynamic environment, to generalize robustly to recurrent
patterns and to drive implicit coordinations among the population of managed
vehicles. Extensive experiments based on real-world datasets show considerably
improvements over other recently proposed methods on both tasks. Particularly,
V1D3 outperforms the first prize winners of both dispatching and repositioning
tracks in the KDD Cup 2020 RL competition, achieving state-of-the-art results
on improving both total driver income and user experience related metrics.]]></summary>

obtained to determine the extent of lung disease and are a valuable source of
data for creating artificial intelligence models. Most work to date assessing
disease severity on chest imaging has focused on segmenting computed tomography
(CT) images; however, given that CTs are performed much less frequently than
chest X-rays for COVID-19 patients, automated lung lesion segmentation on chest
X-rays could be clinically valuable. There currently exists a universal
shortage of chest X-rays with ground truth COVID-19 lung lesion annotations,
and manually contouring lung opacities is a tedious, labor-intensive task. To
accelerate severity detection and augment the amount of publicly available
chest X-ray training data for supervised deep learning (DL) models, we leverage
existing annotated CT images to generate frontal projection "chest X-ray"
images for training COVID-19 chest X-ray models. In this paper, we propose an
automated pipeline for segmentation of COVID-19 lung lesions on chest X-rays
comprised of a Mask R-CNN trained on a mixed dataset of open-source chest
X-rays and coronal X-ray projections computed from annotated volumetric CTs. On
a test set containing 40 chest X-rays of COVID-19 positive patients, our model
achieved IoU scores of 0.81 $\pm$ 0.03 and 0.79 $\pm$ 0.03 when trained on a
dataset of 60 chest X-rays and on a mixed dataset of 10 chest X-rays and 50
projections from CTs, respectively. Our model far outperforms current baselines
with limited supervised training and may assist in automated COVID-19 severity
quantification on chest X-rays.]]></summary>

society, modern machine learning models still cannot code solutions to basic
problems. It can be difficult to accurately assess code generation performance,
and there has been surprisingly little work on evaluating code generation in a
way that is both flexible and rigorous. To meet this challenge, we introduce
APPS, a benchmark for code generation. Unlike prior work in more restricted
settings, our benchmark measures the ability of models to take an arbitrary
natural language specification and generate Python code fulfilling this
specification. Similar to how companies assess candidate software developers,
we then evaluate models by checking their generated code on test cases. Our
benchmark includes 10,000 problems, which range from having simple one-line
solutions to being substantial algorithmic challenges. We fine-tune large
language models on both GitHub and our training set, and we find that the
prevalence of syntax errors is decreasing exponentially. Recent models such as
GPT-Neo can pass approximately 15% of the test cases of introductory problems,
so we find that machine learning models are beginning to learn how to code. As
the social significance of automatic code generation increases over the coming
years, our benchmark can provide an important measure for tracking
advancements.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recommendation systems, the existence of the missing-not-at-random (MNAR)
problem results in the selection bias issue, degrading the recommendation
performance ultimately. A common practice to address MNAR is to treat missing
entries from the so-called "exposure" perspective, i.e., modeling how an item
is exposed (provided) to a user. Most of the existing approaches use heuristic
models or re-weighting strategy on observed ratings to mimic the
missing-at-random setting. However, little research has been done to reveal how
the ratings are missing from a causal perspective. To bridge the gap, we
propose an unbiased and robust method called DENC (De-bias Network Confounding
in Recommendation) inspired by confounder analysis in causal inference. In
general, DENC provides a causal analysis on MNAR from both the inherent factors
(e.g., latent user or item factors) and auxiliary network's perspective.
Particularly, the proposed exposure model in DENC can control the social
network confounder meanwhile preserves the observed exposure information. We
also develop a deconfounding model through the balanced representation learning
to retain the primary user and item features, which enables DENC generalize
well on the rating prediction. Extensive experiments on three datasets validate
that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.]]></summary>

we introduce an approach, Mondegreen, to correct voice queries in text space

on-device) considerations. We focus on voice queries transcribed via several
proprietary commercial ASR systems. These queries come from users making
internet, or online service search queries. We first present an analysis
showing how different the language distribution coming from user voice queries
is from that in traditional text corpora used to train off-the-shelf ASR
systems. We then demonstrate that Mondegreen can achieve significant
improvements in increased user interaction by correcting user voice queries in
one of the largest search systems in Google. Finally, we see Mondegreen as
complementing existing highly-optimized production ASR systems, which may not
be frequently retrained and thus lag behind due to vocabulary drifts.]]></summary>

model that considers real-world phenomena in many recommender systems: (i) the
learning agent cannot pull the arms by itself and thus has to offer rewards to
users to incentivize arm-pulling indirectly; and (ii) if users with specific
arm preferences are well rewarded, they induce a "self-reinforcing" effect in
the sense that they will attract more users of similar arm preferences. Besides
addressing the tradeoff of exploration and exploitation, another key feature of
this new MAB model is to balance reward and incentivizing payment. The goal of
the agent is to maximize the total reward over a fixed time horizon $T$ with a
low total payment. Our contributions in this paper are two-fold: (i) We propose
a new MAB model with random arm selection that considers the relationship of
users' self-reinforcing preferences and incentives; and (ii) We leverage the
properties of a multi-color Polya urn with nonlinear feedback model to propose
two MAB policies termed "At-Least-$n$ Explore-Then-Commit" and "UCB-List". We
prove that both policies achieve $O(log T)$ expected regret with $O(log T)$

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Automatic program repair (APR) is crucial to improve software reliability.
Recently, neural machine translation (NMT) techniques have been used to fix
software bugs automatically. While promising, these approaches have two major
limitations. Their search space often does not contain the correct fix, and
their search strategy ignores software knowledge such as strict code syntax.
Due to these limitations, existing NMT-based techniques underperform the best
template-based approaches.

We propose CURE, a new NMT-based APR technique with three major novelties.
First, CURE pre-trains a programming language (PL) model on a large software
codebase to learn developer-like source code before the APR task. Second, CURE
designs a new code-aware search strategy that finds more correct fixes by
focusing on compilable patches and patches that are close in length to the
buggy code. Finally, CURE uses a subword tokenization technique to generate a
smaller search space that contains more correct fixes.

Our evaluation on two widely-used benchmarks shows that CURE correctly fixes
57 Defects4J bugs and 26 QuixBugs bugs, outperforming all existing APR

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Determining the noise parameters of a Kalman Filter (KF) has been studied for
decades. A huge body of research focuses on the task of estimation of the noise
under various conditions, since precise noise estimation is considered
equivalent to minimization of the filtering errors. However, we show that even
a small violation of the KF assumptions can significantly modify the effective
noise, breaking the equivalence between the tasks and making noise estimation
an inferior strategy. We show that such violations are very common, and are
often not trivial to handle or even notice. Consequentially, we argue that a
robust solution is needed - rather than choosing a dedicated model per problem.
To that end, we apply gradient-based optimization to the filtering errors
directly, with relation to a simple and efficient parameterization of the
symmetric and positive-definite parameters of KF. In radar tracking and video
tracking, we show that the optimization improves both the accuracy of KF and
its robustness to design decisions. In addition, we demonstrate how an
optimized neural network model can seem to reduce the errors significantly
compared to a KF - and how this reduction vanishes once the KF is optimized
similarly. This indicates how complicated models can be wrongly identified as
superior to KF, while in fact they were merely more optimized.]]></summary>

feature selection methods instead of explicitly restricting relevant features

this paper aims to combine the best of both worlds: self-attention and

Self-Attentive Factorized Instance Normalization (SAFIN). SAFIN is essentially
a spatially adaptive normalization module whose parameters are inferred through
attention on the content and style image. We demonstrate that plugging SAFIN
into the base network of another state-of-the-art method results in enhanced

from automatic speech recognition (ASR) models and achieve a lower word error
rate (WER) than original ASR outputs. Previous works usually use a
sequence-to-sequence model to correct an ASR output sentence autoregressively,
which causes large latency and cannot be deployed in online ASR services. A
straightforward solution to reduce latency, inspired by non-autoregressive
(NAR) neural machine translation, is to use an NAR sequence generation model
for ASR error correction, which, however, comes at the cost of significantly
increased ASR error rate. In this paper, observing distinctive error patterns
and correction operations (i.e., insertion, deletion, and substitution) in ASR,
we propose FastCorrect, a novel NAR error correction model based on edit
alignment. In training, FastCorrect aligns each source token from an ASR output
sentence to the target tokens from the corresponding ground-truth sentence
based on the edit distance between the source and target sentences, and
extracts the number of target tokens corresponding to each source token during
edition/correction, which is then used to train a length predictor and to
adjust the source tokens to match the length of the target sentence for
parallel generation. In inference, the token number predicted by the length
predictor is used to adjust the source tokens for target sequence generation.
Experiments on the public AISHELL-1 dataset and an internal industrial-scale
ASR dataset show the effectiveness of FastCorrect for ASR error correction: 1)
it speeds up the inference by 6-9 times and maintains the accuracy (8-14% WER
reduction) compared with the autoregressive correction model; and 2) it
outperforms the accuracy of popular NAR models adopted in neural machine
translation by a large margin.]]></summary>

means to accelerate computations with model order reduction techniques and as
universal models for a wide variety of materials. However, the major
disadvantage of neural networks remains: their numerous parameters are
challenging to interpret and explain. Thus, neural networks are often labeled
as black boxes, and their results often elude human interpretation. In
mechanics, the new and active field of physics-informed neural networks
attempts to mitigate this disadvantage by designing deep neural networks on the
basis of mechanical knowledge. By using this a priori knowledge, deeper and
more complex neural networks became feasible, since the mechanical assumptions
could be explained. However, the internal reasoning and explanation of neural
network parameters remain mysterious.

Complementary to the physics-informed approach, we propose a first step
towards a physics-informing approach, which explains neural networks trained on
mechanical data a posteriori. This novel explainable artificial intelligence
approach aims at elucidating the black box of neural networks and their
high-dimensional representations. Therein, the principal component analysis
decorrelates the distributed representations in cell states of RNNs and allows
the comparison to known and fundamental functions. The novel approach is
supported by a systematic hyperparameter search strategy that identifies the
best neural network architectures and training parameters. The findings of
three case studies on fundamental constitutive models (hyperelasticity,
elastoplasticity, and viscoelasticity) imply that the proposed strategy can
help identify numerical and analytical closed-form solutions to characterize
new materials.]]></summary>

design an appropriate end-to-end learning pipeline. Neuro-Symbolic Learning,
divide the process into sub-symbolic perception and symbolic reasoning, trying
to utilise data-driven machine learning and knowledge-driven reasoning
simultaneously. However, they suffer from the exponential computational
complexity within the interface between these two components, where the
sub-symbolic learning model lacks direct supervision, and the symbolic model
lacks accurate input facts. Hence, most of them assume the existence of a
strong symbolic knowledge base and only learn the perception model while
avoiding a crucial problem: where does the knowledge come from? In this paper,
we present Abductive Meta-Interpretive Learning ($Meta_{Abd}$) that unites
abduction and induction to learn neural networks and induce logic theories
jointly from raw data. Experimental results demonstrate that $Meta_{Abd}$ not
only outperforms the compared systems in predictive accuracy and data
efficiency but also induces logic programs that can be re-used as background
knowledge in subsequent learning tasks. To the best of our knowledge,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Machine learning on graphs has been extensively studied in both academic and
industry. However, as the literature on graph learning booms with a vast number
of emerging methods and techniques, it becomes increasingly difficult to
manually design the optimal machine learning algorithm for different
graph-related tasks. To solve this critical challenge, automated machine
learning (AutoML) on graphs which combines the strength of graph machine
learning and AutoML together, is gaining attention from the research community.
Therefore, we comprehensively survey AutoML on graphs in this paper, primarily
focusing on hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search
(NAS) for graph machine learning. We further overview libraries related to
automated graph machine learning and in-depth discuss AutoGL, the first
dedicated open-source library for AutoML on graphs. In the end, we share our
insights on future research directions for automated graph machine learning.
This paper is the first systematic and comprehensive review of automated
machine learning on graphs to the best of our knowledge.]]></summary>

symptoms shown by patients are not consistent, making it difficult to diagnose
in the process of clinical practice and pathological research. Although
researchers hope that artificial intelligence can contribute to the diagnosis
and treatment of depression, the traditional centralized machine learning needs
to aggregate patient data, and the data privacy of patients with mental illness
needs to be strictly confidential, which hinders machine learning algorithms
clinical application. To solve the problem of privacy of the medical history of
patients with depression, we implement federated learning to analyze and
diagnose depression. First, we propose a general multi-view federated learning
framework using multi-source data, which can extend any traditional machine
learning model to support federated learning across different institutions or
parties. Secondly, we adopt late fusion methods to solve the problem of
inconsistent time series of multi-view data. Finally, we compare the federated
framework with other cooperative learning frameworks in performance and discuss
the related results.]]></summary>

aspire to make the most of their data, demand for machine learning tools has
spurred researchers to explore the possibilities of automated machine learning
(AutoML). AutoML tools aim to make machine learning accessible for non-machine
learning experts (domain experts), to improve the efficiency of machine
learning, and to accelerate machine learning research. But although automation
and efficiency are among AutoML's main selling points, the process still
requires human involvement at a number of vital steps, including understanding
the attributes of domain-specific data, defining prediction problems, creating
a suitable training data set, and selecting a promising machine learning
technique. These steps often require a prolonged back-and-forth that makes this
process inefficient for domain experts and data scientists alike, and keeps
so-called AutoML systems from being truly automatic. In this review article, we
introduce a new classification system for AutoML systems, using a seven-tiered
schematic to distinguish these systems based on their level of autonomy. We
begin by describing what an end-to-end machine learning pipeline actually looks
like, and which subtasks of the machine learning pipeline have been automated
so far. We highlight those subtasks which are still done manually - generally
by a data scientist - and explain how this limits domain experts' access to
machine learning. Next, we introduce our novel level-based taxonomy for AutoML
systems and define each level according to the scope of automation support
provided. Finally, we lay out a roadmap for the future, pinpointing the
research required to further automate the end-to-end machine learning pipeline
and discussing important challenges that stand in the way of this ambitious
goal.]]></summary>

approximation theory of neural networks, including the characterization of
approximation spaces, the determination of the metric entropy of these spaces,
and approximation rates of neural networks. For any activation function
$\sigma$, we show that the largest Banach space of functions which can be
efficiently approximated by the corresponding shallow neural networks is the
space whose norm is given by the gauge of the closed convex hull of the set
$\{\pm\sigma(\omega\cdot x + b)\}$. We characterize this space for the ReLU$^k$
and cosine activation functions and, in particular, show that the resulting
gauge space is equivalent to the spectral Barron space if $\sigma=\cos$ and is
equivalent to the Barron space when $\sigma={\rm ReLU}$. Our main result
establishes the precise asymptotics of the $L^2$-metric entropy of the unit
ball of these guage spaces and, as a consequence, the optimal approximation
rates for shallow ReLU$^k$ networks. The sharpest previous results hold only in
the special case that $k=0$ and $d=2$, where the metric entropy has been
determined up to logarithmic factors. When $k > 0$ or $d > 2$, there is a
significant gap between the previous best upper and lower bounds. We close all
of these gaps and determine the precise asymptotics of the metric entropy for
all $k \geq 0$ and $d\geq 2$, including removing the logarithmic factors
previously mentioned. Finally, we use these results to quantify how much is
lost by Barron's spectral condition relative to the convex hull of
$\{\pm\sigma(\omega\cdot x + b)\}$ when $\sigma={\rm ReLU}^k$. Finally, we also
show that the orthogonal greedy algorithm can algorithmically realize the
improved approximation rates which have been derived.]]></summary>

50 years, owing to its board scientific and application interests. There are
two major types of modelling algorithm, template-free modelling and
template-based modelling, which is suitable for easy prediction tasks, and is
widely adopted in computer aided drug discoveries for drug design and
screening. Although it has been several decades since its first edition, the
current template-based modeling approach suffers from two important problems:
1) there are many missing regions in the template-query sequence alignment, and
2) the accuracy of the distance pairs from different regions of the template
varies, and this information is not well introduced into the modeling. To solve
the two problems, we propose a structural optimization process based on
template modelling, introducing two neural network models predict the distance
information of the missing regions and the accuracy of the distance pairs of
different regions in the template modeling structure. The predicted distances
and residue pairwise specific accuracy information are incorporated into the
potential energy function for structural optimization, which significantly
improves the qualities of the original template modelling decoys.]]></summary>

is a critical issue as it can lead to uncontrollable fires or even explosions.
Thermal anomaly detection can identify problematic battery packs that may
eventually undergo thermal runaway. However, there are common challenges like
data unavailability, environment and configuration variations, and battery
aging. We propose a data-driven method to detect battery thermal anomaly based
on comparing shape-similarity between thermal measurements. Based on their
shapes, the measurements are continuously being grouped into different
clusters. Anomaly is detected by monitoring deviations within the clusters.
Unlike model-based or other data-driven methods, the proposed method is robust
to data loss and requires minimal reference data for different pack
configurations. As the initial experimental results show, the method not only
can be more accurate than the onboard BMS and but also can detect unforeseen
anomalies at the early stage.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Catastrophic forgetting remains a severe hindrance to the broad application
of artificial neural networks (ANNs), however, it continues to be a poorly
understood phenomenon. Despite the extensive amount of work on catastrophic
forgetting, we argue that it is still unclear how exactly the phenomenon should
be quantified, and, moreover, to what degree all of the choices we make when
designing learning systems affect the amount of catastrophic forgetting. We use
various testbeds from the reinforcement learning and supervised learning
literature to (1) provide evidence that the choice of which modern
gradient-based optimization algorithm is used to train an ANN has a significant
impact on the amount of catastrophic forgetting and show that-surprisingly-in
many instances classical algorithms such as vanilla SGD experience less
catastrophic forgetting than the more modern algorithms such as Adam. We
empirically compare four different existing metrics for quantifying
catastrophic forgetting and (2) show that the degree to which the learning
systems experience catastrophic forgetting is sufficiently sensitive to the
metric used that a change from one principled metric to another is enough to
change the conclusions of a study dramatically. Our results suggest that a much
more rigorous experimental methodology is required when looking at catastrophic
forgetting. Based on our results, we recommend inter-task forgetting in
supervised learning must be measured with both retention and relearning metrics
concurrently, and intra-task forgetting in reinforcement learning must-at the
very least-be measured with pairwise interference.]]></summary>

we propose a learnable weighted concatenation, which not only improves the

system such that its evolution fits observational data. The physical model can
subsequently be evolved into the future to make predictions. This principle is
a cornerstone of large scale forecasting applications such as numerical weather
prediction. As such, it is implemented in current operational systems of
weather forecasting agencies across the globe. However, finding a good initial
state poses a difficult optimization problem in part due to the non-invertible
relationship between physical states and their corresponding observations. We
learn a mapping from observational data to physical states and show how it can
be used to improve optimizability. We employ this mapping in two ways: to
better initialize the non-convex optimization problem, and to reformulate the
objective function in better behaved physics space instead of observation
space. Our experimental results for the Lorenz96 model and a two-dimensional
turbulent fluid flow demonstrate that this procedure significantly improves

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tensor completion refers to the task of estimating the missing data from an
incomplete measurement or observation, which is a core problem frequently
arising from the areas of big data analysis, computer vision, and network
engineering. Due to the multidimensional nature of high-order tensors, the
matrix approaches, e.g., matrix factorization and direct matricization of
tensors, are often not ideal for tensor completion and recovery. In this paper,
we introduce a unified low-rank and sparse enhanced Tucker decomposition model
for tensor completion. Our model possesses a sparse regularization term to
promote a sparse core tensor of the Tucker decomposition, which is beneficial
for tensor data compression. Moreover, we enforce low-rank regularization terms
on factor matrices of the Tucker decomposition for inducing the low-rankness of
the tensor with a cheap computational cost. Numerically, we propose a
customized ADMM with enough easy subproblems to solve the underlying model. It
is remarkable that our model is able to deal with different types of real-world
data sets, since it exploits the potential periodicity and inherent correlation
properties appeared in tensors. A series of computational experiments on
real-world data sets, including internet traffic data sets, color images, and
face recognition, demonstrate that our model performs better than many existing
state-of-the-art matricization and tensorization approaches in terms of
achieving higher recovery accuracy.]]></summary>

of data can be collected through virtually unlimited interaction with the
environment, learning from limited interaction remains a key challenge. We
posit that an agent can learn more efficiently if we augment reward
maximization with self-supervised objectives based on structure in its visual
input and sequential interaction with the environment. Our method,
Self-Predictive Representations(SPR), trains an agent to predict its own latent
state representations multiple steps into the future. We compute target
representations for future states using an encoder which is an exponential
moving average of the agent's parameters and we make predictions using a
learned transition model. On its own, this future prediction objective
outperforms prior methods for sample-efficient deep RL from pixels. We further
improve performance by adding data augmentation to the future prediction loss,
which forces the agent's representations to be consistent across multiple views
of an observation. Our full self-supervised objective, which combines future
prediction and data augmentation, achieves a median human-normalized score of
0.415 on Atari in a setting limited to 100k steps of environment interaction,
which represents a 55% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.
Notably, even in this limited data regime, SPR exceeds expert human scores on 7
out of 26 games. The code associated with this work is available at

communication channel between the controller and the plant can be hijacked by a
malicious attacker. We assume the attacker learns the dynamics of the system
from observations, then overrides the controller's actuation signal, while
mimicking legitimate operation by providing fictitious sensor readings to the
controller. On the other hand, the controller is on a lookout to detect the
presence of the attacker and tries to enhance the detection performance by
carefully crafting its control signals. We study the trade-offs between the
information acquired by the attacker from observations, the detection
capabilities of the controller, and the control cost. Specifically, we provide
tight upper and lower bounds on the expected $\epsilon$-deception time, namely
the time required by the controller to make a decision regarding the presence
of an attacker with confidence at least $(1-\epsilon\log(1/\epsilon))$. We then
show a probabilistic lower bound on the time that must be spent by the attacker
learning the system, in order for the controller to have a given expected
$\epsilon$-deception time. We show that this bound is also order optimal, in
the sense that if the attacker satisfies it, then there exists a learning
algorithm with the given order expected deception time. Finally, we show a
lower bound on the expected energy expenditure required to guarantee detection
with confidence at least $1-\epsilon \log(1/\epsilon)$.]]></summary>

allow control of several applications by decoding neurophysiological phenomena,
which are usually recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) using a non-invasive
technique. Despite great advances in MI-based BCI, EEG rhythms are specific to
a subject and various changes over time. These issues point to significant
challenges to enhance the classification performance, especially in a
subject-independent manner. To overcome these challenges, we propose MIN2Net, a
novel end-to-end multi-task learning to tackle this task. We integrate deep
metric learning into a multi-task autoencoder to learn a compact and
discriminative latent representation from EEG and perform classification
simultaneously. This approach reduces the complexity in pre-processing, results
in significant performance improvement on EEG classification. Experimental
results in a subject-independent manner show that MIN2Net outperforms the
state-of-the-art techniques, achieving an F1-score improvement of 6.72%, and
2.23% on the SMR-BCI, and OpenBMI datasets, respectively. We demonstrate that
MIN2Net improves discriminative information in the latent representation. This

quantifying tissue susceptibility in various brain diseases. However, the
intrinsic ill-posed inverse problem relating the tissue phase to the underlying
susceptibility distribution affects the accuracy for quantifying tissue
susceptibility. Recently, deep learning has shown promising results to improve
accuracy by reducing the streaking artifacts. However, there exists a mismatch
between the observed phase and the theoretical forward phase estimated by the
susceptibility label. In this study, we proposed a model-based deep learning
architecture that followed the STI (susceptibility tensor imaging) physical
model, referred to as MoDL-QSM. Specifically, MoDL-QSM accounts for the
relationship between STI-derived phase contrast induced by the susceptibility
tensor terms (ki13,ki23,ki33) and the acquired single-orientation phase. The
convolution neural networks are embedded into the physical model to learn a
regularization term containing prior information. ki33 and phase induced by
ki13 and ki23 terms were used as the labels for network training. Quantitative
evaluation metrics (RSME, SSIM, and HFEN) were compared with recently developed
deep learning QSM methods. The results showed that MoDL-QSM achieved superior

number $x\in[0,1]$ using a single bit. A sender that knows $x$ chooses a value
$X\in\set{0,1}$ to transmit. In turn, a receiver estimates $x$ based on the
value of $X$. We consider both the biased and unbiased estimation problems and
aim to minimize the cost. For the biased case, the cost is the worst-case (over
the choice of $x$) expected squared error, which coincides with the variance if
the algorithm is required to be unbiased.

We first overview common biased and unbiased estimation approaches and prove
their optimality when no shared randomness is allowed. We then show how a small
amount of shared randomness, which can be as low as a single bit, reduces the
cost in both cases. Specifically, we derive lower bounds on the cost attainable
by any algorithm with unrestricted use of shared randomness and propose
near-optimal solutions that use a small number of shared random bits. Finally,
we discuss open problems and future directions.]]></summary>

reachability estimations across all the nodes are maximized. We show that this

risk. While considerable efforts have been made in this direction, a
long-standing challenge is how to effectively exploit internal user information
and provide explainable prediction results. In fact, the value variations of
same field from different events and the interactions of different fields
inside one event have proven to be strong indicators for fraudulent behaviors.
In this paper, we propose the Dual Importance-aware Factorization Machines
(DIFM), which exploits the internal field information among users' behavior
sequence from dual perspectives, i.e., field value variations and field
interactions simultaneously for fraud detection. The proposed model is deployed
in the risk management system of one of the world's largest e-commerce
platforms, which utilize it to provide real-time transaction fraud detection.
Experimental results on real industrial data from different regions in the
platform clearly demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements
compared with various state-of-the-art baseline models. Moreover, the DIFM
could also give an insight into the explanation of the prediction results from
dual perspectives.]]></summary>

beginning to influence computer vision architectures. Training very large
transformer models allowed significant improvement in both fields, but once
trained, these networks show symptoms of over-parameterization. For instance,
it is known that many attention heads can be pruned without impacting accuracy.
This work aims to enhance current understanding on how multiple heads interact.
Motivated by the observation that attention heads learn redundant key/query
projections, we propose a collaborative multi-head attention layer that enables
heads to learn shared projections. Our scheme decreases the number of
parameters in an attention layer and can be used as a drop-in replacement in
any transformer architecture. Our experiments confirm that sharing key/query
dimensions can be exploited in language understanding, machine translation and
vision. We also show that it is possible to re-parametrize a pre-trained
multi-head attention layer into our collaborative attention layer.
Collaborative multi-head attention reduces the size of the key and query
projections by 4 for same accuracy and speed. Our code is public.]]></summary>

and academia, especially for computer vision tasks. The great success of deep
learning is mainly due to its scalability to encode large-scale data and to
maneuver billions of model parameters. However, it is a challenge to deploy
these cumbersome deep models on devices with limited resources, e.g., mobile
phones and embedded devices, not only because of the high computational
complexity but also the large storage requirements. To this end, a variety of
model compression and acceleration techniques have been developed. As a
representative type of model compression and acceleration, knowledge
distillation effectively learns a small student model from a large teacher
model. It has received rapid increasing attention from the community. This
paper provides a comprehensive survey of knowledge distillation from the
perspectives of knowledge categories, training schemes, teacher-student
architecture, distillation algorithms, performance comparison and applications.
Furthermore, challenges in knowledge distillation are briefly reviewed and
comments on future research are discussed and forwarded.]]></summary>

neurons integrate inputs as an analog sum but communicate with spikes, binary
events in time. Analog neuromorphic hardware uses the same principles to
emulate spiking neural networks with exceptional energy-efficiency. However,
instantiating high-performing spiking networks on such hardware remains a
significant challenge due to device mismatch and the lack of efficient training
algorithms. Here, we introduce a general in-the-loop learning framework based
on surrogate gradients that resolves these issues. Using the BrainScaleS-2
neuromorphic system, we show that learning self-corrects for device mismatch
resulting in competitive spiking network performance on both vision and speech
benchmarks. Our networks display sparse spiking activity with, on average, far
less than one spike per hidden neuron and input, perform inference at rates of
up to 85 k frames/second, and consume less than 200 mW. In summary, our work
sets several new benchmarks for low-energy spiking network processing on analog

distribution from i.i.d. samples of the distribution using model classes of
functions in tree-based tensor formats, a particular case of tensor networks
associated with a dimension partition tree. The distribution is assumed to
admit a density with respect to a product measure, possibly discrete for
handling the case of discrete random variables.

After discussing the representation of classical model classes in tree-based
tensor formats, we present learning algorithms based on empirical risk
minimization using a $L^2$ contrast.

These algorithms exploit the multilinear parametrization of the formats to
recast the nonlinear minimization problem into a sequence of empirical risk
minimization problems with linear models. A suitable parametrization of the
tensor in tree-based tensor format allows to obtain a linear model with
orthogonal bases, so that each problem admits an explicit expression of the
solution and cross-validation risk estimates. These estimations of the risk
enable the model selection, for instance when exploiting sparsity in the
coefficients of the representation.

A strategy for the adaptation of the tensor format (dimension tree and
tree-based ranks) is provided, which allows to discover and exploit some
specific structures of high-dimensional probability distributions such as
independence or conditional independence.

We illustrate the performances of the proposed algorithms for the
approximation of classical probabilistic models (such as Gaussian distribution,
graphical models, Markov chain).]]></summary>

pre-trained NN (LeCun et al.,1990; Hassibi et al., 1993), recent work by Lee et

for Deep NNs, such procedures remain unsatisfactory as the resulting pruned
networks can be difficult to train and, for instance, they do not prevent one

attention recently. In this scenario, user's behavior evolves from single click
behavior to multiple behaviors including like, comment, share etc. However,
most of the existing methods still use single click behavior as the unique
criterion of judging user's preferences. Further, although heterogeneous graphs
have been applied in different areas, a proper way to construct a heterogeneous
graph for interactive news data with an appropriate learning mechanism on it is
still desired. To address the above concerns, we propose a graph-based
behavior-aware network, which simultaneously considers six different types of
behaviors as well as user's demand on the news diversity. We have three main
steps. First, we build an interaction behavior graph for multi-level and
multi-category data. Second, we apply DeepWalk on the behavior graph to obtain
entity semantics, then build a graph-based convolutional neural network called
G-CNN to learn news representations, and an attention-based LSTM to learn
behavior sequence representations. Third, we introduce core and coritivity
features for the behavior graph, which measure the concentration degree of
user's interests. These features affect the trade-off between accuracy and
diversity of our personalized recommendation system. Taking these features into
account, our system finally achieves recommending news to different users at
their different levels of concentration degrees.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a prevailing trend to study urban morphology quantitatively thanks
to the growing accessibility to various forms of spatial big data, increasing
computing power, and use cases benefiting from such information. The methods
developed up to now measure urban morphology with numerical indices describing
density, proportion, and mixture, but they do not directly represent
morphological features from human's visual and intuitive perspective. We take
the first step to bridge the gap by proposing a deep learning-based technique
to automatically classify road networks into four classes on a visual basis.
The method is implemented by generating an image of the street network (Colored
Road Hierarchy Diagram), which we introduce in this paper, and classifying it
using a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-34). The model achieves an
overall classification accuracy of 0.875. Nine cities around the world are
selected as the study areas and their road networks are acquired from
OpenStreetMap. Latent subgroups among the cities are uncovered through a
clustering on the percentage of each road network category. In the subsequent
part of the paper, we focus on the usability of such classification: the
effectiveness of our human perception augmentation is examined by a case study
of urban vitality prediction. An advanced tree-based regression model is for
the first time designated to establish the relationship between morphological
indices and vitality indicators. A positive effect of human perception
augmentation is detected in the comparative experiment of baseline model and
augmented model. This work expands the toolkit of quantitative urban morphology
study with new techniques, supporting further studies in the future.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-view classification is inspired by the behavior of humans, especially
when fine-grained features or in our case rarely occurring anomalies are to be
detected. Current contributions point to the problem of how high-dimensional
data can be fused. In this work, we build upon the deep support vector data
description algorithm and address multi-perspective anomaly detection using
three different fusion techniques i.e. early fusion, late fusion, and late
fusion with multiple decoders. We employ different augmentation techniques with
a denoising process to deal with scarce one-class data, which further improves
the performance (ROC AUC = 80\%). Furthermore, we introduce the dices dataset
that consists of over 2000 grayscale images of falling dices from multiple
perspectives, with 5\% of the images containing rare anomalies (e.g. drill
holes, sawing, or scratches). We evaluate our approach on the new dices dataset
using images from two different perspectives and also benchmark on the standard
MNIST dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach
exceeds the state-of-the-art on both the MNIST and dices datasets. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on addressing
multi-perspective anomaly detection in images by jointly using different
perspectives together with one single objective function for anomaly detection.]]></summary>

conversion (VC) framework based on cyclic variational autoencoder (CycleVAE)
and multiband WaveRNN with data-driven linear prediction (MWDLP). CycleVAE is a
robust non-parallel multispeaker spectral model, which utilizes a
speaker-independent latent space and a speaker-dependent code to generate
reconstructed/converted spectral features given the spectral features of an
input speaker. On the other hand, MWDLP is an efficient and a high-quality
neural vocoder that can handle multispeaker data and generate speech waveform
for LLRT applications with CPU. To accommodate LLRT constraint with CPU, we
propose a novel CycleVAE framework that utilizes mel-spectrogram as spectral
features and is built with a sparse network architecture. Further, to improve
the modeling performance, we also propose a novel fine-tuning procedure that
refines the frame-rate CycleVAE network by utilizing the waveform loss from the
MWDLP network. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework
achieves high-performance VC, while allowing for LLRT usage with a single-core

society since a growing number of users use them for information seeking and
decision making. Therefore, it is crucial to address the potential unfairness
problems in recommendations. Just like users have personalized preferences on
items, users' demands for fairness are also personalized in many scenarios.
Therefore, it is important to provide personalized fair recommendations for
users to satisfy their personalized fairness demands. Besides, previous works
on fair recommendation mainly focus on association-based fairness. However, it
is important to advance from associative fairness notions to causal fairness
notions for assessing fairness more properly in recommender systems. Based on
the above considerations, this paper focuses on achieving personalized
counterfactual fairness for users in recommender systems. To this end, we
introduce a framework for achieving counterfactually fair recommendations
through adversary learning by generating feature-independent user embeddings
for recommendation. The framework allows recommender systems to achieve
personalized fairness for users while also covering non-personalized
situations. Experiments on two real-world datasets with shallow and deep
recommendation algorithms show that our method can generate fairer
recommendations for users with a desirable recommendation performance.]]></summary>

and symmetries can be done by deep learning. The constraints can be either
imposed as terms in a loss function or used to formulate a neural ansatz. In
the present case study, we calculate the induced field inside and outside a
dielectric cube placed in a uniform electric field, wherein the dielectric
mismatch at edges and corners of the cube makes accurate calculations
numerically challenging. The electric potential is expressed as an ansatz
incorporating neural networks with known leading order behaviors and symmetries
and the Laplace's equation is then solved with boundary conditions at the
dielectric interface by minimizing a loss function. The loss function ensures
that both Laplace's equation and boundary conditions are satisfied everywhere
inside a large solution domain. We study how the electric potential inside and
outside a quasi-cubic particle evolves through a sequence of shapes from a
sphere to a cube. The neural network being differentiable, it is
straightforward to calculate the electric field over the whole domain, the
induced surface charge distribution and the polarizability. The neural network
being retentive, one can efficiently follow how the field changes upon
particle's shape or dielectric constant by iterating from any previously
converged solution. The present work's objective is two-fold, first to show how
an a priori knowledge can be incorporated into neural networks to achieve
efficient learning and second to apply the method and study how the induced

to its rapid spreading nature through respiratory transmission. As a result,
there is a huge demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based quick disease
diagnosis methods as an alternative to high demand tests such as Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR). Chest X-ray (CXR) Image analysis is such cost-effective
radiography technique due to resource availability and quick screening. But, a
sufficient and systematic data collection that is required by complex deep
leaning (DL) models is more difficult and hence there are recent efforts that
utilize transfer learning to address this issue. Still these transfer learnt
models suffer from lack of generalization and increased bias to the training
dataset resulting poor performance for unseen data. Limited correlation of the
transferred features from the pre-trained model to a specific medical imaging
domain like X-ray and overfitting on fewer data can be reasons for this
circumstance. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Convolution Neural Network
(GCN) that is capable of identifying bio-markers of Covid-19 pneumonia from CXR
images and meta information about patients. The proposed method exploits
important relational knowledge between data instances and their features using
graph representation and applies convolution to learn the graph data which is
not possible with conventional convolution on Euclidean domain. The results of
extensive experiments of proposed model on binary (Covid vs normal) and three
class (Covid, normal, other pneumonia) classification problems outperform
different benchmark transfer learnt models, hence overcoming the aforementioned
drawbacks.]]></summary>

tackles two commonly encountered problems in biomedical imaging: Topological
consistency of the segmentation, and limited annotations. We propose a
topological score which measures both topological and geometric consistency
between the predicted and ground truth segmentations, applied for model
selection and validation. We apply our topological score in three scenarios: i.
a U-net ii. a U-net pretrained on an autoencoder, and iii. a semisupervised
U-net architecture, which offers a straightforward approach to jointly training
the network both as an autoencoder and a segmentation algorithm. This allows us
to utilize un-annotated data for training a representation that generalizes
across test data variability, in spite of our annotated training data having
very limited variation. Our contributions are validated on a challenging

alternative to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This is because it is resistant to
the over-smoothing problem, and deeper GA-MLP models yield better performance.
GA-MLP models are traditionally optimized by the Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD). However, SGD suffers from the layer dependency problem, which prevents
the gradients of different layers of GA-MLP models from being calculated in
parallel. In this paper, we propose a parallel deep learning Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (pdADMM) framework to achieve model
parallelism: parameters in each layer of GA-MLP models can be updated in
parallel. The extended pdADMM-Q algorithm reduces communication cost by
utilizing the quantization technique. Theoretical convergence to a critical
point of the pdADMM algorithm and the pdADMM-Q algorithm is provided with a
sublinear convergence rate $o(1/k)$. Extensive experiments in six benchmark
datasets demonstrate that the pdADMM can lead to high speedup, and outperforms
all the existing state-of-the-art comparison methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The absence or abnormality of fidgety movements of joints or limbs is
strongly indicative of cerebral palsy in infants. Developing computer-based
methods for assessing infant movements in videos is pivotal for improved
cerebral palsy screening. Most existing methods use appearance-based features
and are thus sensitive to strong but irrelevant signals caused by background
clutter or a moving camera. Moreover, these features are computed over the
whole frame, thus they measure gross whole body movements rather than specific
joint/limb motion.

Addressing these challenges, we develop and validate a new method for fidgety
movement assessment from consumer-grade videos using human poses extracted from
short clips. Human poses capture only relevant motion profiles of joints and
limbs and are thus free from irrelevant appearance artifacts. The dynamics and
coordination between joints are modeled using spatio-temporal graph
convolutional networks. Frames and body parts that contain discriminative
information about fidgety movements are selected through a spatio-temporal
attention mechanism. We validate the proposed model on the cerebral palsy
screening task using a real-life consumer-grade video dataset collected at an
Australian hospital through the Cerebral Palsy Alliance, Australia. Our
experiments show that the proposed method achieves the ROC-AUC score of 81.87%,
significantly outperforming existing competing methods with better
interpretability.]]></summary>

the quality of life for the occupant via a variety of sensors and actuators
installed throughout the space. Many automated actions taken by a smart home
are governed by the output of an underlying activity recognition system.
However, activity recognition systems may not be perfectly accurate and
therefore inconsistencies in smart home operations can lead a user to wonder
"why did the smart home do that?" In this work, we build on insights from
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to contribute
computational methods for explainable activity recognition. Specifically, we
generate explanations for smart home activity recognition systems that explain
what about an activity led to the given classification. To do so, we introduce
four computational techniques for generating natural language explanations of
smart home data and compare their effectiveness at generating meaningful
explanations. Through a study with everyday users, we evaluate user preferences
towards the four explanation types. Our results show that the leading approach,
SHAP, has a 92% success rate in generating accurate explanations. Moreover, 84%
of sampled scenarios users preferred natural language explanations over a
simple activity label, underscoring the need for explainable activity
recognition systems. Finally, we show that explanations generated by some XAI
methods can lead users to lose confidence in the accuracy of the underlying
activity recognition model, while others lead users to gain confidence. Taking
all studied factors into consideration, we make a recommendation regarding
which existing XAI method leads to the best performance in the domain of smart
home automation, and discuss a range of topics for future work in this area.]]></summary>

proposed when searching for the optimal tuning parameter, which not only speeds

Vision APIs as they offer multiple services including pre-built models and
algorithms, which otherwise take a huge amount of resources if built from
scratch. As these APIs get deployed for high-stakes applications, it's very
important that they are robust to different manipulations. Recent works have
only focused on typical adversarial attacks when evaluating the robustness of
vision APIs. We propose two new aspects of adversarial image generation methods
and evaluate them on the robustness of Google Cloud Vision API's optical
character recognition service and object detection APIs deployed in real-world
settings such as sightengine.com, picpurify.com, Google Cloud Vision API, and
Microsoft Azure's Computer Vision API. Specifically, we go beyond the
conventional small-noise adversarial attacks and introduce secret embedding and
transparent adversarial examples as a simpler way to evaluate robustness. These
methods are so straightforward that even non-specialists can craft such
attacks. As a result, they pose a serious threat where APIs are used for
high-stakes applications. Our transparent adversarial examples successfully
evade state-of-the art object detections APIs such as Azure Cloud Vision
(attack success rate 52%) and Google Cloud Vision (attack success rate 36%).
90% of the images have a secret embedded text that successfully fools the
vision of time-limited humans but is detected by Google Cloud Vision API's
optical character recognition. Complementing to current research, our results
provide simple but unconventional methods on robustness evaluation.]]></summary>

reinforcement learning. The number of the constraints depends on the size of
state and action spaces, which makes the problem intractable in large or
continuous environments. The general augmented Lagrangian method suffers the
double-sampling obstacle in solving the LP. Namely, the conditional
expectations originated from the constraint functions and the quadratic
penalties in the augmented Lagrangian function impose difficulties in sampling
and evaluation. Motivated from the updates of the multipliers, we overcome the
obstacles in minimizing the augmented Lagrangian function by replacing the
intractable conditional expectations with the multipliers. Therefore, a deep
parameterized augment Lagrangian method is proposed. Furthermore, the
replacement provides a promising breakthrough to integrate the two steps in the
augmented Lagrangian method into a single constrained problem. A general
theoretical analysis shows that the solutions generated from a sequence of the
constrained optimizations converge to the optimal solution of the LP if the
error is controlled properly. A theoretical analysis on the quadratic penalty
algorithm under neural tangent kernel setting shows the residual can be
arbitrarily small if the parameter in network and optimization algorithm is
chosen suitably. Preliminary experiments illustrate that our method is
competitive to other state-of-the-art algorithms.]]></summary>

applications, including surgical automation and visual feedback. In this study
we investigate localization and autonomous robotic control of needles in the
context of our magneto-suturing system. Our system holds the potential for
surgical manipulation with the benefit of minimal invasiveness and reduced
patient side effects. However, the non-linear magnetic fields produce
unintuitive forces and demand delicate position-based control that exceeds the
capabilities of direct human manipulation. This makes automatic needle
localization a necessity. Our localization method combines neural network-based
segmentation and classical techniques, and we are able to consistently locate
our needle with 0.73 mm RMS error in clean environments and 2.72 mm RMS error
in challenging environments with blood and occlusion. The average localization
RMS error is 2.16 mm for all environments we used in the experiments. We
combine this localization method with our closed-loop feedback control system
to demonstrate the further applicability of localization to autonomous control.
Our needle is able to follow a running suture path in (1) no blood, no tissue;
(2) heavy blood, no tissue; (3) no blood, with tissue; and (4) heavy blood,
with tissue environments. The tip position tracking error ranges from 2.6 mm to

attention in the past few years as it can utilize large-scale auto-labeled
data. However, its evaluation has long been a problem: previous works either
took costly and inconsistent methods to manually examine a small sample of
model predictions, or directly test models on auto-labeled data -- which, by
our check, produce as much as 53% wrong labels at the entity pair level in the
popular NYT10 dataset. This problem has not only led to inaccurate evaluation,
but also made it hard to understand where we are and what's left to improve in
the research of DS-RE. To evaluate DS-RE models in a more credible way, we
build manually-annotated test sets for two DS-RE datasets, NYT10 and Wiki20,
and thoroughly evaluate several competitive models, especially the latest
pre-trained ones. The experimental results show that the manual evaluation can
indicate very different conclusions from automatic ones, especially some
unexpected observations, e.g., pre-trained models can achieve dominating
performance while being more susceptible to false-positives compared to

biological neural networks. Various methods have been proposed for ensemble
inference from experimental data of neuronal activity. Among them, Bayesian

work, we give an improved Bayesian inference algorithm by modifying update rule

dependencies between variables of a joint probability distribution. A
fundamental task in data science is to learn a Bayesian network from observed

network that fulfills the additional property that its underlying undirected
graph is a forest. In this work, we revisit the complexity of \textsc{Polytree

the total instance size. Moreover, we consider the influence of the number of
variables $d$ that might receive a nonempty parent set in the final DAG on the
complexity of \textsc{Polytree Learning}. We show that \textsc{Polytree
Learning} has no $f(d)\cdot |I|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$-time algorithm, unlike
Bayesian network learning which can be solved in $2^d \cdot

of coronary heart disease (CHD) at an earlier stage can greatly reduce the
mortality rate. We use 64 two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography
(2D-STE) features and seven clinical features to predict whether one has CHD.
Methods: We develop a machine learning approach that integrates a number of
popular classification methods together by model stacking, and generalize the
traditional stacking method to a two-step stacking method to improve the
diagnostic performance. Results: By borrowing strengths from multiple
classification models through the proposed method, we improve the CHD
classification accuracy from around 70% to 87.7% on the testing set. The
sensitivity of the proposed method is 0.903 and the specificity is 0.843, with
an AUC of 0.904, which is significantly higher than those of the individual
classification models. Conclusions: Our work lays a foundation for the
deployment of speckle tracking echocardiography-based screening tools for

clinical results, images, and textual descriptions of patient's health state.
All these data can be analyzed and employed to cater novel services that can
help people and domain experts with their common healthcare tasks. However,
many technologies such as Deep Learning and tools like Word Embeddings have
started to be investigated only recently, and many challenges remain open when
it comes to healthcare domain applications. To address these challenges, we
propose the use of Deep Learning and Word Embeddings for identifying sixteen
morbidity types within textual descriptions of clinical records. For this
purpose, we have used a Deep Learning model based on Bidirectional Long-Short
Term Memory (LSTM) layers which can exploit state-of-the-art vector
representations of data such as Word Embeddings. We have employed pre-trained
Word Embeddings namely GloVe and Word2Vec, and our own Word Embeddings trained
on the target domain. Furthermore, we have compared the performances of the
deep learning approaches against the traditional tf-idf using Support Vector
Machine and Multilayer perceptron (our baselines). From the obtained results it
seems that the latter outperforms the combination of Deep Learning approaches
using any word embeddings. Our preliminary results indicate that there are
specific features that make the dataset biased in favour of traditional machine
learning approaches.]]></summary>

processes with history dependence. Here we propose an extended model where the
self--effects are of both excitatory and inhibitory type and follow a Gaussian
Process. Whereas previous work either relies on a less flexible
parameterization of the model, or requires a large amount of data, our
formulation allows for both a flexible model and learning when data are scarce.
We continue the line of work of Bayesian inference for Hawkes processes, and
our approach dispenses with the necessity of estimating a branching structure
for the posterior, as we perform inference on an aggregated sum of Gaussian
Processes. Efficient approximate Bayesian inference is achieved via data
augmentation, and we describe a mean--field variational inference approach to
learn the model parameters. To demonstrate the flexibility of the model we
apply our methodology on data from three different domains and compare it to
previously reported results.]]></summary>

six classification models to shed light on the types of architectures best

started drawing attention due to its ability to accumulate information from
different source modalities and generate a fluent textual summary. However,
existing methods use short videos as the visual modality and short summary as
the ground-truth, therefore, perform poorly on lengthy videos and long
ground-truth summary. Additionally, there exists no benchmark dataset to
generalize this task on videos of varying lengths. In this paper, we introduce
AVIATE, the first large-scale dataset for abstractive text summarization with
videos of diverse duration, compiled from presentations in well-known academic
conferences like NDSS, ICML, NeurIPS, etc. We use the abstract of corresponding
research papers as the reference summaries, which ensure adequate quality and
uniformity of the ground-truth. We then propose {\name}, a factorized
multi-modal Transformer based decoder-only language model, which inherently
captures the intra-modal and inter-modal dynamics within various input
modalities for the text summarization task. {\name} utilizes an increasing
number of self-attentions to capture multimodality and performs significantly
better than traditional encoder-decoder based networks. Extensive experiments
illustrate that {\name} achieves significant improvement over the baselines in
both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the existing How2 dataset for
short videos and newly introduced AVIATE dataset for videos with diverse

of symbolic representations, the family of symbolic aggregate approximations
(SAX) has been used extensively for encoding time series data. However, typical
SAX-based methods rely on two restrictive assumptions; the Gaussian
distribution and equiprobable symbols. This paper proposes two novel
data-driven SAX-based symbolic representations, distinguished by their
discretization steps. The first representation, oriented for general data
compaction and indexing scenarios, is based on the combination of kernel
density estimation and Lloyd-Max quantization to minimize the information loss
and mean squared error in the discretization step. The second method, oriented
for high-level mining tasks, employs the Mean-Shift clustering method and is
shown to enhance anomaly detection in the lower-dimensional space. Besides, we
verify on a theoretical basis a previously observed phenomenon of the intrinsic
process that results in a lower than the expected variance of the intermediate
piecewise aggregate approximation. This phenomenon causes an additional
information loss but can be avoided with a simple modification. The proposed
representations possess all the attractive properties of the conventional SAX
method. Furthermore, experimental evaluation on real-world datasets
demonstrates their superiority compared to the traditional SAX and an

of a new field of studying privacy-preserving machine learning from isolated
data sources, i.e., \textit{federated learning}. Vertical federated learning,
where different parties hold different features for common users, has a great
potential of driving a more variety of business cooperation among enterprises
in different fields. Decision tree models especially decision tree ensembles
are a class of widely applied powerful machine learning models with high
interpretability and modeling efficiency. However, the interpretability are
compromised in these works such as SecureBoost since the feature names are not
exposed to avoid possible data breaches due to the unprotected decision path.
In this paper, we shall propose Fed-EINI, an efficient and interpretable
inference framework for federated decision tree models with only one round of
multi-party communication. We shall compute the candidate sets of leaf nodes
based on the local data at each party in parallel, followed by securely
computing the weight of the only leaf node in the intersection of the candidate
sets. We propose to protect the decision path by the efficient additively
homomorphic encryption method, which allows the disclosure of feature names and
thus makes the federated decision trees interpretable. The advantages of
Fed-EINI will be demonstrated through theoretical analysis and extensive
numerical results. Experiments show that the inference efficiency is improved
by over $50\%$ in average.]]></summary>

quantum algorithms. Although quantum neural networks (QNNs) have shown
promising results in solving simple machine learning tasks recently, for the
time being, the effect of entanglement in QNNs and the behavior of QNNs in
binary pattern classification are still underexplored. In this work, we provide
some theoretical insight into the properties of QNNs by presenting and
analyzing a new form of invariance embedded in QNNs for both quantum binary
classification and quantum representation learning, which we term negational
symmetry. Given a quantum binary signal and its negational counterpart where a
bitwise NOT operation is applied to each quantum bit of the binary signal, a
QNN outputs the same logits. That is to say, QNNs cannot differentiate a
quantum binary signal and its negational counterpart in a binary classification
task. We further empirically evaluate the negational symmetry of QNNs in binary
pattern classification tasks using Google's quantum computing framework. The
theoretical and experimental results suggest that negational symmetry is a
fundamental property of QNNs, which is not shared by classical models. Our
findings also imply that negational symmetry is a double-edged sword in
practical quantum applications.]]></summary>

performing a non-uniform transformation of the time variable. In the SDE, the
gradient of the loss is replaced by that of the logarithmized loss.
Consequently, we show that, near a local or global minimum, the stationary
distribution $P_\mathrm{ss}(\theta)$ of the network parameters $\theta$ follows
a power-law with respect to the loss function $L(\theta)$, i.e.
$P_\mathrm{ss}(\theta)\propto L(\theta)^{-\phi}$ with the exponent $\phi$
specified by the mini-batch size, the learning rate, and the Hessian at the
minimum. We obtain the escape rate formula from a local minimum, which is
determined not by the loss barrier height $\Delta L=L(\theta^s)-L(\theta^*)$
between a minimum $\theta^*$ and a saddle $\theta^s$ but by the logarithmized
loss barrier height $\Delta\log L=\log[L(\theta^s)/L(\theta^*)]$. Our
escape-rate formula explains an empirical fact that SGD prefers flat minima
with low effective dimensions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We propose a new type of neural networks, Kronecker neural networks (KNNs),
that form a general framework for neural networks with adaptive activation
functions. KNNs employ the Kronecker product, which provides an efficient way
of constructing a very wide network while keeping the number of parameters low.
Our theoretical analysis reveals that under suitable conditions, KNNs induce a
faster decay of the loss than that by the feed-forward networks. This is also
empirically verified through a set of computational examples. Furthermore,
under certain technical assumptions, we establish global convergence of
gradient descent for KNNs. As a specific case, we propose the Rowdy activation
function that is designed to get rid of any saturation region by injecting
sinusoidal fluctuations, which include trainable parameters. The proposed Rowdy
activation function can be employed in any neural network architecture like
feed-forward neural networks, Recurrent neural networks, Convolutional neural
networks etc. The effectiveness of KNNs with Rowdy activation is demonstrated
through various computational experiments including function approximation
using feed-forward neural networks, solution inference of partial differential
equations using the physics-informed neural networks, and standard deep
learning benchmark problems using convolutional and fully-connected neural
networks.]]></summary>

within the realm of data mining and science discovery over the past few years.
This problem remains an attempt to identify future, deleted, and redundant
links using the existing links in a graph. Local random walk is considered to
be one of the most well-known algorithms in the category of quasi-local
methods. It traverses the network using the traditional random walk with a
limited number of steps, randomly selecting one adjacent node in each step
among the nodes which have equal importance. Then this method uses the
transition probability between node pairs to calculate the similarity between
them. However, in most datasets, this method is not able to perform accurately
in scoring remarkably similar nodes. In the present article, an efficient
method is proposed for improving local random walk by encouraging random walk
to move, in every step, towards the node which has a stronger influence.
Therefore, the next node is selected according to the influence of the source
node. To do so, using mutual information, the concept of the asymmetric mutual
influence of nodes is presented. A comparison between the proposed method and
other similarity-based methods (local, quasi-local, and global) has been
performed, and results have been reported for 11 real-world networks. It had a
higher prediction accuracy compared with other link prediction approaches.]]></summary>

mCOLT is empowered by two techniques: (i) a contrastive learning scheme to
close the gap among representations of different languages, and (ii) data
augmentation on both multiple parallel and monolingual data to further align
token representations. For English-centric directions, mCOLT achieves
competitive or even better performance than a strong pre-trained model mBART on

investment decisions and when patient safety is paramount, but machine learning
(ML) models in drug discovery typically provide only a single best estimate and
ignore all sources of uncertainty. Predictions from these models may therefore
be over-confident, which can put patients at risk and waste resources when
compounds that are destined to fail are further developed. Probabilistic
predictive models (PPMs) can incorporate uncertainty in both the data and
model, and return a distribution of predicted values that represents the
uncertainty in the prediction. PPMs not only let users know when predictions
are uncertain, but the intuitive output from these models makes communicating
risk easier and decision making better. Many popular machine learning methods
have a PPM or Bayesian analogue, making PPMs easy to fit into current
workflows. We use toxicity prediction as a running example, but the same
principles apply for all prediction models used in drug discovery. The
consequences of ignoring uncertainty and how PPMs account for uncertainty are
also described. We aim to make the discussion accessible to a broad
non-mathematical audience. Equations are provided to make ideas concrete for
mathematical readers (but can be skipped without loss of understanding) and

developed for solving multiphase flow in 3D heterogeneous porous media. The
model fully leverages the spatial topology predictive capability of
convolutional neural networks, and is coupled with an efficient
continuity-based smoother to predict flow responses that need spatial
continuity. Furthermore, the transient regions are penalized to steer the
training process such that the model can accurately capture flow in these
regions. The model takes inputs including properties of porous media, fluid
properties and well controls, and predicts the temporal-spatial evolution of
the state variables (pressure and saturation). While maintaining the continuity
of fluid flow, the 3D spatial domain is decomposed into 2D images for reducing
training cost, and the decomposition results in an increased number of training
data samples and better training efficiency. Additionally, a surrogate model is
separately constructed as a postprocessor to calculate well flow rate based on
the predictions of state variables from the deep learning model. We use the
example of CO2 injection into saline aquifers, and apply the
physics-constrained deep learning model that is trained from physics-based
simulation data and emulates the physics process. The model performs prediction
with a speedup of ~1400 times compared to physics-based simulations, and the
average temporal errors of predicted pressure and saturation plumes are 0.27%
and 0.099% respectively. Furthermore, water production rate is efficiently
predicted by a surrogate model for well flow rate, with a mean error less than
5%. Therefore, with its unique scheme to cope with the fidelity in fluid flow
in porous media, the physics-constrained deep learning model can become an
efficient predictive model for computationally demanding inverse problems or
other coupled processes.]]></summary>

and carbon dioxide (CO2) plume migration under geologic uncertainties is a
challenging problem in geologic carbon storage. The high computational cost of

leverage physical understandings of porous medium flow behavior with deep
learning techniques to develop a fast history matching-reservoir response
forecasting workflow. Applying an Ensemble Smoother Multiple Data Assimilation
framework, the workflow updates geologic properties and predicts reservoir
performance with quantified uncertainty from pressure history and CO2 plumes
interpreted through seismic inversion. As the most computationally expensive

models to predict dynamic pressure and CO2 plume extents under multi-well

specifically, a wide residual network and a residual U-Net. The workflow is
validated against a flat three-dimensional reservoir model representative of a

without quick medical intervention would lower the chances of survival for the
elderly, especially if living alone. Hence, the need is there for developing
fall detection algorithms with high accuracy. This paper presents a novel
IoT-based system for fall detection that includes a sensing device transmitting
data to a mobile application through a cloud-connected gateway device. Then,
the focus is shifted to the algorithmic aspect where multiple features are
extracted from 3-axis accelerometer data taken from existing datasets. The
results emphasize on the significance of Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) as
an influential feature for determining falls. CWT, Signal Energy (SE), Signal
Magnitude Area (SMA), and Signal Vector Magnitude (SVM) features have shown
promising classification results using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and E-Nearest
Neighbors (ENN). For all performance metrics (accuracy, recall, precision,
specificity, and F1 Score), the achieved results are higher than 95% for a
dataset of small size, while more than 98.47% score is achieved in the
aforementioned criteria over the UniMiB-SHAR dataset by the same algorithms,
where the classification time for a single test record is extremely efficient

interest. Yet, almost all of them generate discrete shape representations, such
as voxels, point clouds, and polygon meshes. We present the first 3D generative
model for a drastically different shape representation -- describing a shape as
a sequence of computer-aided design (CAD) operations. Unlike meshes and point
clouds, CAD models encode the user creation process of 3D shapes, widely used
in numerous industrial and engineering design tasks. However, the sequential
and irregular structure of CAD operations poses significant challenges for
existing 3D generative models. Drawing an analogy between CAD operations and
natural language, we propose a CAD generative network based on the Transformer.
We demonstrate the performance of our model for both shape autoencoding and
random shape generation. To train our network, we create a new CAD dataset
consisting of 179,133 models and their CAD construction sequences. We have made
this dataset publicly available to promote future research on this topic.]]></summary>

carrying much more information than raw pixels. There is an inherent relational
structure to the relationship among different superpixels of an image. This
relational information can convey some form of domain information about the
image, e.g. relationship between superpixels representing two eyes in a cat
image. Our interest in this paper is to construct computer vision models,
specifically those based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to incorporate these
superpixels information. We propose a methodology to construct a hybrid model
that leverages (a) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to deal with spatial
information in an image, and (b) Graph Neural Network (GNN) to deal with
relational superpixel information in the image. The proposed deep model is
learned using a generic hybrid loss function that we call a `hybrid' loss. We
evaluate the predictive performance of our proposed hybrid vision model on four
popular image classification datasets: MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
Moreover, we evaluate our method on three real-world classification tasks:
COVID-19 X-Ray Detection, LFW Face Recognition, and SOCOFing Fingerprint
Identification. The results demonstrate that the relational superpixel
information provided via a GNN could improve the performance of standard
CNN-based vision systems.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Non-stationary environments are challenging for reinforcement learning
algorithms. If the state transition and/or reward functions change based on
latent factors, the agent is effectively tasked with optimizing a behavior that
maximizes performance over a possibly infinite random sequence of Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs), each of which drawn from some unknown distribution.
We call each such MDP a context. Most related works make strong assumptions
such as knowledge about the distribution over contexts, the existence of
pre-training phases, or a priori knowledge about the number, sequence, or
boundaries between contexts. We introduce an algorithm that efficiently learns
policies in non-stationary environments. It analyzes a possibly infinite stream
of data and computes, in real-time, high-confidence change-point detection
statistics that reflect whether novel, specialized policies need to be created
and deployed to tackle novel contexts, or whether previously-optimized ones
might be reused. We show that (i) this algorithm minimizes the delay until
unforeseen changes to a context are detected, thereby allowing for rapid
responses; and (ii) it bounds the rate of false alarm, which is important in
order to minimize regret. Our method constructs a mixture model composed of a
(possibly infinite) ensemble of probabilistic dynamics predictors that model
the different modes of the distribution over underlying latent MDPs. We
evaluate our algorithm on high-dimensional continuous reinforcement learning
problems and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art (model-free and
model-based) RL algorithms, as well as state-of-the-art meta-learning methods
specially designed to deal with non-stationarity.]]></summary>

multitude of sophisticated models and algorithms designed for various mining
tasks, such as ranking, classification, clustering and anomaly detection.
Generally speaking, the vast majority of the existing works aim to answer the
following question, that is, given a graph, what is the best way to mine it? In
this paper, we introduce the graph sanitation problem, to answer an orthogonal
question. That is, given a mining task and an initial graph, what is the best
way to improve the initially provided graph? By learning a better graph as part
of the input of the mining model, it is expected to benefit graph mining in a
variety of settings, ranging from denoising, imputation to defense. We
formulate the graph sanitation problem as a bilevel optimization problem, and
further instantiate it by semi-supervised node classification, together with an
effective solver named GaSoliNe. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method is (1) broadly applicable with respect to different
graph neural network models and flexible graph modification strategies, (2)
effective in improving the node classification accuracy on both the original
and contaminated graphs in various perturbation scenarios. In particular, it
brings up to 25% performance improvement over the existing robust graph neural
network methods.]]></summary>

to avoid obstacles, especially with developments in tires, suspensions,
steering, as well as safety technologies like ABS, ESC, and more recently, ADAS

tendencies and performance capabilities when attempting to avoid obstacles
while driving passenger vehicles. Now that autonomous vehicles are being
developed with obstacle avoidance capabilities, it is important to target
performance that meets or exceeds that of human drivers. This manuscript
highlights systems that are crucial for an emergency obstacle avoidance
maneuver (EOAM) and identifies the state-of-the-art for each of the related
systems, while considering the nuances of traveling at highway speeds. Some of
the primary EOAM-related systems/areas that are discussed in this review are:
general path planning methods, system hierarchies, decision-making, trajectory

prediction. However, providing fine-grained, accurate, time-efficient, and
adaptive traffic speed prediction for a growing transportation network where
the size of the network keeps increasing and new traffic detectors are
constantly deployed has not been well studied. To address this issue, this
paper presents DistTune based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the
Nelder-Mead method. Whenever encountering an unprocessed detector, DistTune
decides if it should customize an LSTM model for this detector by comparing the
detector with other processed detectors in terms of the normalized traffic
speed patterns they have observed. If similarity is found, DistTune directly
shares an existing LSTM model with this detector to achieve time-efficient
processing. Otherwise, DistTune customizes an LSTM model for the detector to
achieve fine-grained prediction. To make DistTune even more time-efficient,
DistTune performs on a cluster of computing nodes in parallel. To achieve
adaptive traffic speed prediction, DistTune also provides LSTM re-customization
for detectors that suffer from unsatisfactory prediction accuracy due to for
instance traffic speed pattern change. Extensive experiments based on traffic
data collected from freeway I5-N in California are conducted to evaluate the
performance of DistTune. The results demonstrate that DistTune provides
fine-grained, accurate, time-efficient, and adaptive traffic speed prediction

distrusting parties. Model updates, rather than training data, are concentrated
and fused in a central aggregation server. A key security challenge in FL is
that an untrustworthy or compromised aggregation process might lead to
unforeseeable information leakage. This challenge is especially acute due to
recently demonstrated attacks that have reconstructed large fractions of
training data from ostensibly "sanitized" model updates.

In this paper, we introduce TRUDA, a new cross-silo FL system, employing a
trustworthy and decentralized aggregation architecture to break down
information concentration with regard to a single aggregator. Based on the
unique computational properties of model-fusion algorithms, all exchanged model
updates in TRUDA are disassembled at the parameter-granularity and re-stitched
to random partitions designated for multiple TEE-protected aggregators. Thus,
each aggregator only has a fragmentary and shuffled view of model updates and
is oblivious to the model architecture. Our new security mechanisms can
fundamentally mitigate training reconstruction attacks, while still preserving
the final accuracy of trained models and keeping performance overheads low.]]></summary>

that sampling from $X$ according to its Lewis weights and outputting the

analogous to the performance of sampling according to leverage scores for

often facing the challenge of complex heterogeneity. The newly collected data
usually consist of multiple modalities and characterized with multiple labels,
thus exhibiting the co-existence of multiple types of heterogeneity. Although
state-of-the-art techniques are good at modeling the complex heterogeneity with
sufficient label information, such label information can be quite expensive to
obtain in real applications, leading to sub-optimal performance using these
techniques. Inspired by the capability of contrastive learning to utilize rich
unlabeled data for improving performance, in this paper, we propose a unified
heterogeneous learning framework, which combines both weighted unsupervised
contrastive loss and weighted supervised contrastive loss to model multiple
types of heterogeneity. We also provide theoretical analyses showing that the
proposed weighted supervised contrastive loss is the lower bound of the mutual
information of two samples from the same class and the weighted unsupervised
contrastive loss is the lower bound of the mutual information between the
hidden representation of two views of the same sample. Experimental results on
real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the
proposed method modeling multiple types of heterogeneity.]]></summary>

critical to their success in real-world applications. However, when taken to
the extreme, methods that promote robustness can hurt the model's sensitivity
to rare or underrepresented patterns. In this paper, we discuss this trade-off
between sensitivity and robustness to natural (non-adversarial) perturbations
by introducing two notions: contextual feature utility and contextual feature
sensitivity. We propose Feature Contrastive Learning (FCL) that encourages a
model to be more sensitive to the features that have higher contextual utility.
Empirical results demonstrate that models trained with FCL achieve a better
balance of robustness and sensitivity, leading to improved generalization in
the presence of noise on both vision and NLP datasets.]]></summary>

prominently in the models for both sets of models. Blood osmolality, family

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While imitation learning for vision based autonomous mobile robot navigation
has recently received a great deal of attention in the research community,
existing approaches typically require state action demonstrations that were
gathered using the deployment platform. However, what if one cannot easily
outfit their platform to record these demonstration signals or worse yet the
demonstrator does not have access to the platform at all? Is imitation learning
for vision based autonomous navigation even possible in such scenarios? In this
work, we hypothesize that the answer is yes and that recent ideas from the
Imitation from Observation (IfO) literature can be brought to bear such that a
robot can learn to navigate using only ego centric video collected by a
demonstrator, even in the presence of viewpoint mismatch. To this end, we
introduce a new algorithm, Visual Observation only Imitation Learning for
Autonomous navigation (VOILA), that can successfully learn navigation policies
from a single video demonstration collected from a physically different agent.
We evaluate VOILA in the photorealistic AirSim simulator and show that VOILA
not only successfully imitates the expert, but that it also learns navigation
policies that can generalize to novel environments. Further, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of VOILA in a real world setting by showing that it allows a
wheeled Jackal robot to successfully imitate a human walking in an environment
using a video recorded using a mobile phone camera.]]></summary>

learning applications, the optimality, reproducibility and cost of NAS schemes
remain hard to assess. In this paper, we propose Generative Adversarial NAS

importance sampling, GA-NAS iteratively fits a generator to previously

approach, where the generator is trained by reinforcement learning based on
rewards provided by a discriminator, thus being able to explore the search
space without evaluating a large number of architectures. Extensive experiments
show that GA-NAS beats the best published results under several cases on three
public NAS benchmarks. In the meantime, GA-NAS can handle ad-hoc search
constraints and search spaces. We show that GA-NAS can be used to improve
already optimized baselines found by other NAS methods, including EfficientNet
and ProxylessNAS, in terms of ImageNet accuracy or the number of parameters, in

their model updates (gradients), while their raw data remains local on their
devices. In contrast to the common belief that this provides privacy benefits,
we here add to the very recent results on privacy risks when sharing gradients.
Specifically, we propose Label Leakage from Gradients (LLG), a novel attack to
extract the labels of the users' training data from their shared gradients. The
attack exploits the direction and magnitude of gradients to determine the
presence or absence of any label. LLG is simple yet effective, capable of
leaking potential sensitive information represented by labels, and scales well
to arbitrary batch sizes and multiple classes. We empirically and
mathematically demonstrate the validity of our attack under different settings.
Moreover, empirical results show that LLG successfully extracts labels with
high accuracy at the early stages of model training. We also discuss different
defense mechanisms against such leakage. Our findings suggest that gradient
compression is a practical technique to prevent our attack.]]></summary>

the software development process. In this work we present DeepDebug, an
approach to automated debugging using large, pretrained transformers. We begin
by training a bug-creation model on reversed commit data for the purpose of
generating synthetic bugs. We apply these synthetic bugs toward two ends.
First, we directly train a backtranslation model on all functions from 200K
repositories. Next, we focus on 10K repositories for which we can execute
tests, and create buggy versions of all functions in those repositories that
are covered by passing tests. This provides us with rich debugging information
such as stack traces and print statements, which we use to finetune our model
which was pretrained on raw source code. Finally, we strengthen all our models
by expanding the context window beyond the buggy function itself, and adding a
skeleton consisting of that function's parent class, imports, signatures,
docstrings, and method bodies, in order of priority. On the QuixBugs benchmark,
we increase the total number of fixes found by over 50%, while also decreasing
the false positive rate from 35% to 5% and decreasing the timeout from six
hours to one minute. On our own benchmark of executable tests, our model fixes
68% of all bugs on its first attempt without using traces, and after adding
traces it fixes 75% on first attempt. We will open-source our framework and
validation set for evaluating on executable tests.]]></summary>

osteoporosis, usually measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Due
to the limited accessibility of DEXA machines and examinations, osteoporosis is
often under-diagnosed and under-treated, leading to increased fragility
fracture risks. Thus it is highly desirable to obtain BMDs with alternative
cost-effective and more accessible medical imaging examinations such as X-ray
plain films. In this work, we formulate the BMD estimation from plain hip X-ray
images as a regression problem. Specifically, we propose a new semi-supervised
self-training algorithm to train the BMD regression model using images coupled
with DEXA measured BMDs and unlabeled images with pseudo BMDs. Pseudo BMDs are
generated and refined iteratively for unlabeled images during self-training. We
also present a novel adaptive triplet loss to improve the model's regression
accuracy. On an in-house dataset of 1,090 images (819 unique patients), our BMD
estimation method achieves a high Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8805 to
ground-truth BMDs. It offers good feasibility to use the more accessible and
cheaper X-ray imaging for opportunistic osteoporosis screening.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has demonstrated great potential in
quantifying tissue susceptibility in various brain diseases. However, the
intrinsic ill-posed inverse problem relating the tissue phase to the underlying
susceptibility distribution affects the accuracy for quantifying tissue
susceptibility. Recently, deep learning has shown promising results to improve
accuracy by reducing the streaking artifacts. However, there exists a mismatch
between the observed phase and the theoretical forward phase estimated by the
susceptibility label. In this study, we proposed a model-based deep learning
architecture that followed the STI (susceptibility tensor imaging) physical
model, referred to as MoDL-QSM. Specifically, MoDL-QSM accounts for the
relationship between STI-derived phase contrast induced by the susceptibility
tensor terms (ki13,ki23,ki33) and the acquired single-orientation phase. The
convolution neural networks are embedded into the physical model to learn a
regularization term containing prior information. ki33 and phase induced by
ki13 and ki23 terms were used as the labels for network training. Quantitative
evaluation metrics (RSME, SSIM, and HFEN) were compared with recently developed
deep learning QSM methods. The results showed that MoDL-QSM achieved superior
performance, demonstrating its potential for future applications.]]></summary>

of past 3D skeletons. While this problem has recently received increasing
attention, it has mostly been tackled for single humans in isolation. In this
paper we explore this problem from a novel perspective, involving humans
performing collaborative tasks. We assume that the input of our system are two
sequences of past skeletons for two interacting persons, and we aim to predict
the future motion for each of them. For this purpose, we devise a novel cross
interaction attention mechanism that exploits historical information of both
persons and learns to predict cross dependencies between self poses and the
poses of the other person in spite of their spatial or temporal distance. Since
no dataset to train such interactive situations is available, we have captured
ExPI (Extreme Pose Interaction), a new lab-based person interaction dataset of
professional dancers performing acrobatics. ExPI contains 115 sequences with
30k frames and 60k instances with annotated 3D body poses and shapes. We
thoroughly evaluate our cross-interaction network on this dataset and show that
both in short-term and long-term predictions, it consistently outperforms
baselines that independently reason for each person. We plan to release our
code jointly with the dataset and the train/test splits to spur future research

obtained to determine the extent of lung disease and are a valuable source of
data for creating artificial intelligence models. Most work to date assessing
disease severity on chest imaging has focused on segmenting computed tomography
(CT) images; however, given that CTs are performed much less frequently than
chest X-rays for COVID-19 patients, automated lung lesion segmentation on chest
X-rays could be clinically valuable. There currently exists a universal
shortage of chest X-rays with ground truth COVID-19 lung lesion annotations,
and manually contouring lung opacities is a tedious, labor-intensive task. To
accelerate severity detection and augment the amount of publicly available
chest X-ray training data for supervised deep learning (DL) models, we leverage
existing annotated CT images to generate frontal projection "chest X-ray"
images for training COVID-19 chest X-ray models. In this paper, we propose an
automated pipeline for segmentation of COVID-19 lung lesions on chest X-rays
comprised of a Mask R-CNN trained on a mixed dataset of open-source chest
X-rays and coronal X-ray projections computed from annotated volumetric CTs. On
a test set containing 40 chest X-rays of COVID-19 positive patients, our model
achieved IoU scores of 0.81 $\pm$ 0.03 and 0.79 $\pm$ 0.03 when trained on a
dataset of 60 chest X-rays and on a mixed dataset of 10 chest X-rays and 50
projections from CTs, respectively. Our model far outperforms current baselines
with limited supervised training and may assist in automated COVID-19 severity
quantification on chest X-rays.]]></summary>

image onto another image while retaining its content. Existing approaches
commonly leverage various normalization techniques, although these face
limitations in adequately transferring diverse textures to different spatial
locations. Self-Attention-based approaches have tackled this issue with partial
success but suffer from unwanted artifacts. Motivated by these observations,
this paper aims to combine the best of both worlds: self-attention and
normalization. That yields a new plug-and-play module that we name
Self-Attentive Factorized Instance Normalization (SAFIN). SAFIN is essentially
a spatially adaptive normalization module whose parameters are inferred through
attention on the content and style image. We demonstrate that plugging SAFIN
into the base network of another state-of-the-art method results in enhanced
stylization. We also develop a novel base network composed of Wavelet Transform
for multi-scale style transfer, which when combined with SAFIN, produces
visually appealing results with lesser unwanted textures.]]></summary>

blood volume changes, may be especially useful for widespread contactless
health monitoring using face video from consumer-grade visible-light cameras.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the widespread use of protective face masks.
We found that occlusions from cloth face masks increased the mean absolute
error of heart rate estimation by more than 80\% when deploying methods
designed on unmasked faces. We show that augmenting unmasked face videos by
adding patterned synthetic face masks forces the model to attend to the
periocular and forehead regions, improving performance and closing the gap
between masked and unmasked pulse estimation. To our knowledge, this paper is
the first to analyse the impact of face masks on the accuracy of pulse
estimation and offers several novel contributions: (a) 3D CNN-based method
designed for remote photoplethysmography in a presence of face masks, (b) two
publicly available pulse estimation datasets acquired from 86 unmasked and 61
masked subjects, (c) evaluations of handcrafted algorithms and a 3D CNN trained
on videos of unmasked faces and with masks synthetically added, and (d) data
augmentation method to add a synthetic mask to a face video.]]></summary>

problem for visual perception of mobile robots. In this letter, we propose the
use of topologically persistent features, which rely on the objects' shape
information, to address this challenge. In particular, we extract two kinds of
features, namely, sparse persistence image (PI) and amplitude, by applying
persistent homology to multi-directional height function-based filtrations of
the cubical complexes representing the object segmentation maps. The features
are then used to train a fully connected network for recognition. For
performance evaluation, in addition to a widely used shape dataset and a
benchmark indoor scenes dataset, we collect a new dataset, comprising scene
images from two different environments, namely, a living room and a mock
warehouse. The scenes are captured using varying camera poses under different
illumination conditions and include up to five different objects from a given
set of fourteen objects. On the benchmark indoor scenes dataset, sparse PI
features show better recognition performance in unseen environments than the
features learned using the widely used ResNetV2-56 and EfficientNet-B4 models.
Further, they provide slightly higher recall and accuracy values than Faster
R-CNN, an end-to-end object detection method, and its state-of-the-art variant,
Domain Adaptive Faster R-CNN. The performance of our methods also remains
relatively unchanged from the training environment (living room) to the unseen
environment (mock warehouse) in the new dataset. In contrast, the performance
of the object detection methods drops substantially. We also implement the
proposed method on a real-world robot to demonstrate its usefulness.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been attached great importance due to
their biological plausibility and high energy-efficiency on neuromorphic chips.
As these chips are usually resource-constrained, the compression of SNNs is
thus crucial along the road of practical use of SNNs. Most existing methods
directly apply pruning approaches in artificial neural networks (ANNs) to SNNs,
which ignore the difference between ANNs and SNNs, thus limiting the
performance of the pruned SNNs. Besides, these methods are only suitable for
shallow SNNs. In this paper, inspired by synaptogenesis and synapse elimination
in the neural system, we propose gradient rewiring (Grad R), a joint learning
algorithm of connectivity and weight for SNNs, that enables us to seamlessly
optimize network structure without retrain. Our key innovation is to redefine
the gradient to a new synaptic parameter, allowing better exploration of
network structures by taking full advantage of the competition between pruning
and regrowth of connections. The experimental results show that the proposed
method achieves minimal loss of SNNs' performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset
so far. Moreover, it reaches a $\sim$3.5% accuracy loss under unprecedented
0.73% connectivity, which reveals remarkable structure refining capability in
SNNs. Our work suggests that there exists extremely high redundancy in deep
SNNs. Our codes are available at

solar in the energy mix. On a short time scale, fish-eye cameras on the ground
are used to capture cloud displacements causing the local variability of the
electricity production. As most of the solar radiation comes directly from the
Sun, current forecasting approaches use its position in the image as a
reference to interpret the cloud cover dynamics. However, existing Sun tracking
methods rely on external data and a calibration of the camera, which requires
access to the device. To address these limitations, this study introduces an
image-based Sun tracking algorithm to localise the Sun in the image when it is
visible and interpolate its daily trajectory from past observations. We
validate the method on a set of sky images collected over a year at SIRTA's
lab. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides robust smooth
Sun trajectories with a mean absolute error below 1% of the image size.]]></summary>

due to the `reality gap' where the simulator is unable to accurately capture
the dynamics and visual properties of the real world. Current approaches to
tackle this problem, such as domain randomization, require prior knowledge and
engineering to determine how much to randomize system parameters in order to
learn a policy that is robust to sim-to-real transfer while also not being too
conservative. We propose a method for automatically tuning simulator system
parameters to match the real world using only raw RGB images of the real world
without the need to define rewards or estimate state. Our key insight is to
reframe the auto-tuning of parameters as a search problem where we iteratively
shift the simulation system parameters to approach the real-world system
parameters. We propose a Search Param Model (SPM) that, given a sequence of
observations and actions and a set of system parameters, predicts whether the
given parameters are higher or lower than the true parameters used to generate
the observations. We evaluate our method on multiple robotic control tasks in
both sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfer, demonstrating significant improvement

interpretation, reservoir characterization and well placement. Some recent
works regard it as an image segmentation task. The task of image segmentation
requires huge labels, especially 3D seismic data, which has a complex structure
and lots of noise. Therefore, its annotation requires expert experience and a
huge workload. In this study, we present {\lambda}-BCE and {\lambda}-smooth
L1loss to effectively train 3D-CNN by some slices from 3D seismic data, so that
the model can learn the segmentation of 3D seismic data from a few 2D slices.
In order to fully extract information from limited data and suppress seismic
noise, we propose an attention module that can be used for active supervision
training and embedded in the network. The attention heatmap target is generated
by the original label, and letting it supervise the attention module using the
{\lambda}-smooth L1loss. The experiment proves the effectiveness of our loss
function and attention module, it also shows that our method can extract 3D
seismic features from a few 2D slices labels, and the segmentation effect
achieves state-of-the-art. We only use 3.3% of the all labels, and we can
achieve similar performance as using all labels. This work has been submitted

metric learning into a multi-task autoencoder to learn a compact and
discriminative latent representation from EEG and perform classification
simultaneously. This approach reduces the complexity in pre-processing, results
in significant performance improvement on EEG classification. Experimental
results in a subject-independent manner show that MIN2Net outperforms the
state-of-the-art techniques, achieving an F1-score improvement of 6.72%, and
2.23% on the SMR-BCI, and OpenBMI datasets, respectively. We demonstrate that

and performance improvement in the semiconductor industry. As silicon scaling
slows down, the industry is increasingly dependent on IC package technologies
to contribute to further circuit integration and performance improvements. This
is a paradigm shift and requires the IC package industry to reduce the size and
increase the density of internal interconnects on a scale which has never been
done before. Traditional package characterization and process optimization
relies on destructive techniques such as physical cross-sections and delayering
to extract data from internal package features. These destructive techniques
are not practical with today's advanced packages. In this paper we will
demonstrate how data acquired non-destructively with a 3D X-ray microscope can
be enhanced and optimized using machine learning, and can then be used to
measure, characterize and optimize the design and production of buried
interconnects in advanced IC packages. Test vehicles replicating 2.5D and HBM
construction were designed and fabricated, and digital data was extracted from
these test vehicles using 3D X-ray and machine learning techniques. The
extracted digital data was used to characterize and optimize the design and
production of the interconnects and demonstrates a superior alternative to
destructive physical analysis. We report an mAP of 0.96 for 3D object
detection, a dice score of 0.92 for 3D segmentation, and an average of 2.1um
error for 3D metrology on the test dataset. This paper is the first part of a
multi-part report.]]></summary>

of pedestrians. This is the reason why forecasting pedestrians' intentions
sufficiently in advance is one of the most critical and challenging tasks for
autonomous vehicles. This work tries to solve this problem by jointly
predicting the intention and visual states of pedestrians. In terms of visual
states, whereas previous work focused on x-y coordinates, we will also predict
the size and indeed the whole bounding box of the pedestrian. The method is a
recurrent neural network in a multi-task learning approach. It has one head
that predicts the intention of the pedestrian for each one of its future
position and another one predicting the visual states of the pedestrian.
Experiments on the JAAD dataset show the superiority of the performance of our
method compared to previous works for intention prediction. Also, although its
simple architecture (more than 2 times faster), the performance of the bounding
box prediction is comparable to the ones yielded by much more complex
architectures. Our code is available online.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The objective of this work is person-clustering in videos -- grouping
characters according to their identity. Previous methods focus on the narrower
task of face-clustering, and for the most part ignore other cues such as the
person's voice, their overall appearance (hair, clothes, posture), and the
editing structure of the videos. Similarly, most current datasets evaluate only
the task of face-clustering, rather than person-clustering. This limits their
applicability to downstream applications such as story understanding which
require person-level, rather than only face-level, reasoning. In this paper we
make contributions to address both these deficiencies: first, we introduce a
Multi-Modal High-Precision Clustering algorithm for person-clustering in videos
using cues from several modalities (face, body, and voice). Second, we
introduce a Video Person-Clustering dataset, for evaluating multi-modal
person-clustering. It contains body-tracks for each annotated character,
face-tracks when visible, and voice-tracks when speaking, with their associated
features. The dataset is by far the largest of its kind, and covers films and
TV-shows representing a wide range of demographics. Finally, we show the
effectiveness of using multiple modalities for person-clustering, explore the
use of this new broad task for story understanding through character
co-occurrences, and achieve a new state of the art on all available datasets
for face and person-clustering.]]></summary>

comprehensive algorithm for the implementation of parallelizable SNNs and LSMs
that are GPU-compatible. We implement the PLSM model to classify
unintentional/accidental video clips, using the Oops dataset. From the
experimental results on detecting unintentional action in video, it can be
observed that our proposed model outperforms a self-supervised model and a
fully supervised traditional deep learning model. All the implemented codes can

networks, which enable our model to learn not only the label dependency but
also the relationship between the anatomical regions in the chest X-ray. We
further utilize a method to efficiently create an adjacency matrix for the
anatomical regions using the correlation of the label across the different
regions. Detailed experiments and analysis of our results show the

to the growing accessibility to various forms of spatial big data, increasing
computing power, and use cases benefiting from such information. The methods
developed up to now measure urban morphology with numerical indices describing
density, proportion, and mixture, but they do not directly represent
morphological features from human's visual and intuitive perspective. We take
the first step to bridge the gap by proposing a deep learning-based technique
to automatically classify road networks into four classes on a visual basis.
The method is implemented by generating an image of the street network (Colored
Road Hierarchy Diagram), which we introduce in this paper, and classifying it
using a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-34). The model achieves an
overall classification accuracy of 0.875. Nine cities around the world are
selected as the study areas and their road networks are acquired from
OpenStreetMap. Latent subgroups among the cities are uncovered through a
clustering on the percentage of each road network category. In the subsequent
part of the paper, we focus on the usability of such classification: the
effectiveness of our human perception augmentation is examined by a case study
of urban vitality prediction. An advanced tree-based regression model is for
the first time designated to establish the relationship between morphological
indices and vitality indicators. A positive effect of human perception
augmentation is detected in the comparative experiment of baseline model and
augmented model. This work expands the toolkit of quantitative urban morphology
study with new techniques, supporting further studies in the future.]]></summary>

parking systems build a local map to be able to plan for maneuvering towards a

build a persistent map of the environment where the car is frequently parked,

re-localizing the vehicle better when its trying to park the next time. This is
achieved by augmenting the parking system with a Visual SLAM pipeline and the
feature is called trained trajectory parking in the automotive industry. In
this paper, we discuss the use cases, design and implementation of a trained

images in a dataset to a unique shape, while reducing their precision to a size
which facilitates experimentation at scale. This practice has benefits from a
computational perspective, but it entails negative side-effects on performance
due to loss of information and image deformation. In this work we introduce the
MAMe dataset, an image classification dataset with remarkable high resolution
and variable shape properties. The goal of MAMe is to provide a tool for
studying the impact of such properties in image classification, while
motivating research in the field. The MAMe dataset contains thousands of
artworks from three different museums, and proposes a classification task
consisting on differentiating between 29 mediums (i.e. materials and
techniques) supervised by art experts. After reviewing the singularity of MAMe
in the context of current image classification tasks, a thorough description of
the task is provided, together with dataset statistics. Experiments are
conducted to evaluate the impact of using high resolution images, variable
shape inputs and both properties at the same time. Results illustrate the
positive impact in performance when using high resolution images, while
highlighting the lack of solutions to exploit variable shapes. An additional
experiment exposes the distinctiveness between the MAMe dataset and the
prototypical ImageNet dataset. Finally, the baselines are inspected using
explainability methods and expert knowledge, to gain insights on the challenges
that remain ahead.]]></summary>

strongly indicative of cerebral palsy in infants. Developing computer-based
methods for assessing infant movements in videos is pivotal for improved
cerebral palsy screening. Most existing methods use appearance-based features
and are thus sensitive to strong but irrelevant signals caused by background
clutter or a moving camera. Moreover, these features are computed over the
whole frame, thus they measure gross whole body movements rather than specific
joint/limb motion.

Addressing these challenges, we develop and validate a new method for fidgety
movement assessment from consumer-grade videos using human poses extracted from
short clips. Human poses capture only relevant motion profiles of joints and
limbs and are thus free from irrelevant appearance artifacts. The dynamics and
coordination between joints are modeled using spatio-temporal graph
convolutional networks. Frames and body parts that contain discriminative
information about fidgety movements are selected through a spatio-temporal
attention mechanism. We validate the proposed model on the cerebral palsy
screening task using a real-life consumer-grade video dataset collected at an
Australian hospital through the Cerebral Palsy Alliance, Australia. Our
experiments show that the proposed method achieves the ROC-AUC score of 81.87%,
significantly outperforming existing competing methods with better
interpretability.]]></summary>

e.g., large pose, bad illumination,low resolution, blur and noise. To address
these challenges, previous efforts usually first restore the low-quality faces
to high-quality ones and then perform face recognition. However, most of these
methods are stage-wise, which is sub-optimal and deviates from the reality. In
this paper, we address all these challenges jointly for unconstrained face
recognition. We propose an Multi-Degradation Face Restoration (MDFR) model to
restore frontalized high-quality faces from the given low-quality ones under
arbitrary facial poses, with three distinct novelties. First, MDFR is a
well-designed encoder-decoder architecture which extracts feature
representation from an input face image with arbitrary low-quality factors and
restores it to a high-quality counterpart. Second, MDFR introduces a pose
residual learning strategy along with a 3D-based Pose Normalization Module
(PNM), which can perceive the pose gap between the input initial pose and its
real-frontal pose to guide the face frontalization. Finally, MDFR can generate
frontalized high-quality face images by a single unified network, showing a
strong capability of preserving face identity. Qualitative and quantitative
experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of MDFR over state-of-the-art methods on both face frontalization
and face restoration.]]></summary>

image from a downward facing camera to infer pressure on a body at rest in bed
occluded by bedding, which is directly applicable to the prevention of pressure
injuries in healthcare. Our approach involves augmenting a real dataset with
synthetic data generated via a soft-body physics simulation of a human body, a

network that we trained on an augmented dataset and evaluated with real data.
The network contains an embedded human body mesh model and uses a white-box

techniques. While these techniques have traditionally focused on pruning
pre-trained NN (LeCun et al.,1990; Hassibi et al., 1993), recent work by Lee et
al. (2018) has shown promising results when pruning at initialization. However,
for Deep NNs, such procedures remain unsatisfactory as the resulting pruned
networks can be difficult to train and, for instance, they do not prevent one
layer from being fully pruned. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive

part because even though they are trained with datasets many orders of
magnitude smaller than the full population of possible images, they exhibit
sufficient generalization to be applicable to new and previously unseen data.
Although many have examined issues regarding generalization from several
perspectives, we wondered If a network is trained with a biased dataset that
misses particular samples corresponding to some defining domain attribute, can
it generalize to the full domain from which that training dataset was
extracted? It is certainly true that in vision, no current training set fully
captures all visual information and this may lead to Selection Bias. Here, we
try a novel approach in the tradition of the Thought Experiment. We run this
thought experiment on a real domain of visual objects that we can fully
characterize and look at specific gaps in training data and their impact on
performance requirements. Our thought experiment points to three conclusions:
first, that generalization behavior is dependent on how sufficiently the
particular dimensions of the domain are represented during training; second,
that the utility of any generalization is completely dependent on the
acceptable system error; and third, that specific visual features of objects,
such as pose orientations out of the imaging plane or colours, may not be
recoverable if not represented sufficiently in a training set. Any currently
observed generalization in modern deep learning networks may be more the result
of coincidental alignments and whose utility needs to be confirmed with respect
to a system's performance specification. Our Thought Experiment Probe approach,
coupled with the resulting Bias Breakdown can be very informative towards
understanding the impact of biases.]]></summary>

viable 3D gaze supervision from LAEO labels, we propose a training algorithm
along with several novel loss functions especially designed for the task. With
weak supervision from two large scale CMU-Panoptic and AVA-LAEO activity

using images from two different perspectives and also benchmark on the standard
MNIST dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach
exceeds the state-of-the-art on both the MNIST and dices datasets. To the best

instances where depth sensors cannot be used, this distance has to be estimated
from RGB cameras. As opposed to cars, the task of estimating depth from
on-board mounted cameras is made complex on drones because of the lack of
constrains on motion during flights. %In the case of drones, this task is even
more complex than for car-mounted cameras since the camera motion is
unconstrained. In this paper, we present a method to estimate the distance of
objects seen by an on-board mounted camera by using its RGB video stream and
drone motion information. Our method is built upon a pyramidal convolutional
neural network architecture and uses time recurrence in pair with geometric
constraints imposed by motion to produce pixel-wise depth maps. %from a RGB
video stream of a camera attached to the drone In our architecture, each level
of the pyramid is designed to produce its own depth estimate based on past
observations and information provided by the previous level in the pyramid. We
introduce a spatial reprojection layer to maintain the spatio-temporal
consistency of the data between the levels. We analyse the performance of our
approach on Mid-Air, a public drone dataset featuring synthetic drone
trajectories recorded in a wide variety of unstructured outdoor environments.
Our experiments show that our network outperforms state-of-the-art depth
estimation methods and that the use of motion information is the main
contributing factor for this improvement. The code of our method is publicly
available on GitHub; see

are very expensive and thus inaccessible to most players. Motivated to develop
a more accessible low-cost solution, we present a new approach to keypoint
detection and apply it to predict dart scores from a single image taken from
any camera angle. This problem involves detecting multiple keypoints that may
be of the same class and positioned in close proximity to one another. The
widely adopted framework for regressing keypoints using heatmaps is not
well-suited for this task. To address this issue, we instead propose to model
keypoints as objects. We develop a deep convolutional neural network around
this idea and use it to predict dart locations and dartboard calibration points
within an overall pipeline for automatic dart scoring, which we call DeepDarts.
Additionally, we propose several task-specific data augmentation strategies to
improve the generalization of our method. As a proof of concept, two datasets
comprising 16k images originating from two different dartboard setups were
manually collected and annotated to evaluate the system. In the primary dataset
containing 15k images captured from a face-on view of the dartboard using a
smartphone, DeepDarts predicted the total score correctly in 94.7% of the test
images. In a second more challenging dataset containing limited training data
(830 images) and various camera angles, we utilize transfer learning and
extensive data augmentation to achieve a test accuracy of 84.0%. Because
DeepDarts relies only on single images, it has the potential to be deployed on
edge devices, giving anyone with a smartphone access to an automatic dart
scoring system for steel-tip darts. The code and datasets are available.]]></summary>

Vision APIs as they offer multiple services including pre-built models and

important that they are robust to different manipulations. Recent works have
only focused on typical adversarial attacks when evaluating the robustness of

and evaluate them on the robustness of Google Cloud Vision API's optical
character recognition service and object detection APIs deployed in real-world

Microsoft Azure's Computer Vision API. Specifically, we go beyond the
conventional small-noise adversarial attacks and introduce secret embedding and
transparent adversarial examples as a simpler way to evaluate robustness. These
methods are so straightforward that even non-specialists can craft such
attacks. As a result, they pose a serious threat where APIs are used for
high-stakes applications. Our transparent adversarial examples successfully
evade state-of-the art object detections APIs such as Azure Cloud Vision
(attack success rate 52%) and Google Cloud Vision (attack success rate 36%).

incorporating a patch-wise rolling network(PRN) to content-adaptively recover

ignore difficulty diversity, we adopt different stage of a neural network to

segmentation demands the model to see the big picture and fine details
simultaneously, i.e., to learn image features that incorporate large context
while keep high spatial resolutions. To approach this goal, the most widely
used methods -- U-Net and variants, extract and fuse multi-scale features.
However, the fused features still have small "effective receptive fields" with
a focus on local image cues, limiting their performance. In this work, we
propose Segtran, an alternative segmentation framework based on transformers,
which have unlimited "effective receptive fields" even at high feature
resolutions. The core of Segtran is a novel Squeeze-and-Expansion transformer:
a squeezed attention block regularizes the self attention of transformers, and
an expansion block learns diversified representations. Additionally, we propose
a new positional encoding scheme for transformers, imposing a continuity
inductive bias for images. Experiments were performed on 2D and 3D medical
image segmentation tasks: optic disc/cup segmentation in fundus images
(REFUGE'20 challenge), polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images, and brain
tumor segmentation in MRI scans (BraTS'19 challenge). Compared with
representative existing methods, Segtran consistently achieved the highest

to its rapid spreading nature through respiratory transmission. As a result,
there is a huge demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based quick disease
diagnosis methods as an alternative to high demand tests such as Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR). Chest X-ray (CXR) Image analysis is such cost-effective
radiography technique due to resource availability and quick screening. But, a
sufficient and systematic data collection that is required by complex deep
leaning (DL) models is more difficult and hence there are recent efforts that
utilize transfer learning to address this issue. Still these transfer learnt
models suffer from lack of generalization and increased bias to the training
dataset resulting poor performance for unseen data. Limited correlation of the
transferred features from the pre-trained model to a specific medical imaging
domain like X-ray and overfitting on fewer data can be reasons for this
circumstance. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Convolution Neural Network
(GCN) that is capable of identifying bio-markers of Covid-19 pneumonia from CXR
images and meta information about patients. The proposed method exploits
important relational knowledge between data instances and their features using
graph representation and applies convolution to learn the graph data which is
not possible with conventional convolution on Euclidean domain. The results of
extensive experiments of proposed model on binary (Covid vs normal) and three

COVID-19. It began to spread at the end of 2019 and has now spread across the
world. Until October 2020, It has infected around 37 million people and claimed
about 1 million lives. We propose a deep learning model that can help
radiologists and clinicians use chest X-rays to diagnose COVID-19 cases and
show the diagnostic features of pneumonia. Methods: The approach in this study
is: 1) we propose a data enhancement method to increase the diversity of the
data set, thereby improving the generalization performance of the model. 2) Our
deep convolution neural network model DPN-SE adds a self-attention mechanism to
the DPN network. The addition of a self-attention mechanism has greatly
improved the performance of the network. 3) Use the Lime interpretable library
to mark the feature regions on the X-ray medical image that helps doctors more
quickly diagnose COVID-19 in people. Results: Under the same network model, the
data with and without data enhancement is put into the model for training
respectively. At last, comparing two experimental results: among the 10 network
models with different structures, 7 network models have improved their effects
after using data enhancement, with an average improvement of 1% in recognition
accuracy. We propose that the accuracy and recall rates of the DPN-SE network
are 93% and 98% of cases (COVID vs. pneumonia bacteria vs. viral pneumonia vs.
normal). Compared with the original DPN, the respective accuracy is improved by
2%. Conclusion: The data augmentation method we used has achieved effective
results on a small amount of data set, showing that a reasonable data
augmentation method can improve the recognition accuracy without changing the
sample size and model structure. Overall, the proposed method and model can
effectively become a very useful tool for clinical radiologists.]]></summary>

few years. The previous hybrid coding approaches rely on pixel space operations
to reduce spatial and temporal redundancy, which may suffer from inaccurate
motion estimation or less effective motion compensation. In this work, we
propose a feature-space video coding network (FVC) by performing all major
operations (i.e., motion estimation, motion compression, motion compensation
and residual compression) in the feature space. Specifically, in the proposed
deformable compensation module, we first apply motion estimation in the feature
space to produce motion information (i.e., the offset maps), which will be
compressed by using the auto-encoder style network. Then we perform motion
compensation by using deformable convolution and generate the predicted
feature. After that, we compress the residual feature between the feature from
the current frame and the predicted feature from our deformable compensation
module. For better frame reconstruction, the reference features from multiple
previous reconstructed frames are also fused by using the non-local attention
mechanism in the multi-frame feature fusion module. Comprehensive experimental

automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and

remarkable improvements in image classification tasks by simultaneously
training multiple classifier heads. However, huge memory footprints required by
such multi-head structures may hinder the training of large-capacity baseline
models. The natural question is how to achieve collaborative learning within a
single network without duplicating any modules. In this paper, we propose four
ways of collaborative learning among different parts of a single network with
negligible engineering efforts. To improve the robustness of the network, we
leverage the consistency of the output layer and intermediate layers for
training under the collaborative learning framework. Besides, the similarity of
intermediate representation and convolution kernel is also introduced to reduce
the reduce redundant in a neural network. Compared to the method of Song and
Chai, our framework further considers the collaboration inside a single model
and takes smaller overhead. Extensive experiments on Cifar-10, Cifar-100,
ImageNet32 and STL-10 corroborate the effectiveness of these four ways
separately while combining them leads to further improvements. In particular,
test errors on the STL-10 dataset are decreased by $9.28\%$ and $5.45\%$ for
ResNet-18 and VGG-16 respectively. Moreover, our method is proven to be robust
to label noise with experiments on Cifar-10 dataset. For example, our method
has $3.53\%$ higher performance under $50\%$ noise ratio setting.]]></summary>

Through analysis on transfer learning based methods, some neglected but
beneficial properties are utilized to design a simple yet effective few-shot
detector, Retentive R-CNN. It consists of Bias-Balanced RPN to debias the
pretrained RPN and Re-detector to find few-shot class objects without
forgetting previous knowledge. Extensive experiments on few-shot detection
benchmarks show that Retentive R-CNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art

on observations of the agent. It is of pivotal importance to design effective
visual representations of the observed scene in determining navigation actions.
In this paper, we introduce a Visual Transformer Network (VTNet) for learning
informative visual representation in navigation. VTNet is a highly effective
structure that embodies two key properties for visual representations: First,
the relationships among all the object instances in a scene are exploited;
Second, the spatial locations of objects and image regions are emphasized so
that directional navigation signals can be learned. Furthermore, we also
develop a pre-training scheme to associate the visual representations with
navigation signals, and thus facilitate navigation policy learning. In a
nutshell, VTNet embeds object and region features with their location cues as
spatial-aware descriptors and then incorporates all the encoded descriptors
through attention operations to achieve informative representation for
navigation. Given such visual representations, agents are able to explore the
correlations between visual observations and navigation actions. For example,
an agent would prioritize "turning right" over "turning left" when the visual
representation emphasizes on the right side of activation map. Experiments in
the artificial environment AI2-Thor demonstrate that VTNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in unseen testing environments.]]></summary>

Most existing methods tend to design skeletal-based graphs to build the
relations among joints, where local interactions between joint pairs are well
learned. However, the global coordination of all joints, which reflects human
motion's balance property, is usually weakened because it is learned from part
to whole progressively and asynchronously. Thus, the final predicted motions
are sometimes unnatural. To tackle this issue, we learn a medium, called
balance attractor (BA), from the spatiotemporal features of motion to
characterize the global motion features, which is subsequently used to build
new joint relations. Through the BA, all joints are related synchronously, and
thus the global coordination of all joints can be better learned. Based on the
BA, we propose our framework, referred to Attractor-Guided Neural Network,
mainly including Attractor-Based Joint Relation Extractor (AJRE) and
Multi-timescale Dynamics Extractor (MTDE). The AJRE mainly includes Global
Coordination Extractor (GCE) and Local Interaction Extractor (LIE). The former
presents the global coordination of all joints, and the latter encodes local
interactions between joint pairs. The MTDE is designed to extract dynamic
information from raw position information for effective prediction. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both short and long-term predictions in H3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW.]]></summary>

problem has not been well studied in spite of a wide range of potential
applications including the preservation of wild animals and the discovery of

proposed network possesses the second branch for classification to predict the
probability of containing camouflaged object(s) in an image, which is then
fused into the main branch for segmentation to boost up the segmentation
accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on the newly built dataset

image analysis. However, supervised training methods have a great demand for
large and high-quality labeled datasets, which is time-consuming and sometimes
impractical due to data sharing issues. Unsupervised image registration
algorithms commonly employ intensity-based similarity measures as loss
functions without any manual annotations. These methods estimate the
parameterized transformations between pairs of moving and fixed images through
the optimization of the network parameters during training. However, these
methods become less effective when the image quality varies, e.g., some images
are corrupted by substantial noise or artifacts. In this work, we propose a
novel approach based on a low-rank representation, i.e., Regnet-LRR, to tackle
the problem. We project noisy images into a noise-free low-rank space, and then
compute the similarity between the images. Based on the low-rank similarity
measure, we train the registration network to predict the dense deformation
fields of noisy image pairs. We highlight that the low-rank projection is
reformulated in a way that the registration network can successfully update
gradients. With two tasks, i.e., cardiac and abdominal intra-modality
registration, we demonstrate that the low-rank representation can boost the
generalization ability and robustness of models as well as bring significant
improvements in noisy data registration scenarios.]]></summary>

different modalities. However, existing attention models could be sub-optimal
and lack preciseness because there is no direct supervision involved during
training. In this work, we propose Contrastive Content Re-sourcing (CCR) and
Contrastive Content Swapping (CCS) constraints to address such limitation.
These constraints supervise the training of attention models in a contrastive
learning manner without requiring explicit attention annotations. Additionally,
we introduce three metrics, namely Attention Precision, Recall and F1-Score, to
quantitatively evaluate the attention quality. We evaluate the proposed
constraints with cross-modal retrieval (image-text matching) task. The
experiments on both Flickr30k and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate that integrating
these attention constraints into two state-of-the-art attention-based models
improves the model performance in terms of both retrieval accuracy and
attention metrics.]]></summary>

carrying much more information than raw pixels. There is an inherent relational
structure to the relationship among different superpixels of an image. This
relational information can convey some form of domain information about the
image, e.g. relationship between superpixels representing two eyes in a cat
image. Our interest in this paper is to construct computer vision models,
specifically those based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to incorporate these
superpixels information. We propose a methodology to construct a hybrid model
that leverages (a) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to deal with spatial
information in an image, and (b) Graph Neural Network (GNN) to deal with
relational superpixel information in the image. The proposed deep model is
learned using a generic hybrid loss function that we call a `hybrid' loss. We
evaluate the predictive performance of our proposed hybrid vision model on four
popular image classification datasets: MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
Moreover, we evaluate our method on three real-world classification tasks:
COVID-19 X-Ray Detection, LFW Face Recognition, and SOCOFing Fingerprint
Identification. The results demonstrate that the relational superpixel
information provided via a GNN could improve the performance of standard
CNN-based vision systems.]]></summary>

vision tasks, with good results. Unlike classic convolution networks, which
extract features within a local receptive field, transformers can adaptively
aggregate similar features from a global view using self-attention mechanism.
For object detection, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) proposes feature
interaction across layers and proves its extremely importance. However, its
interaction is still in a local manner, which leaves a lot of room for
improvement. Since transformer was originally designed for NLP tasks, adapting
processing subject directly from text to image will cause unaffordable
computation and space overhead. In this paper, we utilize a linearized
attention function to overcome above problems and build a novel architecture,
named Content-Augmented Feature Pyramid Network (CA-FPN), which proposes a
global content extraction module and deeply combines with FPN through light
linear transformers. What's more, light transformers can further make the
application of multi-head attention mechanism easier. Most importantly, our
CA-FPN can be readily plugged into existing FPN-based models. Extensive
experiments on the challenging COCO object detection dataset demonstrated that
our CA-FPN significantly outperforms competitive baselines without bells and
whistles. Code will be made publicly available.]]></summary>

often facing the challenge of complex heterogeneity. The newly collected data
usually consist of multiple modalities and characterized with multiple labels,
thus exhibiting the co-existence of multiple types of heterogeneity. Although
state-of-the-art techniques are good at modeling the complex heterogeneity with
sufficient label information, such label information can be quite expensive to
obtain in real applications, leading to sub-optimal performance using these
techniques. Inspired by the capability of contrastive learning to utilize rich
unlabeled data for improving performance, in this paper, we propose a unified
heterogeneous learning framework, which combines both weighted unsupervised
contrastive loss and weighted supervised contrastive loss to model multiple
types of heterogeneity. We also provide theoretical analyses showing that the
proposed weighted supervised contrastive loss is the lower bound of the mutual
information of two samples from the same class and the weighted unsupervised
contrastive loss is the lower bound of the mutual information between the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purpose: To develop an algorithm for robust partial Fourier (PF)
reconstruction applicable to diffusion-weighted (DW) images with non-smooth
phase variations.

Methods: Based on an unrolled proximal splitting algorithm, a neural network
architecture is derived which alternates between data consistency operations
and regularization implemented by recurrent convolutions. In order to exploit
correlations, multiple repetitions of the same slice are jointly reconstructed
under consideration of permutation-equivariance. The proposed method is trained
on DW liver data of 60 volunteers and evaluated on retrospectively and
prospectively sub-sampled data of different anatomies and resolutions. In
addition, the benefits of using a recurrent network over other unrolling
strategies is investigated.

Results: Conventional PF techniques can be significantly outperformed in
terms of quantitative measures as well as perceptual image quality. The
proposed method is able to generalize well to brain data with contrasts and
resolution not present in the training set. The reduction in echo time (TE)
associated with prospective PF-sampling enables DW imaging with higher signal.
Also, the TE increase in acquisitions with higher resolution can be compensated
for. It can be shown that unrolling by means of a recurrent network produced
better results than using a weight-shared network or a cascade of networks.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that robust PF reconstruction of DW data
is feasible even at strong PF factors in applications with severe phase
variations. Since the proposed method does not rely on smoothness priors of the
phase but uses learned recurrent convolutions instead, artifacts of
conventional PF methods can be avoided.]]></summary>

has recently received a great deal of attention in the research community,
existing approaches typically require state action demonstrations that were
gathered using the deployment platform. However, what if one cannot easily
outfit their platform to record these demonstration signals or worse yet the
demonstrator does not have access to the platform at all? Is imitation learning
for vision based autonomous navigation even possible in such scenarios? In this
work, we hypothesize that the answer is yes and that recent ideas from the
Imitation from Observation (IfO) literature can be brought to bear such that a
robot can learn to navigate using only ego centric video collected by a
demonstrator, even in the presence of viewpoint mismatch. To this end, we
introduce a new algorithm, Visual Observation only Imitation Learning for
Autonomous navigation (VOILA), that can successfully learn navigation policies
from a single video demonstration collected from a physically different agent.
We evaluate VOILA in the photorealistic AirSim simulator and show that VOILA
not only successfully imitates the expert, but that it also learns navigation
policies that can generalize to novel environments. Further, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of VOILA in a real world setting by showing that it allows a
wheeled Jackal robot to successfully imitate a human walking in an environment
using a video recorded using a mobile phone camera.]]></summary>

among the most critical issues. Using a tier cache memory (along with branching
prediction) is an effective means of increasing modern multi-core processors'
performance. Designing high-performance processors is a complex task and
requires preliminary verification and analysis of the model level, usually used
in analytical and simulation modeling. The refinement of extreme programming is
an unfortunate challenge. Few experts disagree with the synthesis of access
points. This article demonstrates that Internet QoS and 16-bit architectures
are always incompatible, but it's the same situation for write-back caches. The
solution to this problem can be implemented by analyzing simulation models of
different complexity in combination with the analytical evaluation of
individual algorithms. This work is devoted to designing a multi-parameter
simulation model of a multi-process for evaluating the performance of cache
memory algorithms and the optimality of the structure. Optimization of the
structures and algorithms of the cache memory allows you to accelerate the
interaction of the memory process and improve the performance of the entire
system.]]></summary>

learning applications, the optimality, reproducibility and cost of NAS schemes
remain hard to assess. In this paper, we propose Generative Adversarial NAS
(GA-NAS) with theoretically provable convergence guarantees, promoting
stability and reproducibility in neural architecture search. Inspired by
importance sampling, GA-NAS iteratively fits a generator to previously

approach, where the generator is trained by reinforcement learning based on
rewards provided by a discriminator, thus being able to explore the search
space without evaluating a large number of architectures. Extensive experiments
show that GA-NAS beats the best published results under several cases on three
public NAS benchmarks. In the meantime, GA-NAS can handle ad-hoc search
constraints and search spaces. We show that GA-NAS can be used to improve
already optimized baselines found by other NAS methods, including EfficientNet

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Interactive news recommendation has been launched and attracted much
attention recently. In this scenario, user's behavior evolves from single click
behavior to multiple behaviors including like, comment, share etc. However,
most of the existing methods still use single click behavior as the unique
criterion of judging user's preferences. Further, although heterogeneous graphs
have been applied in different areas, a proper way to construct a heterogeneous
graph for interactive news data with an appropriate learning mechanism on it is
still desired. To address the above concerns, we propose a graph-based
behavior-aware network, which simultaneously considers six different types of
behaviors as well as user's demand on the news diversity. We have three main
steps. First, we build an interaction behavior graph for multi-level and
multi-category data. Second, we apply DeepWalk on the behavior graph to obtain
entity semantics, then build a graph-based convolutional neural network called
G-CNN to learn news representations, and an attention-based LSTM to learn
behavior sequence representations. Third, we introduce core and coritivity
features for the behavior graph, which measure the concentration degree of
user's interests. These features affect the trade-off between accuracy and
diversity of our personalized recommendation system. Taking these features into
account, our system finally achieves recommending news to different users at
their different levels of concentration degrees.]]></summary>

systems to explicitly acquire user preferences towards items and attributes
through interactive conversations. Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely
adopted to learn conversational recommendation policies to decide what
attributes to ask, which items to recommend, and when to ask or recommend, at
each conversation turn. However, existing methods mainly target at solving one
or two of these three decision-making problems in CRS with separated
conversation and recommendation components, which restrict the scalability and
generality of CRS and fall short of preserving a stable training procedure. In
the light of these challenges, we propose to formulate these three
decision-making problems in CRS as a unified policy learning task. In order to
systematically integrate conversation and recommendation components, we develop
a dynamic weighted graph based RL method to learn a policy to select the action
at each conversation turn, either asking an attribute or recommending items.
Further, to deal with the sample efficiency issue, we propose two action
selection strategies for reducing the candidate action space according to the
preference and entropy information. Experimental results on two benchmark CRS
datasets and a real-world E-Commerce application show that the proposed method
not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also enhances
the scalability and stability of CRS.]]></summary>

approaches for tackling this problem include graphical query interfaces, query
by navigation, query by construction, and point to point queries. In this

based on ideas from the information retrieval world, in particular on the
stratified hypermedia architecture. When using our approach to the formulations
of queries, a user will first formulate a number of simple queries
corresponding to linear paths through the information structure. The
formulation of the linear paths is the result of the {\em explorative phase} of
the query formulation. Once users have specified a number of these linear
paths, they may combine them to form more complex queries. Examples of such
combinations are: concatenation, union, intersection and selection. This last
process is referred to as {\em query by construction}, and is the {\em
constructive phase} of the query formulation process.]]></summary>

of symbolic representations, the family of symbolic aggregate approximations
(SAX) has been used extensively for encoding time series data. However, typical
SAX-based methods rely on two restrictive assumptions; the Gaussian
distribution and equiprobable symbols. This paper proposes two novel
data-driven SAX-based symbolic representations, distinguished by their
discretization steps. The first representation, oriented for general data
compaction and indexing scenarios, is based on the combination of kernel
density estimation and Lloyd-Max quantization to minimize the information loss
and mean squared error in the discretization step. The second method, oriented
for high-level mining tasks, employs the Mean-Shift clustering method and is
shown to enhance anomaly detection in the lower-dimensional space. Besides, we
verify on a theoretical basis a previously observed phenomenon of the intrinsic
process that results in a lower than the expected variance of the intermediate
piecewise aggregate approximation. This phenomenon causes an additional
information loss but can be avoided with a simple modification. The proposed
representations possess all the attractive properties of the conventional SAX
method. Furthermore, experimental evaluation on real-world datasets
demonstrates their superiority compared to the traditional SAX and an

society since a growing number of users use them for information seeking and
decision making. Therefore, it is crucial to address the potential unfairness
problems in recommendations. Just like users have personalized preferences on
items, users' demands for fairness are also personalized in many scenarios.
Therefore, it is important to provide personalized fair recommendations for
users to satisfy their personalized fairness demands. Besides, previous works
on fair recommendation mainly focus on association-based fairness. However, it
is important to advance from associative fairness notions to causal fairness
notions for assessing fairness more properly in recommender systems. Based on
the above considerations, this paper focuses on achieving personalized
counterfactual fairness for users in recommender systems. To this end, we
introduce a framework for achieving counterfactually fair recommendations
through adversary learning by generating feature-independent user embeddings
for recommendation. The framework allows recommender systems to achieve
personalized fairness for users while also covering non-personalized

information retrieval with graph-based indices being the current
state-of-the-art and widely used in the industry. Recent advances in
graph-based indices have made it possible to index and search billion-point
datasets with high recall and millisecond-level latency on a single commodity
machine with an SSD.

However, existing graph algorithms for ANNS support only static indices that
cannot reflect real-time changes to the corpus required by many key real-world
scenarios (e.g. index of sentences in documents, email, or a news index). To
overcome this drawback, the current industry practice for manifesting updates
into such indices is to periodically re-build these indices, which can be
prohibitively expensive.

In this paper, we present the first graph-based ANNS index that reflects
corpus updates into the index in real-time without compromising on search
performance. Using update rules for this index, we design FreshDiskANN, a
system that can index over a billion points on a workstation with an SSD and
limited memory, and support thousands of concurrent real-time inserts, deletes
and searches per second each, while retaining $>95\%$ 5-recall@5. This
represents a 5-10x reduction in the cost of maintaining freshness in indices

document re-ranking involves utilizing large pre-trained language models -
e.g., BERT - to evaluate all individual passages in the document and then
aggregating the outputs by pooling or additional Transformer layers. A major
drawback of this approach is high query latency due to the cost of evaluating
every passage in the document with BERT. To make matters worse, this high
inference cost and latency varies based on the length of the document, with
longer documents requiring more time and computation. To address this
challenge, we adopt an intra-document cascading strategy, which prunes passages
of a candidate document using a less expensive model, called ESM, before
running a scoring model that is more expensive and effective, called ETM. We
found it best to train ESM (short for Efficient Student Model) via knowledge
distillation from the ETM (short for Effective Teacher Model) e.g., BERT. This
pruning allows us to only run the ETM model on a smaller set of passages whose
size does not vary by document length. Our experiments on the MS MARCO and TREC
Deep Learning Track benchmarks suggest that the proposed Intra-Document
Cascaded Ranking Model (IDCM) leads to over 400% lower query latency by
providing essentially the same effectiveness as the state-of-the-art BERT-based

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning from implicit feedback is one of the most common cases in the
application of recommender systems. Generally speaking, interacted examples are
considered as positive while negative examples are sampled from uninteracted
ones. However, noisy examples are prevalent in real-world implicit feedback. A
noisy positive example could be interacted but it actually leads to negative
user preference. A noisy negative example which is uninteracted because of
unawareness of the user could also denote potential positive user preference.
Conventional training methods overlook these noisy examples, leading to
sub-optimal recommendation. In this work, we propose probabilistic and
variational recommendation denoising for implicit feedback. Through an
empirical study, we find that different models make relatively similar
predictions on clean examples which denote the real user preference, while the
predictions on noisy examples vary much more across different models. Motivated
by this observation, we propose denoising with probabilistic inference (DPI)
which aims to minimize the KL-divergence between the real user preference
distributions parameterized by two recommendation models while maximize the
likelihood of data observation. We then show that DPI recovers the evidence
lower bound of an variational auto-encoder when the real user preference is
considered as the latent variables. This leads to our second learning framework
denoising with variational autoencoder (DVAE). We employ the proposed DPI and
DVAE on four state-of-the-art recommendation models and conduct experiments on
three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that DPI and DVAE
significantly improve recommendation performance compared with normal training
and other denoising methods. Codes will be open-sourced.]]></summary>

abstract syntactic information present in these sentences in a manner that is
consistent with the grammar of English, or do they rely solely on a set of
heuristics? We propose a method to tackle this question, AlterRep. For any
linguistic feature in the sentence, AlterRep allows us to generate
counterfactual representations by altering how this feature is encoded, while
leaving all other aspects of the original representation intact. Then, by
measuring the change in a models' word prediction with these counterfactual
representations in different sentences, we can draw causal conclusions about
the contexts in which the model uses the linguistic feature (if any). Applying
this method to study how BERT uses relative clause (RC) span information, we
found that BERT uses information about RC spans during agreement prediction
using the linguistically correct strategy. We also found that counterfactual
representations generated for a specific RC subtype influenced the number
prediction in sentences with other RC subtypes, suggesting that information
about RC boundaries was encoded abstractly in BERT's representation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Error correction techniques have been used to refine the output sentences
from automatic speech recognition (ASR) models and achieve a lower word error
rate (WER) than original ASR outputs. Previous works usually use a
sequence-to-sequence model to correct an ASR output sentence autoregressively,
which causes large latency and cannot be deployed in online ASR services. A
straightforward solution to reduce latency, inspired by non-autoregressive
(NAR) neural machine translation, is to use an NAR sequence generation model
for ASR error correction, which, however, comes at the cost of significantly
increased ASR error rate. In this paper, observing distinctive error patterns
and correction operations (i.e., insertion, deletion, and substitution) in ASR,
we propose FastCorrect, a novel NAR error correction model based on edit
alignment. In training, FastCorrect aligns each source token from an ASR output
sentence to the target tokens from the corresponding ground-truth sentence
based on the edit distance between the source and target sentences, and
extracts the number of target tokens corresponding to each source token during
edition/correction, which is then used to train a length predictor and to
adjust the source tokens to match the length of the target sentence for
parallel generation. In inference, the token number predicted by the length
predictor is used to adjust the source tokens for target sequence generation.
Experiments on the public AISHELL-1 dataset and an internal industrial-scale
ASR dataset show the effectiveness of FastCorrect for ASR error correction: 1)
it speeds up the inference by 6-9 times and maintains the accuracy (8-14% WER
reduction) compared with the autoregressive correction model; and 2) it
outperforms the accuracy of popular NAR models adopted in neural machine
translation by a large margin.]]></summary>

knowledge regarding facts or common sense. However, because no model is

confidence, the answer to a particular query?" We examine this question from
the point of view of calibration, the property of a probabilistic model's
predicted probabilities actually being well correlated with the probabilities
of correctness. We examine three strong generative models -- T5, BART, and
GPT-2 -- and study whether their probabilities on QA tasks are well calibrated,
finding the answer is a relatively emphatic no. We then examine methods to
calibrate such models to make their confidence scores correlate better with the
likelihood of correctness through fine-tuning, post-hoc probability
modification, or adjustment of the predicted outputs or inputs. Experiments on
a diverse range of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. We
also perform analysis to study the strengths and limitations of these methods,
shedding light on further improvements that may be made in methods for
calibrating LMs. We have released the code at

multi-modal tasks, and cannot effectively adapt to each other. They can only
utilize single-modal data (i.e. text or image) or limited multi-modal data

is leveraged to align the textual and visual information into a unified

single-modal data is very rich, our model can utilize much larger scale of data
to learn more generalizable representations. Moreover, the textual knowledge
and visual knowledge can enhance each other in the unified semantic space. The

finite means to express an unlimited array of thoughts}. Of particular interest
is the aspect of compositionality, whereby, the meaning of a compound language
expression can be deduced from the meaning of its constituent parts. If
artificial agents can develop compositional communication protocols akin to
human language, they can be made to seamlessly generalize to unseen
combinations. However, the real question is, how do we induce compositionality
in emergent communication? Studies have recognized the role of curiosity in
enabling linguistic development in children. It is this same intrinsic urge
that drives us to master complex tasks with decreasing amounts of explicit
reward. In this paper, we seek to use this intrinsic feedback in inducing a
systematic and unambiguous protolanguage in artificial agents. We show how
these rewards can be leveraged in training agents to induce compositionality in
absence of any external feedback. Additionally, we introduce gComm, an
environment for investigating grounded language acquisition in 2D-grid
environments. Using this, we demonstrate how compositionality can enable agents
to not only interact with unseen objects but also transfer skills from one task
to another in a zero-shot setting: \textit{Can an agent, trained to `pull' and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While programming is one of the most broadly applicable skills in modern
society, modern machine learning models still cannot code solutions to basic
problems. It can be difficult to accurately assess code generation performance,
and there has been surprisingly little work on evaluating code generation in a
way that is both flexible and rigorous. To meet this challenge, we introduce
APPS, a benchmark for code generation. Unlike prior work in more restricted
settings, our benchmark measures the ability of models to take an arbitrary
natural language specification and generate Python code fulfilling this
specification. Similar to how companies assess candidate software developers,
we then evaluate models by checking their generated code on test cases. Our
benchmark includes 10,000 problems, which range from having simple one-line
solutions to being substantial algorithmic challenges. We fine-tune large
language models on both GitHub and our training set, and we find that the
prevalence of syntax errors is decreasing exponentially. Recent models such as
GPT-Neo can pass approximately 15% of the test cases of introductory problems,
so we find that machine learning models are beginning to learn how to code. As
the social significance of automatic code generation increases over the coming
years, our benchmark can provide an important measure for tracking
advancements.]]></summary>

beginning to influence computer vision architectures. Training very large
transformer models allowed significant improvement in both fields, but once
trained, these networks show symptoms of over-parameterization. For instance,
it is known that many attention heads can be pruned without impacting accuracy.
This work aims to enhance current understanding on how multiple heads interact.
Motivated by the observation that attention heads learn redundant key/query
projections, we propose a collaborative multi-head attention layer that enables
heads to learn shared projections. Our scheme decreases the number of
parameters in an attention layer and can be used as a drop-in replacement in
any transformer architecture. Our experiments confirm that sharing key/query
dimensions can be exploited in language understanding, machine translation and
vision. We also show that it is possible to re-parametrize a pre-trained
multi-head attention layer into our collaborative attention layer.
Collaborative multi-head attention reduces the size of the key and query
projections by 4 for same accuracy and speed. Our code is public.]]></summary>

In this work, we introduced UmlsBERT, a contextual embedding model that

UmlsBERT with the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus was
performed in two ways: i) connecting words that have the same underlying
`concept' in UMLS, and ii) leveraging semantic group knowledge in UMLS to
create clinically meaningful input embeddings. By applying these two

a supervised classification task. While in research settings, training and test
datasets are usually obtained from similar data samples, in practice systems
are often applied on data that are different from the training set in topic and

task aggravates the discrepancies between source and target datasets. We
explore the topic bias and the task formulation bias in cross-dataset

are biased towards platform-specific topics. We identify these examples using
unsupervised topic modeling and manual inspection of topics' keywords. Removing
these topics increases cross-dataset generalization, without reducing in-domain

inexpensive unsupervised methods to inspect the collected data and downsize the

we introduce an approach, Mondegreen, to correct voice queries in text space
without depending on audio signals, which may not always be available due to
system constraints or privacy or bandwidth (for example, some ASR systems run
on-device) considerations. We focus on voice queries transcribed via several
proprietary commercial ASR systems. These queries come from users making
internet, or online service search queries. We first present an analysis
showing how different the language distribution coming from user voice queries
is from that in traditional text corpora used to train off-the-shelf ASR
systems. We then demonstrate that Mondegreen can achieve significant
improvements in increased user interaction by correcting user voice queries in
one of the largest search systems in Google. Finally, we see Mondegreen as
complementing existing highly-optimized production ASR systems, which may not

is trained to ask questions corresponding to some input text. Most recent
approaches frame QG as a sequence-to-sequence problem and rely on additional
features and mechanisms to increase performance; however, these often increase
model complexity, and can rely on auxiliary data unavailable in practical use.
A single Transformer-based unidirectional language model leveraging transfer
learning can be used to produce high quality questions while disposing of
additional task-specific complexity. Our QG model, finetuned from GPT-2 Small,
outperforms several paragraph-level QG baselines on the SQuAD dataset by 0.95
METEOR points. Human evaluators rated questions as easy to answer, relevant to
their context paragraph, and corresponding well to natural human speech. Also
introduced is a new set of baseline scores on the RACE dataset, which has not
previously been used for QG tasks. Further experimentation with varying model
capacities and datasets with non-identification type questions is recommended
in order to further verify the robustness of pretrained Transformer-based LMs
as question generators.]]></summary>

document re-ranking involves utilizing large pre-trained language models -
e.g., BERT - to evaluate all individual passages in the document and then
aggregating the outputs by pooling or additional Transformer layers. A major
drawback of this approach is high query latency due to the cost of evaluating
every passage in the document with BERT. To make matters worse, this high
inference cost and latency varies based on the length of the document, with
longer documents requiring more time and computation. To address this
challenge, we adopt an intra-document cascading strategy, which prunes passages
of a candidate document using a less expensive model, called ESM, before
running a scoring model that is more expensive and effective, called ETM. We
found it best to train ESM (short for Efficient Student Model) via knowledge
distillation from the ETM (short for Effective Teacher Model) e.g., BERT. This
pruning allows us to only run the ETM model on a smaller set of passages whose
size does not vary by document length. Our experiments on the MS MARCO and TREC
Deep Learning Track benchmarks suggest that the proposed Intra-Document
Cascaded Ranking Model (IDCM) leads to over 400% lower query latency by
providing essentially the same effectiveness as the state-of-the-art BERT-based

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Constituent and dependency parsing, the two classic forms of syntactic
parsing, have been found to benefit from joint training and decoding under a
uniform formalism, Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG). However,
decoding this unified grammar has a higher time complexity ($O(n^5)$) than
decoding either form individually ($O(n^3)$) since more factors have to be
considered during decoding. We thus propose an improved head scorer that helps
achieve a novel performance-preserved parser in $O$($n^3$) time complexity.
Furthermore, on the basis of this proposed practical HPSG parser, we
investigated the strengths of HPSG-based parsing and explored the general
method of training an HPSG-based parser from only a constituent or dependency
annotations in a multilingual scenario. We thus present a more effective, more
in-depth, and general work on HPSG parsing.]]></summary>

is a collection of 8 Korean natural language understanding (NLU) tasks,
including Topic Classification, Semantic Textual Similarity, Natural Language
Inference, Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, Dependency Parsing,
Machine Reading Comprehension, and Dialogue State Tracking. We build all of the
tasks from scratch from diverse source corpora while respecting copyrights, to
ensure accessibility for anyone without any restrictions. With ethical
considerations in mind, we carefully design annotation protocols. Along with
the benchmark tasks and data, we provide suitable evaluation metrics and
fine-tuning recipes for pretrained language models for each task. We
furthermore release the pretrained language models (PLM), KLUE-BERT and
KLUE-RoBERTa, to help reproduce baseline models on KLUE and thereby facilitate
future research. We make a few interesting observations from the preliminary
experiments using the proposed KLUE benchmark suite, already demonstrating the
usefulness of this new benchmark suite. First, we find KLUE-RoBERTa-large
outperforms other baselines, including multilingual PLMs and existing
open-source Korean PLMs. Second, we see minimal degradation in performance even
when we replace personally identifiable information from the pretraining
corpus, suggesting that privacy and NLU capability are not at odds with each
other. Lastly, we find that using BPE tokenization in combination with
morpheme-level pre-tokenization is effective in tasks involving morpheme-level
tagging, detection and generation. In addition to accelerating Korean NLP
research, our comprehensive documentation on creating KLUE will facilitate
creating similar resources for other languages in the future. KLUE is available
at this https URL (https://klue-benchmark.com/).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Distantly supervised (DS) relation extraction (RE) has attracted much
attention in the past few years as it can utilize large-scale auto-labeled
data. However, its evaluation has long been a problem: previous works either
took costly and inconsistent methods to manually examine a small sample of
model predictions, or directly test models on auto-labeled data -- which, by
our check, produce as much as 53% wrong labels at the entity pair level in the
popular NYT10 dataset. This problem has not only led to inaccurate evaluation,
but also made it hard to understand where we are and what's left to improve in
the research of DS-RE. To evaluate DS-RE models in a more credible way, we
build manually-annotated test sets for two DS-RE datasets, NYT10 and Wiki20,
and thoroughly evaluate several competitive models, especially the latest
pre-trained ones. The experimental results show that the manual evaluation can
indicate very different conclusions from automatic ones, especially some
unexpected observations, e.g., pre-trained models can achieve dominating
performance while being more susceptible to false-positives compared to
previous methods. We hope that both our manual test sets and novel observations
can help advance future DS-RE research.]]></summary>

to strong classification performances in domains where authors tend to
explicitly express sentiment about specific entities or topics, such as in
reviews or on social media. We investigate TSC in news articles, a much less
researched domain, despite the importance of news as an essential information
source in individual and societal decision making. This article introduces
NewsTSC, a manually annotated dataset to explore TSC on news articles.
Investigating characteristics of sentiment in news and contrasting them to
popular TSC domains, we find that sentiment in the news is expressed less
explicitly, is more dependent on context and readership, and requires a greater
degree of interpretation. In an extensive evaluation, we find that the state of
the art in TSC performs worse on news articles than on other domains (average
recall AvgRec = 69.8 on NewsTSC compared to AvgRev = [75.6, 82.2] on
established TSC datasets). Reasons include incorrectly resolved relation of
target and sentiment-bearing phrases and off-context dependence. As a major
improvement over previous news TSC, we find that BERT's natural language
understanding capabilities capture the less explicit sentiment used in news
articles.]]></summary>

demonstrate that self-reflection can trigger a change in communication
behaviors, which lead to increased customer satisfaction. We illustrate and
test our approach analyzing e-mails of a large global services company by

satisfaction in the experimental group and a decrease in the control group

the individual communication indicators, we find that customer satisfaction is
higher when employees are more responsive, use a simpler language, are embedded

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Distributional semantics has deeply changed in the last decades. First,
predict models stole the thunder from traditional count ones, and more recently
both of them were replaced in many NLP applications by contextualized vectors
produced by Transformer neural language models. Although an extensive body of
research has been devoted to Distributional Semantic Model (DSM) evaluation, we
still lack a thorough comparison with respect to tested models, semantic tasks,
and benchmark datasets. Moreover, previous work has mostly focused on
task-driven evaluation, instead of exploring the differences between the way
models represent the lexical semantic space. In this paper, we perform a
comprehensive evaluation of type distributional vectors, either produced by
static DSMs or obtained by averaging the contextualized vectors generated by
BERT. First of all, we investigate the performance of embeddings in several
semantic tasks, carrying out an in-depth statistical analysis to identify the
major factors influencing the behavior of DSMs. The results show that i.) the
alleged superiority of predict based models is more apparent than real, and
surely not ubiquitous and ii.) static DSMs surpass contextualized
representations in most out-of-context semantic tasks and datasets.
Furthermore, we borrow from cognitive neuroscience the methodology of
Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to inspect the semantic spaces
generated by distributional models. RSA reveals important differences related
to the frequency and part-of-speech of lexical items.]]></summary>

clinical results, images, and textual descriptions of patient's health state.
All these data can be analyzed and employed to cater novel services that can
help people and domain experts with their common healthcare tasks. However,
many technologies such as Deep Learning and tools like Word Embeddings have
started to be investigated only recently, and many challenges remain open when
it comes to healthcare domain applications. To address these challenges, we
propose the use of Deep Learning and Word Embeddings for identifying sixteen
morbidity types within textual descriptions of clinical records. For this
purpose, we have used a Deep Learning model based on Bidirectional Long-Short
Term Memory (LSTM) layers which can exploit state-of-the-art vector
representations of data such as Word Embeddings. We have employed pre-trained
Word Embeddings namely GloVe and Word2Vec, and our own Word Embeddings trained
on the target domain. Furthermore, we have compared the performances of the
deep learning approaches against the traditional tf-idf using Support Vector
Machine and Multilayer perceptron (our baselines). From the obtained results it
seems that the latter outperforms the combination of Deep Learning approaches
using any word embeddings. Our preliminary results indicate that there are
specific features that make the dataset biased in favour of traditional machine
learning approaches.]]></summary>

psychotherapy, especially motivational interviewing. Previous work on
computational modelling of empathy in motivational interviewing has focused on
offline, session-level assessment of therapist empathy, where empathy captures
all efforts that the therapist makes to understand the client's perspective and
convey that understanding to the client. In this position paper, we propose a
novel task of turn-level detection of client need for empathy. Concretely, we
propose to leverage pre-trained language models and empathy-related general
conversation corpora in a unique labeller-detector framework, where the
labeller automatically annotates a motivational interviewing conversation
corpus with empathy labels to train the detector that determines the need for
therapist empathy. We also lay out our strategies of extending the detector
with additional-input and multi-task setups to improve its detection and

particularly in cross-sentence settings. The key to dealing with the problem is
to encode semantic information and model event inter-dependency at a
document-level. In this paper, we reformulate it as a Seq2Seq task and propose
a Multi-Layer Bidirectional Network (MLBiNet) to capture the document-level
association of events and semantic information simultaneously. Specifically, a
bidirectional decoder is firstly devised to model event inter-dependency within
a sentence when decoding the event tag vector sequence. Secondly, an
information aggregation module is employed to aggregate sentence-level semantic
and event tag information. Finally, we stack multiple bidirectional decoders
and feed cross-sentence information, forming a multi-layer bidirectional
tagging architecture to iteratively propagate information across sentences. We
show that our approach provides significant improvement in performance compared

English-centric directions, while the non-English directions still lag behind.
In this work, we aim to build a many-to-many translation system with an

based on the hypothesis that a universal cross-language representation leads to
better multilingual translation performance. To this end, we propose \method, a
training method to obtain a single unified multilingual translation model.
mCOLT is empowered by two techniques: (i) a contrastive learning scheme to
close the gap among representations of different languages, and (ii) data
augmentation on both multiple parallel and monolingual data to further align
token representations. For English-centric directions, mCOLT achieves
competitive or even better performance than a strong pre-trained model mBART on
tens of WMT benchmarks. For non-English directions, mCOLT achieves an
improvement of average 10+ BLEU compared with the multilingual baseline.]]></summary>

played key roles in a number of health related tasks. This paper presents, to

therefore, widely demanded by numerous Natural Language Processing
applications. In particular, left-to-right and top-down transition-based

top-down algorithm that Pointer Networks' sequential decoding can be improved
by implementing a hierarchical variant, more adequate to model dependency
structures. Considering all this, we develop a bottom-up-oriented Hierarchical
Pointer Network for the left-to-right parser and propose two novel
transition-based alternatives: an approach that parses a sentence in
right-to-left order and a variant that does it from the outside in. We
empirically test the proposed neural architecture with the different algorithms

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, abstractive text summarization with multimodal inputs has
started drawing attention due to its ability to accumulate information from
different source modalities and generate a fluent textual summary. However,
existing methods use short videos as the visual modality and short summary as
the ground-truth, therefore, perform poorly on lengthy videos and long
ground-truth summary. Additionally, there exists no benchmark dataset to
generalize this task on videos of varying lengths. In this paper, we introduce
AVIATE, the first large-scale dataset for abstractive text summarization with
videos of diverse duration, compiled from presentations in well-known academic
conferences like NDSS, ICML, NeurIPS, etc. We use the abstract of corresponding
research papers as the reference summaries, which ensure adequate quality and
uniformity of the ground-truth. We then propose {\name}, a factorized
multi-modal Transformer based decoder-only language model, which inherently
captures the intra-modal and inter-modal dynamics within various input
modalities for the text summarization task. {\name} utilizes an increasing
number of self-attentions to capture multimodality and performs significantly
better than traditional encoder-decoder based networks. Extensive experiments
illustrate that {\name} achieves significant improvement over the baselines in
both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the existing How2 dataset for
short videos and newly introduced AVIATE dataset for videos with diverse
duration, beating the best baseline on the two datasets by $1.39$ and $2.74$

single user response (a comment or a relevant article) to capture evidence have
shown remarkable success in interpretable claim verification. Owing to
different single responses convey different cognition of individual users
(i.e., audiences), the captured evidence belongs to the perspective of
individual cognition. However, individuals' cognition of social things is not
always able to truly reflect the objective. There may be one-sided or biased
semantics in their opinions on a claim. The captured evidence correspondingly
contains some unobjective and biased evidence fragments, deteriorating task
performance. In this paper, we propose a Dual-view model based on the views of
Collective and Individual Cognition (CICD) for interpretable claim
verification. From the view of the collective cognition, we not only capture
the word-level semantics based on individual users, but also focus on
sentence-level semantics (i.e., the overall responses) among all users and
adjust the proportion between them to generate global evidence. From the view
of individual cognition, we select the top-$k$ articles with high degree of
difference and interact with the claim to explore the local key evidence
fragments. To weaken the bias of individual cognition-view evidence, we devise
inconsistent loss to suppress the divergence between global and local evidence
for strengthening the consistent shared evidence between the both. Experiments
on three benchmark datasets confirm that CICD achieves state-of-the-art
performance.]]></summary>

a comprehensive survey of deep learning based developments in the past decade
