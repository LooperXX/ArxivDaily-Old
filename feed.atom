plant biodiversity research. This, however, is currently still being done
manually by botanists in the field. This work is very laborious, and the data
obtained is, though following a standardized method to estimate plant coverage,
usually subjective and has a coarse temporal resolution. To remedy these
caveats, we investigate approaches using convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
to automatically extract the relevant data from images, focusing on plant
community composition and species coverages of 9 herbaceous plant species. To
this end, we investigate several standard CNN architectures and different
pretraining methods. We find that we outperform our previous approach at higher
image resolutions using a custom CNN with a mean absolute error of 5.16%. In
addition to these investigations, we also conduct an error analysis based on
the temporal aspect of the plant cover images. This analysis gives insight into
where problems for automatic approaches lie, like occlusion and likely
misclassifications caused by temporal changes.]]></summary>

against repetitive patterns and featureless regions in the imagery. In such
cases, state-of-the-art image stitching methods easily produce image alignment
artifacts, since they may produce false pairwise image registrations that are
in conflict within the global connectivity graph. Our method augments the
current methods by collecting all the plausible pairwise image registration
candidates, among which globally consistent candidates are chosen. This enables
the stitching process to determine the correct pairwise registrations by
utilizing all the available information from the whole imagery, such as
unambiguous registrations outside the repeating pattern and featureless
regions. We formalize the method as a weighted multigraph whose nodes represent
the individual image transformations from the composite image, and whose sets
of multiple edges between two nodes represent all the plausible transformations
between the pixel coordinates of the two images. The edge weights represent the
plausibility of the transformations. The image transformations and the edge
weights are solved from a non-linear minimization problem with linear
constraints, for which a projection method is used. As an example, we apply the
method in a large-scale scanning application where the transformations are
primarily translations with only slight rotation and scaling component. Despite
these simplifications, the state-of-the-art methods do not produce adequate
results in such applications, since the image overlap is small, which can be
featureless or repetitive, and misalignment artifacts and their concealment are
unacceptable.]]></summary>

Non-Maxima Suppression (NMS) in bounding box post-processing in object
detection. It overcomes the inherent limitations of IoU-based NMS variants to
provide a more stable, consistent predictor of bounding box clustering by using
a normalized Manhattan Distance inspired proximity metric to represent bounding
box clustering. Unlike Greedy and Soft NMS, it does not rely solely on
classification confidence scores to select optimal bounding boxes, instead
selecting the box which is closest to every other box within a given cluster
and removing highly confluent neighboring boxes. Confluence is experimentally
validated on the MS COCO and CrowdHuman benchmarks, improving Average Precision
by up to 2.3-3.8% and Average Recall by up to 5.3-7.2% when compared against
de-facto standard and state of the art NMS variants. Quantitative results are
supported by extensive qualitative analysis and threshold sensitivity analysis
experiments support the conclusion that Confluence is more robust than NMS
variants. Confluence represents a paradigm shift in bounding box processing,
with potential to replace IoU in bounding box regression processes.]]></summary>

decision-makers, it becomes critical to communicate the uncertainty associated
with these model predictions. However, the majority of work on uncertainty has
focused on traditional probabilistic or ranking approaches - where the model
assigns low probabilities or scores to uncertain examples. While this captures
what examples are challenging for the model, it does not capture the underlying
source of the uncertainty. In this work, we seek to identify examples the model
is uncertain about and characterize the source of said uncertainty. We explore
the benefits of designing a targeted intervention - targeted data augmentation
of the examples where the model is uncertain over the course of training. We
investigate whether the rate of learning in the presence of additional

this is indeed the case, suggesting that well-designed interventions over the

requires generating large amounts of robot-specific data. Could we leverage
data previously collected on another robot to reduce or even completely remove
this need for robot-specific data? We propose a "robot-aware" solution paradigm
that exploits readily available robot "self-knowledge" such as proprioception,
kinematics, and camera calibration to achieve this. First, we learn modular
dynamics models that pair a transferable, robot-agnostic world dynamics module
with a robot-specific, analytical robot dynamics module. Next, we set up visual
planning costs that draw a distinction between the robot self and the world.
Our experiments on tabletop manipulation tasks in simulation and on real robots
demonstrate that these plug-in improvements dramatically boost the
transferability of visuomotor controllers, even permitting zero-shot transfer
onto new robots for the very first time. Project website:

(variance). The proposed bias detection method uncovers smallest systematic
errors and thereby reveals imperfections of the calibration setup and provides
the basis for camera model selection. A novel resampling-based uncertainty
estimator enables uncertainty estimation under non-ideal conditions and thereby
extends the classical covariance estimator. Furthermore, we derive a simple
uncertainty metric that is independent of the camera model. In combination, the

theoretical and empirical analysis of the conventional adversarial UDA methods

alternative optimization scheme for adversarial UDA. Specifically, we infer the

numerous tasks such as material science, chemistry and drug designs. Recent
researches abstract molecules as attributed graphs and employ graph neural
networks (GNN) for molecular representation learning, which have made
remarkable achievements in molecular graph modeling. Albeit powerful, current
models either are based on local aggregation operations and thus miss
higher-order graph properties or focus on only node information without fully

Passing Transformer (CoMPT) neural network to improve the molecular graph
representation by reinforcing message interactions between nodes and edges
based on the Transformer architecture. Unlike the previous transformer-style
GNNs that treat molecules as fully connected graphs, we introduce a message
diffusion mechanism to leverage the graph connectivity inductive bias and
reduce the message enrichment explosion. Extensive experiments demonstrated
that the proposed model obtained superior performances (around 4$\%$ on

organelles such as mitochondria, providing insights for clinical and scientific
studies. In recent years, a number of novel deep learning architectures have
been published reporting superior performance, or even human-level accuracy,
compared to previous approaches on public mitochondria segmentation datasets.
Unfortunately, many of these publications do not make neither the code nor the
full training details public to support the results obtained, leading to
reproducibility issues and dubious model comparisons. For that reason, and
following a recent code of best practices for reporting experimental results,
we present an extensive study of the state-of-the-art deep learning
architectures for the segmentation of mitochondria on EM volumes, and evaluate
the impact in performance of different variations of 2D and 3D U-Net-like
models for this task. To better understand the contribution of each component,
a common set of pre- and post-processing operations has been implemented and
tested with each approach. Moreover, an exhaustive sweep of hyperparameters
values for all architectures have been performed and each configuration has
been run multiple times to report the mean and standard deviation values of the
evaluation metrics. Using this methodology, we found very stable architectures
and hyperparameter configurations that consistently obtain state-of-the-art
results in the well-known EPFL Hippocampus mitochondria segmentation dataset.
Furthermore, we have benchmarked our proposed models on two other available
datasets, Lucchi++ and Kasthuri++, where they outperform all previous works.
The code derived from this research and its documentation are publicly

human speech into raw acoustic data? This paper proposes two neural network
architectures for modeling unsupervised lexical learning from raw acoustic
inputs, ciwGAN (Categorical InfoWaveGAN) and fiwGAN (Featural InfoWaveGAN),
that combine a Deep Convolutional GAN architecture for audio data (WaveGAN;
arXiv:1705.07904) with an information theoretic extension of GAN -- InfoGAN
(arXiv:1606.03657), and propose a new latent space structure that can model
featural learning simultaneously with a higher level classification and allows
for a very low-dimension vector representation of lexical items. Lexical
learning is modeled as emergent from an architecture that forces a deep neural
network to output data such that unique information is retrievable from its
acoustic outputs. The networks trained on lexical items from TIMIT learn to
encode unique information corresponding to lexical items in the form of
categorical variables in their latent space. By manipulating these variables,
the network outputs specific lexical items. The network occasionally outputs
innovative lexical items that violate training data, but are linguistically
interpretable and highly informative for cognitive modeling and neural network
interpretability. Innovative outputs suggest that phonetic and phonological
representations learned by the network can be productively recombined and
directly paralleled to productivity in human speech: a fiwGAN network trained
on `suit' and `dark' outputs innovative `start', even though it never saw
`start' or even a [st] sequence in the training data. We also argue that
setting latent featural codes to values well beyond training range results in
almost categorical generation of prototypical lexical items and reveals
underlying values of each latent code.]]></summary>

damages, and uprooting communities, ecosystems and economies. Accurate and
robust flood detection including delineating open water flood areas and
identifying flood levels can aid in disaster response and mitigation. However,
estimating flood levels remotely is of essence as physical access to flooded
areas is limited and the ability to deploy instruments in potential flood zones
can be dangerous. Aligning flood extent mapping with local topography can
provide a plan-of-action that the disaster response team can consider. Thus,
remote flood level estimation via satellites like Sentinel-1 can prove to be
remedial. The Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence (ETCI)
competition on Flood Detection tasked participants with predicting flooded
pixels after training with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images in a
supervised setting. We use a cyclical approach involving two stages (1)
training an ensemble model of multiple UNet architectures with available high
and low confidence labeled data and, (2) generating pseudo labels or low
confidence labels on the unlabeled test dataset, and then, combining the
generated labels with the previously available high confidence labeled dataset.
This assimilated dataset is used for the next round of training ensemble
models. This cyclical process is repeated until the performance improvement
plateaus. Additionally, we post process our results with Conditional Random
Fields. Our approach sets a high score on the public leaderboard for the ETCI
competition with 0.7654 IoU. Our method, which we release with all the code
including trained models, can also be used as an open science benchmark for the
Sentinel-1 released dataset on GitHub. To the best of our knowledge we believe
this the first works to try out semi-supervised learning to improve flood
segmentation models.]]></summary>

midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to inform decision-makers of future
demand and assess the societal value of possible interventions. For broad
applicability, we focus on the common yet challenging scenario where
patient-level data for a region of interest are not available. Instead, given
daily admissions counts, we model aggregated counts of observed resource use,
such as the number of patients in the general ward, in the intensive care unit,
or on a ventilator. In order to explain how individual patient trajectories
produce these counts, we propose an aggregate count explicit-duration hidden
Markov model, nicknamed the ACED-HMM, with an interpretable, compact
parameterization. We develop an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach that
draws samples from the posterior distribution over the model's transition and
duration parameters given aggregate counts from a specific location, thus
adapting the model to a region or individual hospital site of interest. Samples
from this posterior can then be used to produce future forecasts of any counts
of interest. Using data from the United States and the United Kingdom, we show
our mechanistic approach provides competitive probabilistic forecasts for the
future even as the dynamics of the pandemic shift. Furthermore, we show how our
model provides insight about recovery probabilities or length of stay
distributions, and we suggest its potential to answer challenging what-if
questions about the societal value of possible interventions.]]></summary>

of recovering, given two graphs, a one-to-one mapping between nodes that
maximizes edge overlap. This problem can be viewed as a noisy version of the
well-known graph isomorphism problem and appears in many applications,
including social network deanonymization and cellular biology. Our focus here
is on partial recovery, i.e., we look for a one-to-one mapping which is correct
on a fraction of the nodes of the graph rather than on all of them, and we
assume that the two input graphs to the problem are correlated
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs of parameters $(n,q,s)$. Our main contribution is then
to give necessary and sufficient conditions on $(n,q,s)$ under which partial
recovery is possible with high probability as the number of nodes $n$ goes to
infinity. In particular, we show that it is possible to achieve partial
recovery in the $nqs=\Theta(1)$ regime under certain additional assumptions. An
interesting byproduct of the analysis techniques we develop to obtain the
sufficiency result in the partial recovery setting is a tighter analysis of the
maximum likelihood estimator for the graph alignment problem, which leads to
improved sufficient conditions for exact recovery.]]></summary>

computational costs, usually requiring the use of thousands of GPUs and CPUs

model for global optimization of nonconvex functions on the sphere. This model
belongs to the class of Consensus-Based Optimization. In fact, particles move
on the sphere driven by a drift towards an instantaneous consensus point, which
is computed as a convex combination of particle locations, weighted by the cost
function according to Laplace's principle, and it represents an approximation
to a global minimizer. The dynamics is further perturbed by a random vector
field to favor exploration, whose variance is a function of the distance of the
particles to the consensus point. In particular, as soon as the consensus is
reached the stochastic component vanishes. The main results of this paper are
about the proof of convergence of the numerical scheme to global minimizers
provided conditions of well-preparation of the initial datum. The proof
combines previous results of mean-field limit with a novel asymptotic analysis,
and classical convergence results of numerical methods for SDE. We present
several numerical experiments, which show that the algorithm proposed in the
present paper scales well with the dimension and is extremely versatile. To
quantify the performances of the new approach, we show that the algorithm is
able to perform essentially as good as ad hoc state of the art methods in
challenging problems in signal processing and machine learning, namely the
phase retrieval problem and the robust subspace detection.]]></summary>

learning structures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have been
applied to solving a wide range of real-life problems. However, these
architectures are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose
for the first time to use hardware-supported approximate computing to improve
the robustness of machine learning classifiers. We show that our approximate
computing implementation achieves robustness across a wide range of attack
scenarios. Specifically, for black-box and grey-box attack scenarios, we show
that successful adversarial attacks against the exact classifier have poor
transferability to the approximate implementation. Surprisingly, the robustness
advantages also apply to white-box attacks where the attacker has access to the
internal implementation of the approximate classifier. We explain some of the
possible reasons for this robustness through analysis of the internal operation
of the approximate implementation. Furthermore, our approximate computing model
maintains the same level in terms of classification accuracy, does not require
retraining, and reduces resource utilization and energy consumption of the CNN.
We conducted extensive experiments on a set of strong adversarial attacks; We
empirically show that the proposed implementation increases the robustness of a
LeNet-5 and an Alexnet CNNs by up to 99% and 87%, respectively for strong
grey-box adversarial attacks along with up to 67% saving in energy consumption
due to the simpler nature of the approximate logic. We also show that a
white-box attack requires a remarkably higher noise budget to fool the
approximate classifier, causing an average of 4db degradation of the PSNR of
the input image relative to the images that succeed in fooling the exact
classifier]]></summary>

detection, we improve the AUROC from 85% (current SOTA) to more than 96% using
Vision Transformers pre-trained on ImageNet-21k. On a challenging genomics OOD

However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as
long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has
quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence
length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an
efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear
complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range
attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a
short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a
dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two
attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and
bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains,
including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and
ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on
enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being
faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its
full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the
state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained

algorithms for learning molecular representations have been proposed. Despite
the interest of the community in developing new methods for learning molecular
embeddings and their theoretical benefits, comparing molecular embeddings with
each other and with traditional representations is not straightforward, which
in turn hinders the process of choosing a suitable representation for QSAR
modeling. A reason behind this issue is the difficulty of conducting a fair and
thorough comparison of the different existing embedding approaches, which
requires numerous experiments on various datasets and training scenarios. To
close this gap, we reviewed the literature on methods for molecular embeddings
and reproduced three unsupervised and two supervised molecular embedding
techniques recently proposed in the literature. We compared these five methods
concerning their performance in QSAR scenarios using different classification
and regression datasets. We also compared these representations to traditional
molecular representations, namely molecular descriptors and fingerprints. As
opposed to the expected outcome, our experimental setup consisting of over
25,000 trained models and statistical tests revealed that the predictive
performance using molecular embeddings did not significantly surpass that of
traditional representations. While supervised embeddings yielded competitive
results compared to those using traditional molecular representations,
unsupervised embeddings tended to perform worse than traditional
representations. Our results highlight the need for conducting a careful
comparison and analysis of the different embedding techniques prior to using
them in drug design tasks, and motivate a discussion about the potential of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Machine unlearning is the task of updating machine learning (ML) models after
a subset of the training data they were trained on is deleted. Methods for the
task are desired to combine effectiveness and efficiency, i.e., they should
effectively "unlearn" deleted data, but in a way that does not require
excessive computation effort (e.g., a full retraining) for a small amount of
deletions. Such a combination is typically achieved by tolerating some amount
of approximation in the unlearning. In addition, laws and regulations in the
spirit of "the right to be forgotten" have given rise to requirements for
certifiability, i.e., the ability to demonstrate that the deleted data has
indeed been unlearned by the ML model.

In this paper, we present an experimental study of the three state-of-the-art
approximate unlearning methods for linear models and demonstrate the trade-offs
between efficiency, effectiveness and certifiability offered by each method. In
implementing the study, we extend some of the existing works and describe a
common ML pipeline to compare and evaluate the unlearning methods on six
real-world datasets and a variety of settings. We provide insights into the
effect of the quantity and distribution of the deleted data on ML models and
the performance of each unlearning method in different settings. We also
propose a practical online strategy to determine when the accumulated error
from approximate unlearning is large enough to warrant a full retrain of the ML
model.]]></summary>

records in computer vision. While drawing attention worldwide, the design of
the overall structure lacks general guidance. Based on the relationship between
DNN design and numerical differential equations, we performed a fair comparison
of the residual design with higher-order perspectives. We show that the widely
used DNN design strategy, constantly stacking a small design (usually 2-3
layers), could be easily improved, supported by solid theoretical knowledge and
with no extra parameters needed. We reorganise the residual design in
higher-order ways, which is inspired by the observation that many effective
networks can be interpreted as different numerical discretisations of
differential equations. The design of ResNet follows a relatively simple
scheme, which is Euler forward; however, the situation becomes complicated
rapidly while stacking. We suppose that stacked ResNet is somehow equalled to a
higher-order scheme; then, the current method of forwarding propagation might
be relatively weak compared with a typical high-order method such as
Runge-Kutta. We propose HO-ResNet to verify the hypothesis of widely used CV
benchmarks with sufficient experiments. Stable and noticeable increases in
performance are observed, and convergence and robustness are also improved. Our
stacking strategy improved ResNet-30 by 2.15 per cent and ResNet-58 by 2.35 per
cent on CIFAR-10, with the same settings and parameters. The proposed strategy
is fundamental and theoretical and can therefore be applied to any network as a
general guideline.]]></summary>

interaction data like views or clicks. This practice however raises serious
privacy concerns regarding the recommender's collection and handling of
potentially sensitive data. Several privacy-aware recommender systems have been
proposed in recent literature, but comparatively little attention has been
given to systems at the intersection of implicit feedback and privacy. To
address this shortcoming, we propose a practical federated recommender system
for implicit data under user-level local differential privacy (LDP). The
privacy-utility trade-off is controlled by parameters $\epsilon$ and $k$,
regulating the per-update privacy budget and the number of $\epsilon$-LDP
gradient updates sent by each user respectively. To further protect the user's
privacy, we introduce a proxy network to reduce the fingerprinting surface by
anonymizing and shuffling the reports before forwarding them to the
recommender. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on
the MovieLens dataset, achieving up to Hit Ratio with K=10 (HR@10) 0.68 on 50k
users with 5k items. Even on the full dataset, we show that it is possible to
achieve reasonable utility with HR@10>0.5 without compromising user privacy.]]></summary>

Neural Networks (SPINN) for solving ordinary and partial differential equations
(PDEs). By reinterpreting a traditional meshless representation of solutions of
PDEs we develop a class of sparse neural network architectures that are
partially interpretable. The SPINN model we propose here serves as a seamless
bridge between two extreme modeling tools for PDEs, namely dense neural network
based methods like Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and traditional
mesh-free numerical methods, thereby providing a novel means to develop a new
class of hybrid algorithms that build on the best of both these viewpoints. A
unique feature of the SPINN model that distinguishes it from other neural
network based approximations proposed earlier is that it is (i) interpretable,
in a particular sense made precise in the work, and (ii) sparse in the sense
that it has much fewer connections than typical dense neural networks used for
PDEs. Further, the SPINN algorithm implicitly encodes mesh adaptivity and is
able to handle discontinuities in the solutions. In addition, we demonstrate
that Fourier series representations can also be expressed as a special class of
SPINN and propose generalized neural network analogues of Fourier
representations. We illustrate the utility of the proposed method with a
variety of examples involving ordinary differential equations, elliptic,
parabolic, hyperbolic and nonlinear partial differential equations, and an
example in fluid dynamics.]]></summary>

tempered by concerns about its role in inflaming the 'culture wars'. Via mass
selection into like-minded groups, online society may be becoming more
fragmented and polarized, particularly with respect to partisan differences.
However, our ability to measure the social makeup of online communities, and in
turn understand the social organization of online platforms, is limited by the
pseudonymous, unstructured, and large-scale nature of digital discussion. We
develop a neural embedding methodology to quantify the positioning of online
communities along social dimensions by leveraging large-scale patterns of
aggregate behaviour. Applying our methodology to 5.1B Reddit comments made in
10K communities over 14 years, we measure how the macroscale community
structure is organized with respect to age, gender, and U.S. political
partisanship. Examining political content, we find Reddit underwent a
significant polarization event around the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and
remained highly polarized for years afterward. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
however, individual-level polarization is rare; the system-level shift in 2016
was disproportionately driven by the arrival of new and newly political users.
Political polarization on Reddit is unrelated to previous activity on the
platform, and is instead temporally aligned with external events. We also
observe a stark ideological asymmetry, with the sharp increase in 2016 being
entirely attributable to changes in right-wing activity. Our methodology is
broadly applicable to the study of online interaction, and our findings have
implications for the design of online platforms, understanding the social
contexts of online behaviour, and quantifying the dynamics and mechanisms of
online polarization.]]></summary>

level, there is a notable void. It is the ambition of this paper to fill this
gap. To this end, we develop a technique to forecast the entire process model
from historical event data. A forecasted model is a will-be process model
representing a probable future state of the overall process. Such a forecast
helps to investigate the consequences of drift and emerging bottlenecks. Our
technique builds on a representation of event data as multiple time series,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper argues that training GANs on local and non-local dependencies in
speech data offers insights into how deep neural networks discretize continuous
data and how symbolic-like rule-based morphophonological processes emerge in a
deep convolutional architecture. Acquisition of speech has recently been
modeled as a dependency between latent space and data generated by GANs in
Begu\v{s} (2020b; arXiv:2006.03965), who models learning of a simple local
allophonic distribution. We extend this approach to test learning of local and
non-local phonological processes that include approximations of morphological
processes. We further parallel outputs of the model to results of a behavioral
experiment where human subjects are trained on the data used for training the
GAN network. Four main conclusions emerge: (i) the networks provide useful
information for computational models of speech acquisition even if trained on a
comparatively small dataset of an artificial grammar learning experiment; (ii)
local processes are easier to learn than non-local processes, which matches
both behavioral data in human subjects and typology in the world's languages.
This paper also proposes (iii) how we can actively observe the network's
progress in learning and explore the effect of training steps on learning
representations by keeping latent space constant across different training
steps. Finally, this paper shows that (iv) the network learns to encode the
presence of a prefix with a single latent variable; by interpolating this
variable, we can actively observe the operation of a non-local phonological
process. The proposed technique for retrieving learning representations has
general implications for our understanding of how GANs discretize continuous
speech data and suggests that rule-like generalizations in the training data
are represented as an interaction between variables in the network's latent
space.]]></summary>

image generation using deep learning. Specifically, we explored a generative
adversarial network (GAN) model capable of generating high-resolution and

surface water estimation, river meandering, wetland loss, and other
hydrological research studies. First, we have created an extensive repository
of overhead river images to be used in training. Second, we incorporated the
Progressive Growing GAN (PGGAN), a network architecture that iteratively trains
smaller-resolution GANs to gradually build up to a very high resolution to
generate high quality (i.e., 1024x1024) synthetic river imagery. With simpler
GAN architectures, difficulties arose in terms of exponential increase of
training time and vanishing/exploding gradient issues, which the PGGAN
implementation seemed to significantly reduce. The results presented in this
study show great promise in generating high-quality images and capturing the

revealed that participants on average prefer the original biased system over
the debiased system. Specifically, we found that perceived gender disparity is

learning called INNA. It exploits the geometry of the loss function while only
requiring stochastic approximations of the function values and the generalized
gradients. This makes INNA fully implementable and adapted to large-scale
optimization problems such as the training of deep neural networks. The
algorithm combines both gradient-descent and Newton-like behaviors as well as
inertia. We prove the convergence of INNA for most deep learning problems. To
do so, we provide a well-suited framework to analyze deep learning loss
functions involving tame optimization in which we study a continuous dynamical
system together with its discrete stochastic approximations. We prove sublinear
convergence for the continuous-time differential inclusion which underlies our
algorithm. Additionally, we also show how standard optimization mini-batch
methods applied to non-smooth non-convex problems can yield a certain type of
spurious stationary points never discussed before. We address this issue by
providing a theoretical framework around the new idea of $D$-criticality; we
then give a simple asymptotic analysis of INNA. Our algorithm allows for using
an aggressive learning rate of $o(1/\log k)$. From an empirical viewpoint, we
show that INNA returns competitive results with respect to state of the art
(stochastic gradient descent, ADAGRAD, ADAM) on popular deep learning benchmark
problems.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Late blight disease is one of the most destructive diseases in potato crop,
leading to serious yield losses globally. Accurate diagnosis of the disease at
early stage is critical for precision disease control and management. Current
farm practices in crop disease diagnosis are based on manual visual inspection,
which is costly, time consuming, subject to individual bias. Recent advances in
imaging sensors (e.g. RGB, multiple spectral and hyperspectral cameras), remote
sensing and machine learning offer the opportunity to address this challenge.
Particularly, hyperspectral imagery (HSI) combining with machine learning/deep
learning approaches is preferable for accurately identifying specific plant
diseases because the HSI consists of a wide range of high-quality reflectance
information beyond human vision, capable of capturing both spectral-spatial
information. The proposed method considers the potential disease specific
reflectance radiation variance caused by the canopy structural diversity,
introduces the multiple capsule layers to model the hierarchical structure of
the spectral-spatial disease attributes with the encapsulated features to
represent the various classes and the rotation invariance of the disease
attributes in the feature space. We have evaluated the proposed method with the
real UAV-based HSI data under the controlled field conditions. The
effectiveness of the hierarchical features has been quantitatively assessed and
compared with the existing representative machine learning/deep learning
methods. The experiment results show that the proposed model significantly
improves the accuracy performance when considering hierarchical-structure of
spectral-spatial features, comparing to the existing methods only using
spectral, or spatial or spectral-spatial features without consider
hierarchical-structure of spectral-spatial features.]]></summary>

search is the evaluation of candidate models within a predefined search space.
In practice, a one-shot supernet is trained to serve as an evaluator. A
faithful ranking certainly leads to more accurate searching results. However,
current methods are prone to making misjudgments. In this paper, we prove that
their biased evaluation is due to inherent unfairness in the supernet training.
In view of this, we propose two levels of constraints: expectation fairness and
strict fairness. Particularly, strict fairness ensures equal optimization
opportunities for all choice blocks throughout the training, which neither
overestimates nor underestimates their capacity. We demonstrate that this is
crucial for improving the confidence of models' ranking. Incorporating the
one-shot supernet trained under the proposed fairness constraints with a
multi-objective evolutionary search algorithm, we obtain various
state-of-the-art models, e.g., FairNAS-A attains 77.5% top-1 validation
accuracy on ImageNet. The models and their evaluation codes are made publicly

and may limit the accuracy of these methods. In this paper we utilize saliency
maps to evaluate whether this correlation exists. Saliency maps reveal directly
how much a change in each input pixel would affect reconstruction loss, while
each pixel's reconstruction error may be attributed to many input pixels when
layers are fully connected. We compare saliency maps to reconstruction error
maps via qualitative visualizations as well as quantitative correspondence

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Though widely used in image classification, convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) are prone to noise interruptions, i.e. the CNN output can be drastically
changed by small image noise. To improve the noise robustness, we try to
integrate CNNs with wavelet by replacing the common down-sampling (max-pooling,
strided-convolution, and average pooling) with discrete wavelet transform
(DWT). We firstly propose general DWT and inverse DWT (IDWT) layers applicable
to various orthogonal and biorthogonal discrete wavelets like Haar, Daubechies,
and Cohen, etc., and then design wavelet integrated CNNs (WaveCNets) by
integrating DWT into the commonly used CNNs (VGG, ResNets, and DenseNet).
During the down-sampling, WaveCNets apply DWT to decompose the feature maps
into the low-frequency and high-frequency components. Containing the main
information including the basic object structures, the low-frequency component
is transmitted into the following layers to generate robust high-level
features. The high-frequency components are dropped to remove most of the data
noises. The experimental results show that %wavelet accelerates the CNN
training, and WaveCNets achieve higher accuracy on ImageNet than various
vanilla CNNs. We have also tested the performance of WaveCNets on the noisy
version of ImageNet, ImageNet-C and six adversarial attacks, the results
suggest that the proposed DWT/IDWT layers could provide better noise-robustness
and adversarial robustness. When applying WaveCNets as backbones, the
performance of object detectors (i.e., faster R-CNN and RetinaNet) on COCO
detection dataset are consistently improved. We believe that suppression of
aliasing effect, i.e. separation of low frequency and high frequency
information, is the main advantages of our approach. The code of our DWT/IDWT
layer and different WaveCNets are available at

adopted as the methodology of the experiment to obtain perceptual quality of
images. Additionally, we utilize some typical and frequently used objective
quality metrics to evaluate the coding methods in the experiment as comparison.
The experiment shows that CNN-based and GAN-based methods can perform better
than traditional methods in low bit-rates. In high bit-rates, however, it is
hard to verify whether CNN-based methods are superior to traditional methods.
Because the GAN method does not provide models with high target bit-rates, we
cannot exactly tell the performance of the GAN method in high bit-rates.
Furthermore, some popular objective quality metrics have not shown the ability
well to measure quality of images generated by learning-based coding methods,
especially the GAN-based one.]]></summary>

research topic recently. Existing 2D image-based virtual try-on methods aim to
transfer a target clothing image onto a reference person, which has two main
disadvantages: cannot control the size and length precisely; unable to
accurately estimate the user's figure in the case of users wearing thick
clothes, resulting in inaccurate dressing effect. In this paper, we put forward
an akin task that aims to dress clothing for underwear models. %, which is also
an urgent need in e-commerce scenarios. To solve the above drawbacks, we
propose a Shape Controllable Virtual Try-On Network (SC-VTON), where a graph
attention network integrates the information of model and clothing to generate
the warped clothing image. In addition, the control points are incorporated
into SC-VTON for the desired clothing shape. Furthermore, by adding a Splitting
Network and a Synthesis Network, we can use clothing/model pair data to help
optimize the deformation module and generalize the task to the typical virtual
try-on task. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can achieve
accurate shape control. Meanwhile, compared with other methods, our method can
generate high-resolution results with detailed textures.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Countless research works of deep neural networks (DNNs) in the task of credit
card fraud detection have focused on improving the accuracy of point
predictions and mitigating unwanted biases by building different network
architectures or learning models. Quantifying uncertainty accompanied by point
estimation is essential because it mitigates model unfairness and permits
practitioners to develop trustworthy systems which abstain from suboptimal
decisions due to low confidence. Explicitly, assessing uncertainties associated
with DNNs predictions is critical in real-world card fraud detection settings
for characteristic reasons, including (a) fraudsters constantly change their
strategies, and accordingly, DNNs encounter observations that are not generated
by the same process as the training distribution, (b) owing to the
time-consuming process, very few transactions are timely checked by
professional experts to update DNNs. Therefore, this study proposes three
uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques named Monte Carlo dropout, ensemble,
and ensemble Monte Carlo dropout for card fraud detection applied on
transaction data. Moreover, to evaluate the predictive uncertainty estimates,
UQ confusion matrix and several performance metrics are utilized. Through
experimental results, we show that the ensemble is more effective in capturing
uncertainty corresponding to generated predictions. Additionally, we
demonstrate that the proposed UQ methods provide extra insight to the point
predictions, leading to elevate the fraud prevention process.]]></summary>

function. Though costly to compute, the committor function encodes complete
mechanistic information of the processes involving rare events, including
reaction rates and transition-state ensembles. Under the framework of
transition path theory (TPT), recent work [1] proposes an algorithm where a
feedback loop couples a neural network that models the committor function with
importance sampling, mainly umbrella sampling, which collects data needed for
adaptive training. In this work, we show additional modifications are needed to
improve the accuracy of the algorithm. The first modification adds elements of
supervised learning, which allows the neural network to improve its prediction
by fitting to sample-mean estimates of committor values obtained from short
molecular dynamics trajectories. The second modification replaces the
committor-based umbrella sampling with the finite-temperature string (FTS)
method, which enables homogeneous sampling in regions where transition pathways
are located. We test our modifications on low-dimensional systems with
non-convex potential energy where reference solutions can be found via
analytical or the finite element methods, and show how combining supervised
learning and the FTS method yields accurate computation of committor functions
and reaction rates. We also provide an error analysis for algorithms that use
the FTS method, using which reaction rates can be accurately estimated during
training with a small number of samples.]]></summary>

samples to build an effective computational model. Labeling EEG data, on the
other hand, is often expensive and time-consuming. To tackle this problem and
reduce the need for output labels in the context of EEG-based emotion
recognition, we propose a semi-supervised pipeline to jointly exploit both
unlabeled and labeled data for learning EEG representations. Our
semi-supervised framework consists of both unsupervised and supervised
components. The unsupervised part maximizes the consistency between original

supervised part minimizes the cross-entropy between the input and output
labels. We evaluate our framework using both a stacked autoencoder and an
attention-based recurrent autoencoder. We test our framework on the large-scale
SEED EEG dataset and compare our results with several other popular
semi-supervised methods. Our semi-supervised framework with a deep
attention-based recurrent autoencoder consistently outperforms the benchmark
methods, even when small sub-sets (3\%, 5\% and 10\%) of the output labels are
available during training, achieving a new state-of-the-art semi-supervised
performance.]]></summary>

supervised paradigm is expensive and laborious due to its request for a large
number of images of dense crowd scenarios and their annotations. This paper
proposes a spatial uncertainty-aware semi-supervised approach via regularized
surrogate task (binary segmentation) for crowd counting problems. Different
from existing semi-supervised learning-based crowd counting methods, to exploit
the unlabeled data, our proposed spatial uncertainty-aware teacher-student
framework focuses on high confident regions' information while addressing the
noisy supervision from the unlabeled data in an end-to-end manner.
Specifically, we estimate the spatial uncertainty maps from the teacher model's
surrogate task to guide the feature learning of the main task (density
regression) and the surrogate task of the student model at the same time.
Besides, we introduce a simple yet effective differential transformation layer
to enforce the inherent spatial consistency regularization between the main
task and the surrogate task in the student model, which helps the surrogate
task to yield more reliable predictions and generates high-quality uncertainty
maps. Thus, our model can also address the task-level perturbation problems
that occur spatial inconsistency between the primary and surrogate tasks in the
student model. Experimental results on four challenging crowd counting datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance to the
state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods.]]></summary>

consensus on how they should do so, nor on a model for specifying a desired
driving behavior. We created a dataset to help address some of these questions
in a limited operating domain. The data consists of 92 traffic scenarios, with
multiple ways of traversing each scenario. Multiple annotators expressed their
preference between pairs of scenario traversals. We used the data to compare an
instance of a rulebook, carefully hand-crafted independently of the dataset,
with several interpretable machine learning models such as Bayesian networks,
decision trees, and logistic regression trained on the dataset. To compare
driving behavior, these models use scores indicating by how much different
scenario traversals violate each of 14 driving rules. The rules are
interpretable and designed by subject-matter experts. First, we found that
these rules were enough for these models to achieve a high classification
accuracy on the dataset. Second, we found that the rulebook provides high
interpretability without excessively sacrificing performance. Third, the data
pointed to possible improvements in the rulebook and the rules, and to
potential new rules. Fourth, we explored the interpretability vs performance
trade-off by also training non-interpretable models such as a random forest.
Finally, we make the dataset publicly available to encourage a discussion from
the wider community on behavior specification for AVs. Please find it at

with components for manipulation and navigation, where uncertainty over the
manipulation success drives exploration for the navigation controller, and the
manipulation module provides rewards for navigation. We evaluate our method on

activity, using non-invasive scalp electrodes. In this article, we propose the
Portiloop, a deep learning-based portable and low-cost device enabling the
neuroscience community to capture EEG, process it in real time, detect patterns
of interest, and respond with precisely-timed stimulation. The core of the
Portiloop is a System on Chip composed of an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)
and a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). After being converted to digital by
the ADC, the EEG signal is processed in the FPGA. The FPGA contains an ad-hoc
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with convolutional and recurrent units,
directly implemented in hardware. The output of the ANN is then used to trigger
the user-defined feedback. We use the Portiloop to develop a real-time sleep
spindle stimulating application, as a case study. Sleep spindles are a specific
type of transient oscillation ($\sim$2.5 s, 12-16 Hz) that are observed in EEG
recordings, and are related to memory consolidation during sleep. We tested the
Portiloop's capacity to detect and stimulate sleep spindles in real time using
an existing database of EEG sleep recordings. With 71% for both precision and
recall as compared with expert labels, the system is able to stimulate spindles
within $\sim$300 ms of their onset, enabling experimental manipulation of early
the entire spindle. The Portiloop can be extended to detect and stimulate other
neural events in EEG. It is fully available to the research community as an

in a much lower-dimensional space. One of the aims of dimension reduction is to
find intrinsic coordinates that describe the data manifold. The coordinates
returned by the embedding algorithm are abstract, and finding their physical or
domain-related meaning is not formalized and often left to domain experts. This
paper studies the problem of recovering the meaning of the new low-dimensional
representation in an automatic, principled fashion. We propose a method to
explain embedding coordinates of a manifold as non-linear compositions of
functions from a user-defined dictionary. We show that this problem can be set
up as a sparse linear Group Lasso recovery problem, find sufficient recovery

orthogonality constraint on one of the factor matrices, called the orthogonal
NMF (ONMF), has been found a promising clustering model and can outperform the
classical K-means. However, solving the ONMF model is a challenging
optimization problem because the coupling of the orthogonality and
non-negativity constraints introduces a mixed combinatorial aspect into the
problem due to the determination of the correct status of the variables
(positive or zero). Most of the existing methods directly deal with the
orthogonality constraint in its original form via various optimization
techniques, but are not scalable for large-scale problems. In this paper, we
propose a new ONMF based clustering formulation that equivalently transforms
the orthogonality constraint into a set of norm-based non-convex equality
constraints. We then apply a non-convex penalty (NCP) approach to add them to
the objective as penalty terms, leading to a problem that is efficiently
solvable. One smooth penalty formulation and one non-smooth penalty formulation
are respectively studied. We build theoretical conditions for the penalized
problems to provide feasible stationary solutions to the ONMF based clustering
problem, as well as proposing efficient algorithms for solving the penalized
problems of the two NCP methods. Experimental results based on both synthetic
and real datasets are presented to show that the proposed NCP methods are
computationally time efficient, and either match or outperform the existing
K-means and ONMF based methods in terms of the clustering performance.]]></summary>

inductive synthesis (CEGIS), the algorithms alternate between a synthesis phase

counterexamples. But what if a white-box oracle is either not available or not
easy to work with? We present a framework for solving a general class of
oracle-guided synthesis problems which we term synthesis modulo oracles. In
this setting, oracles may be black boxes with a query-response interface
defined by the synthesis problem. As a necessary component of this framework,
we also formalize the problem of satisfiability modulo theories and oracles,
and present an algorithm for solving this problem. We implement a prototype
solver for satisfiability and synthesis modulo oracles and demonstrate that, by
using oracles that execute functions not easily modeled in SMT-constraints,
such as recursive functions or oracles that incorporate compilation and
execution of code, SMTO and SyMO are able to solve problems beyond the

and inference times, which is crucial for training in resource constrained
environments or time critical inference applications. State-of-the-art (SOTA)
quantization approaches focus on post-training quantization, i.e. quantization
of pre-trained DNNs for speeding up inference. Very little work on quantized
training exists, which neither al-lows dynamic intra-epoch precision switches
nor em-ploys an information theory based switching heuristic. Usually, existing
approaches require full precision refinement afterwards and enforce a global
word length across the whole DNN. This leads to suboptimal quantization
mappings and resource usage. Recognizing these limits, we introduce MARViN, a
new quantized training strategy using information theory-based intra-epoch
precision switching, which decides on a per-layer basis which precision should
be used in order to minimize quantization-induced information loss. Note that
any quantization must leave enough precision such that future learning steps do
not suffer from vanishing gradients. We achieve an average speedup of 1.86
compared to a float32 basis while limiting mean accuracy degradation on
AlexNet/ResNet to only -0.075%.]]></summary>

are permutation-invariant. Absolute or relative positional embeddings are the
most popular ways to feed transformer models positional information. Absolute
positional embeddings are simple to implement, but suffer from generalization
issues when evaluating on sequences of different length than those seen at
training time. Relative positions are more robust to length change, but are
more complex to implement and yield inferior model throughput. In this paper,
we propose an augmentation-based approach (CAPE) for absolute positional
embeddings, which keeps the advantages of both absolute (simplicity and speed)
and relative position embeddings (better generalization). In addition, our
empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art models in machine translation, image

the parameters after every few iterations, train until either a human observer
or a simple metric-based heuristic decides the network isn't learning anymore,
and then backtrack and pick the saved parameters with the best validation
accuracy. Simple methods are used to determine if a neural network isn't
learning anymore because, as long as it's well after the optimal values are
found, the condition doesn't impact the final accuracy of the model. However
from a runtime perspective, this is of great significance to the many cases
where numerous neural networks are trained simultaneously (e.g. hyper-parameter
tuning). Motivated by this, we introduce a statistical significance test to
determine if a neural network has stopped learning. This stopping criterion
appears to represent a happy medium compared to other popular stopping
criterions, achieving comparable accuracy to the criterions that achieve the
highest final accuracies in 77% or fewer epochs, while the criterions which
stop sooner do so with an appreciable loss to final accuracy. Additionally, we
use this as the basis of a new learning rate scheduler, removing the need to
manually choose learning rate schedules and acting as a quasi-line search,
achieving superior or comparable empirical performance to existing methods.]]></summary>

investigate when and how such OOD generalization may be possible by evaluating
CNNs trained to classify both object category and 3D viewpoint on OOD

generalization. We show that increasing the number of in-distribution
combinations (ie. data diversity) substantially improves generalization to OOD
combinations, even with the same amount of training data. We compare learning
category and viewpoint in separate and shared network architectures, and
observe starkly different trends on in-distribution and OOD combinations, ie.
while shared networks are helpful in-distribution, separate networks
significantly outperform shared ones at OOD combinations. Finally, we
demonstrate that such OOD generalization is facilitated by the neural mechanism
of specialization, ie. the emergence of two types of neurons -- neurons
selective to category and invariant to viewpoint, and vice versa.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The geometric structure of an optimization landscape is argued to be
fundamentally important to support the success of deep neural network learning.
A direct computation of the landscape beyond two layers is hard. Therefore, to
capture the global view of the landscape, an interpretable model of the
network-parameter (or weight) space must be established. However, the model is
lacking so far. Furthermore, it remains unknown what the landscape looks like
for deep networks of binary synapses, which plays a key role in robust and
energy efficient neuromorphic computation. Here, we propose a statistical
mechanics framework by directly building a least structured model of the
high-dimensional weight space, considering realistic structured data,
stochastic gradient descent training, and the computational depth of neural
networks. We also consider whether the number of network parameters outnumbers
the number of supplied training data, namely, over- or under-parametrization.
Our least structured model reveals that the weight spaces of the
under-parametrization and over-parameterization cases belong to the same class,
in the sense that these weight spaces are well-connected without any
hierarchical clustering structure. In contrast, the shallow-network has a
broken weight space, characterized by a discontinuous phase transition, thereby
clarifying the benefit of depth in deep learning from the angle of high
dimensional geometry. Our effective model also reveals that inside a deep
network, there exists a liquid-like central part of the architecture in the
sense that the weights in this part behave as randomly as possible, providing
algorithmic implications. Our data-driven model thus provides a statistical
mechanics insight about why deep learning is unreasonably effective in terms of
the high-dimensional weight space, and how deep networks are different from
shallow ones.]]></summary>

learners to produce a complex and accurate model. From an optimization point of
view, the learning procedure of gradient boosting mimics a gradient descent on
a functional variable. This paper proposes to build upon the proximal point
algorithm, when the empirical risk to minimize is not differentiable, in order
to introduce a novel boosting approach, called proximal boosting. Besides being
motivated by non-differentiable optimization, the proposed algorithm benefits
from algorithmic improvements such as controlling the approximation error and
Nesterov's acceleration, in the same way as gradient boosting [Grubb and
Bagnell, 2011, Biau et al., 2018]. This leads to two variants, respectively
called residual proximal boosting and accelerated proximal boosting.
Theoretical convergence is proved for the first two procedures under different
hypotheses on the empirical risk and advantages of leveraging proximal methods
for boosting are illustrated by numerical experiments on simulated and
real-world data. In particular, we exhibit a favorable comparison over gradient
boosting regarding convergence rate and prediction accuracy.]]></summary>

common perception that getting more data is the key to achieving better machine
learning models from theoretical and practical perspectives. The paper sheds
some light on the shortcomings of using generic mathematical theories to
describe the process. It further highlights the need for theories specialized
in learning from data. While more data leverages the performance of machine
learning models in general, the relation in practice is shown to be logarithmic
at its best; After a specific limit, more data stabilize or degrade the machine
learning models. Recent work in reinforcement learning showed that the trend is
shifting away from data-oriented approaches and relying more on algorithms. The

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce the payload optimization method for federated recommender
systems (FRS). In federated learning (FL), the global model payload that is
moved between the server and users depends on the number of items to recommend.
The model payload grows when there is an increasing number of items. This
becomes challenging for an FRS if it is running in production mode. To tackle
the payload challenge, we formulated a multi-arm bandit solution that selected
part of the global model and transmitted it to all users. The selection process
was guided by a novel reward function suitable for FL systems. So far as we are
aware, this is the first optimization method that seeks to address item
dependent payloads. The method was evaluated using three benchmark
recommendation datasets. The empirical validation confirmed that the proposed
method outperforms the simpler methods that do not benefit from the bandits for
the purpose of item selection. In addition, we have demonstrated the usefulness
of our proposed method by rigorously evaluating the effects of a payload
reduction on the recommendation performance degradation. Our method achieved up
to a 90\% reduction in model payload, yielding only a $\sim$4\% - 8\% loss in
the recommendation performance for highly sparse datasets]]></summary>

image novelty detection and localization under the assumption that pixels with
high error indicate which parts of the input image are unfamiliar and therefore
likely to be novel. This assumed correlation between pixels with high
reconstruction error and novel regions of input images has not been verified
and may limit the accuracy of these methods. In this paper we utilize saliency
maps to evaluate whether this correlation exists. Saliency maps reveal directly
how much a change in each input pixel would affect reconstruction loss, while
each pixel's reconstruction error may be attributed to many input pixels when
layers are fully connected. We compare saliency maps to reconstruction error
maps via qualitative visualizations as well as quantitative correspondence
between the top K elements of the maps for both novel and normal images. Our
results indicate that reconstruction error maps do not closely correlate with
the importance of pixels in the input images, making them insufficient for
novelty localization.]]></summary>

leading to serious yield losses globally. Accurate diagnosis of the disease at
early stage is critical for precision disease control and management. Current
farm practices in crop disease diagnosis are based on manual visual inspection,
which is costly, time consuming, subject to individual bias. Recent advances in
imaging sensors (e.g. RGB, multiple spectral and hyperspectral cameras), remote
sensing and machine learning offer the opportunity to address this challenge.
Particularly, hyperspectral imagery (HSI) combining with machine learning/deep
learning approaches is preferable for accurately identifying specific plant
diseases because the HSI consists of a wide range of high-quality reflectance
information beyond human vision, capable of capturing both spectral-spatial
information. The proposed method considers the potential disease specific
reflectance radiation variance caused by the canopy structural diversity,
introduces the multiple capsule layers to model the hierarchical structure of
the spectral-spatial disease attributes with the encapsulated features to
represent the various classes and the rotation invariance of the disease
attributes in the feature space. We have evaluated the proposed method with the
real UAV-based HSI data under the controlled field conditions. The
effectiveness of the hierarchical features has been quantitatively assessed and
compared with the existing representative machine learning/deep learning
methods. The experiment results show that the proposed model significantly
improves the accuracy performance when considering hierarchical-structure of
spectral-spatial features, comparing to the existing methods only using
spectral, or spatial or spectral-spatial features without consider
hierarchical-structure of spectral-spatial features.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edge computing enabled smart greenhouse is a representative application of
Internet of Things technology, which can monitor the environmental information
in real time and employ the information to contribute to intelligent
decision-making. In the process, anomaly detection for wireless sensor data
plays an important role. However, traditional anomaly detection algorithms
originally designed for anomaly detection in static data have not properly
considered the inherent characteristics of data stream produced by wireless
sensor such as infiniteness, correlations and concept drift, which may pose a
considerable challenge on anomaly detection based on data stream, and lead to
low detection accuracy and efficiency. First, data stream usually generates
quickly which means that it is infinite and enormous, so any traditional
off-line anomaly detection algorithm that attempts to store the whole dataset
or to scan the dataset multiple times for anomaly detection will run out of
memory space. Second, there exist correlations among different data streams,
which traditional algorithms hardly consider. Third, the underlying data
generation process or data distribution may change over time. Thus, traditional
anomaly detection algorithms with no model update will lose their effects.
Considering these issues, a novel method (called DLSHiForest) on basis of
Locality-Sensitive Hashing and time window technique in this paper is proposed
to solve these problems while achieving accurate and efficient detection.
Comprehensive experiments are executed using real-world agricultural greenhouse
dataset to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Experimental results
show that our proposal is practicable in addressing challenges of traditional
anomaly detection while ensuring accuracy and efficiency.]]></summary>

an architecture and used to validate the prediction outcomes. In this paper, we
introduce "computational profiles" as vectors of neuron activation levels. We
investigate the distribution of computational profile likelihood of metamorphic
test cases with respect to the likelihood distributions of training, test and
error control cases. We estimate the non-parametric probability densities of
neuron activation levels for each distinct output class. Probabilities are
inferred using training cases only, without any additional knowledge about
metamorphic test cases. Experiments are performed by training a network on the
MNIST Fashion library of images and comparing prediction likelihoods with those
obtained from error control-data and from metamorphic test cases. Experimental
results show that the distributions of computational profile likelihood for
training and test cases are somehow similar, while the distribution of the
random-noise control-data is always remarkably lower than the observed one for
the training and testing sets. In contrast, metamorphic test cases show a
prediction likelihood that lies in an extended range with respect to training,
tests, and random noise. Moreover, the presented approach allows the
independent assessment of different training classes and experiments to show
that some of the classes are more sensitive to misclassifying metamorphic test
cases than other classes. In conclusion, metamorphic test cases represent very
aggressive tests for neural network architectures. Furthermore, since
metamorphic test cases force a network to misclassify those inputs whose
likelihood is similar to that of training cases, they could also be considered
as adversarial attacks that evade defenses based on computational profile
likelihood evaluation.]]></summary>

multiple languages using self-supervised learning (SSL) and applying these for
automatic speech recognition. There is an abundance of unannotated speech, so
creating self-supervised representations from raw audio and finetuning on a
small annotated datasets is a promising direction to build speech recognition
systems. Wav2vec models perform SSL on raw audio in a pretraining phase and
then finetune on a small fraction of annotated data. SSL models have produced
state of the art results for ASR. However, these models are very expensive to
pretrain with self-supervision. We tackle the problem of learning new language
representations continually from audio without forgetting a previous language
representation. We use ideas from continual learning to transfer knowledge from
a previous task to speed up pretraining a new language task. Our
continual-wav2vec2 model can decrease pretraining times by 32% when learning a
new language task, and learn this new audio-language representation without
forgetting previous language representation.]]></summary>

non-compliance by the participants. While much of the existing work has studied
compliance as a static behavior, we propose a game-theoretic model to study
compliance as dynamic behavior that may change over time. In rounds, a social
planner interacts with a sequence of heterogeneous agents who arrive with their
unobserved private type that determines both their prior preferences across the
actions (e.g., control and treatment) and their baseline rewards without taking
any treatment. The planner provides each agent with a randomized recommendation
that may alter their beliefs and their action selection. We develop a novel
recommendation mechanism that views the planner's recommendation as a form of
instrumental variable (IV) that only affects an agents' action selection, but
not the observed rewards. We construct such IVs by carefully mapping the
history -- the interactions between the planner and the previous agents -- to a
random recommendation. Even though the initial agents may be completely
non-compliant, our mechanism can incentivize compliance over time, thereby
enabling the estimation of the treatment effect of each treatment, and
minimizing the cumulative regret of the planner whose goal is to identify the
optimal treatment.]]></summary>

strong homophily property, i.e. connected nodes have the same labels. However,
they perform poorly on heterophilic graphs. Several approaches address the
issue of heterophily by proposing models that adapt the graph by optimizing
task-specific loss function using labelled data. These adaptations are made
either via attention or by attenuating or enhancing various
low-frequency/high-frequency signals, as needed for the task at hand. More
recent approaches adapt the eigenvalues of the graph. One important
interpretation of this adaptation is that these models select/weigh the
eigenvectors of the graph. Based on this interpretation, we present an
eigendecomposition based approach and propose EigenNetwork models that improve
the performance of GNNs on heterophilic graphs. Performance improvement is
achieved by learning flexible graph adaptation functions that modulate the
eigenvalues of the graph. Regularization of these functions via parameter
sharing helps to improve the performance even more. Our approach achieves up to

these are usually unavailable in binaries. Training a machine learning model to
predict function names automatically is promising but fundamentally hard due to
the enormous number of classes. In this paper, we introduce eXtreme Function
Labeling (XFL), an extreme multi-label learning approach to selecting
appropriate labels for binary functions. XFL splits function names into tokens,
treating each as an informative label akin to the problem of tagging texts in
natural language. To capture the semantics of binary code, we introduce DEXTER,
a novel function embedding that combines static analysis-based features with
local context from the call graph and global context from the entire binary. We
demonstrate that XFL outperforms state-of-the-art approaches to function
labeling on a dataset of over 10,000 binaries from the Debian project,
achieving a precision of 82.5%. We also study combinations of XFL with
different published embeddings for binary functions and show that DEXTER
consistently improves over the state of the art in information gain. As a
result, we are able to show that binary function labeling is best phrased in
terms of multi-label learning, and that binary function embeddings benefit from
moving beyond just learning from syntax.]]></summary>

prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. The prevailing studies
formulate arrhythmia detection from ECG as a time series classification
problem. Meanwhile, early detection of arrhythmia presents a real-world demand
for early prevention and diagnosis. In this paper, we address a problem of
cardiovascular disease early classification, which is a varied-length and
long-length time series early classification problem as well. For solving this
problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework, namely
Snippet Policy Network (SPN), consisting of four modules, snippet generator,
backbone network, controlling agent, and discriminator. Comparing to the
existing approaches, the proposed framework features flexible input length,
solves the dual-optimization solution of the earliness and accuracy goals.
Experimental results demonstrate that SPN achieves an excellent performance of
over 80\% in terms of accuracy. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, at
least 7% improvement on different metrics, including the precision, recall,
F1-score, and harmonic mean, is delivered by the proposed SPN. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work focusing on solving the cardiovascular
early classification problem based on varied-length ECG data. Based on these
excellent features from SPN, it offers a good exemplification for addressing
all kinds of varied-length time series early classification problems.]]></summary>

often form a dynamic network that depends on patient's modifiable risk factors
and their interaction with non-modifiable risk factors and existing conditions.
Continuous time Bayesian networks (CTBNs) are effective methods for modeling
the complex network of MCC relationships over time. However, CTBNs are not able
to effectively formulate the dynamic impact of patient's modifiable risk
factors on the emergence and progression of MCC. Considering a functional CTBN
(FCTBN) to represent the underlying structure of the MCC relationships with
respect to individuals' risk factors and existing conditions, we propose a
nonlinear state-space model based on Extended Kalman filter (EKF) to capture
the dynamics of the patients' modifiable risk factors and existing conditions
on the MCC evolution over time. We also develop a tensor control chart to
dynamically monitor the effect of changes in the modifiable risk factors of
individual patients on the risk of new chronic conditions emergence. We
validate the proposed approach based on a combination of simulation and real
data from a dataset of 385 patients from Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC)
over multiple years. The dataset examines the emergence of 5 chronic conditions
(Diabetes, Obesity, Cognitive Impairment, Hyperlipidemia, and Hypertension)
based on 4 modifiable risk factors representing lifestyle behaviors (Diet,
Exercise, Smoking Habit, and Drinking Habit) and 3 non-modifiable risk factors,
including demographic information (Age, Gender, Education). The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for dynamic
prediction and monitoring of the risk of MCC emergence in individual patients.]]></summary>

SARSCoV-2 coronavirus, which results in the novel coronavirus disease
(COVID-19), is transmitted through respiratory droplets or by contact. Contact
transmission occurs when contaminated hands touch the mucous membrane of the
mouth, nose, or eyes. Moreover, pathogens can also be transferred from one
surface to another by contaminated hands, which facilitates transmission by
indirect contact. Consequently, hands hygiene is extremely important to prevent
the spread of the SARSCoV-2 virus. Additionally, hand washing and/or hand
rubbing disrupts also the transmission of other viruses and bacteria that cause
common colds, flu and pneumonia, thereby reducing the overall disease burden.
The vast proliferation of wearable devices, such as smartwatches, containing
acceleration, rotation, magnetic field sensors, etc., together with the modern
technologies of artificial intelligence, such as machine learning and more
recently deep-learning, allow the development of accurate applications for
recognition and classification of human activities such as: walking, climbing
stairs, running, clapping, sitting, sleeping, etc. In this work we evaluate the
feasibility of an automatic system, based on current smartwatches, which is
able to recognize when a subject is washing or rubbing its hands, in order to
monitor parameters such as frequency and duration, and to evaluate the
effectiveness of the gesture. Our preliminary results show a classification
accuracy of about 95% and of about 94% for respectively deep and standard

volunteered geographic information. Although OSM includes various geographical
entities, their descriptions are highly heterogeneous, incomplete, and do not
follow any well-defined ontology. Knowledge graphs can potentially provide
valuable semantic information to enrich OSM entities. However, interlinking OSM
entities with knowledge graphs is inherently difficult due to the large,
heterogeneous, ambiguous, and flat OSM schema and the annotation sparsity. This
paper tackles the alignment of OSM tags with the corresponding knowledge graph
classes holistically by jointly considering the schema and instance layers. We
propose a novel neural architecture that capitalizes upon a shared latent space
for tag-to-class alignment created using linked entities in OSM and knowledge
graphs. Our experiments performed to align OSM datasets for several countries
with two of the most prominent openly available knowledge graphs, namely,
Wikidata and DBpedia, demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art schema alignment baselines by up to 53 percentage points in
terms of F1-score. The resulting alignment facilitates new semantic annotations
for over 10 million OSM entities worldwide, which is more than a 400% increase

networks with decision trees as one of the most commonly incorporated tools.
There are at least three advantages of using decision trees over logistic
regression classification models: they are easy to interpret since they are
based on binary decisions, they can make decisions faster, and they provide a
hierarchy of classes. However, one of the well-known drawbacks of decision
trees, as compared to decision graphs, is that decision trees cannot reuse the
decision nodes. Nevertheless, decision graphs were not commonly used in deep
learning due to the lack of efficient gradient-based training techniques. In
this paper, we fill this gap and provide a general paradigm based on Markov
processes, which allows for efficient training of the special type of decision
graphs, which we call Self-Organizing Neural Graphs (SONG). We provide an
extensive theoretical study of SONG, complemented by experiments conducted on
Letter, Connect4, MNIST, CIFAR, and TinyImageNet datasets, showing that our

anomalies in multi-sensor environments. A typical use includes training a
predictive model with data from sensors operating under normal conditions and
using the model to detect anomalies. Anomalies can come either from real
changes in the environment (real drift) or from faulty sensory devices (virtual
drift); however, the use of Autoencoders to distinguish between different
anomalies has not yet been considered. To this end, we first propose the
development of Bayesian Autoencoders to quantify epistemic and aleatoric
uncertainties. We then test the Bayesian Autoencoder using a real-world
industrial dataset for hydraulic condition monitoring. The system is injected
with noise and drifts, and we have found the epistemic uncertainty to be less
sensitive to sensor perturbations as compared to the reconstruction loss. By
observing the reconstructed signals with the uncertainties, we gain
interpretable insights, and these uncertainties offer a potential avenue for
distinguishing real and virtual drifts.]]></summary>

problems such as imbalanced learning and recommender systems. The vast majority
of existing AUC-optimization-based machine learning methods only focus on
binary-class cases, while leaving the multiclass cases unconsidered. In this
paper, we start an early trial to consider the problem of learning multiclass
scoring functions via optimizing multiclass AUC metrics. Our foundation is
based on the M metric, which is a well-known multiclass extension of AUC. We
first pay a revisit to this metric, showing that it could eliminate the
imbalance issue from the minority class pairs. Motivated by this, we propose an
empirical surrogate risk minimization framework to approximately optimize the M
metric. Theoretically, we show that: (i) optimizing most of the popular
differentiable surrogate losses suffices to reach the Bayes optimal scoring
function asymptotically; (ii) the training framework enjoys an imbalance-aware
generalization error bound, which pays more attention to the bottleneck samples
of minority classes compared with the traditional $O(\sqrt{1/N})$ result.
Practically, to deal with the low scalability of the computational operations,
we propose acceleration methods for three popular surrogate loss functions,
including the exponential loss, squared loss, and hinge loss, to speed up loss
and gradient evaluations. Finally, experimental results on 11 real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.]]></summary>

and crowd regulation. Spatial dependencies, temporal dependencies,
inter-station correlations driven by other latent factors, and exogenous
factors bring challenges to the short-term forecasts of passenger flow of urban
rail transit networks. An innovative deep learning approach, Multi-Graph
Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Network (MGC-RNN) is proposed to forecast
passenger flow in urban rail transit systems to incorporate these complex
factors. We propose to use multiple graphs to encode the spatial and other
heterogenous inter-station correlations. The temporal dynamics of the
inter-station correlations are also modeled via the proposed multi-graph
convolutional-recurrent neural network structure. Inflow and outflow of all
stations can be collectively predicted with multiple time steps ahead via a
sequence to sequence(seq2seq) architecture. The proposed method is applied to
the short-term forecasts of passenger flow in Shenzhen Metro, China. The
experimental results show that MGC-RNN outperforms the benchmark algorithms in
terms of forecasting accuracy. Besides, it is found that the inter-station
driven by network distance, network structure, and recent flow patterns are
significant factors for passenger flow forecasting. Moreover, the architecture
of LSTM-encoder-decoder can capture the temporal dependencies well. In general,
the proposed framework could provide multiple views of passenger flow dynamics
for fine prediction and exhibit a possibility for multi-source heterogeneous

nonlinear higher-order Markov chains in latent space. The conditional
independencies of the generative model enable us to parameterize only an
inference model, which learns to estimate clean states in a self-supervised
manner using maximum likelihood. First, we propose a recurrent method that is
trained directly on noisy observations. Afterward, we cast the model such that
the optimization problem leads to an update scheme that backpropagates through
a recursion similar to the classical Kalman filter and smoother. In scientific
applications, domain knowledge can give a linear approximation of the latent
transition maps. We can easily incorporate this knowledge into our model,
leading to a hybrid inference approach. In contrast to other methods,
experiments show that the hybrid method makes the inferred latent states
physically more interpretable and accurate, especially in low-data regimes.
Furthermore, we do not rely on an additional parameterization of the generative
model or supervision via uncorrupted observations or ground truth latent
states. Despite our model's simplicity, we obtain competitive results on the
chaotic Lorenz system compared to a fully supervised approach and outperform a
method based on variational inference.]]></summary>

encoders, i.e., encoders obtained by composing neural networks with symbolic
programs from a domain-specific language. Such a framework can naturally
incorporate symbolic expert knowledge into the learning process and lead to
more interpretable and factorized latent representations than fully neural
encoders. Also, models learned this way can have downstream impact, as many
analysis workflows can benefit from having clean programmatic descriptions. We
ground our learning algorithm in the variational autoencoding (VAE) framework,
where we aim to learn a neurosymbolic encoder in conjunction with a standard
decoder. Our algorithm integrates standard VAE-style training with modern
program synthesis techniques. We evaluate our method on learning latent
representations for real-world trajectory data from animal biology and sports

in various use cases in manufacturing. Most research focused on maximising
predictive accuracy without addressing the uncertainty associated with it.
While accuracy is important, focusing primarily on it poses an overfitting
danger, exposing manufacturers to risk, ultimately hindering the adoption of
these techniques. In this paper, we determine the sources of uncertainty in
machine learning and establish the success criteria of a machine learning
system to function well under uncertainty in a cyber-physical manufacturing
system (CPMS) scenario. Then, we propose a multi-agent system architecture
which leverages probabilistic machine learning as a means of achieving such
criteria. We propose possible scenarios for which our proposed architecture is
useful and discuss future work. Experimentally, we implement Bayesian Neural
Networks for multi-tasks classification on a public dataset for the real-time
condition monitoring of a hydraulic system and demonstrate the usefulness of
the system by evaluating the probability of a prediction being accurate given
its uncertainty. We deploy these models using our proposed agent-based
framework and integrate web visualisation to demonstrate its real-time
feasibility.]]></summary>

$p(y)$ is invariant across domains, and relies on aligning $p(x)$ as an
alternative to the $p(x|y)$ alignment. To address this, we provide a thorough
theoretical and empirical analysis of the conventional adversarial UDA methods

alternative optimization scheme for adversarial UDA. Specifically, we infer the

architectures of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for the tasks at hand. However,
one bottleneck of NAS is the prohibitively computational cost largely due to
the expensive performance evaluation. The neural predictors can directly
estimate the performance without any training of the DNNs to be evaluated, thus
have drawn increasing attention from researchers. Despite their popularity,
they also suffer a severe limitation: the shortage of annotated DNN
architectures for effectively training the neural predictors. In this paper, we
proposed Homogeneous Architecture Augmentation for Neural Predictor (HAAP) of
DNN architectures to address the issue aforementioned. Specifically, a
homogeneous architecture augmentation algorithm is proposed in HAAP to generate
sufficient training data taking the use of homogeneous representation.
Furthermore, the one-hot encoding strategy is introduced into HAAP to make the
representation of DNN architectures more effective. The experiments have been
conducted on both NAS-Benchmark-101 and NAS-Bench-201 dataset. The experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed HAAP algorithm outperforms the state of
the arts compared, yet with much less training data. In addition, the ablation

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Network automation is gaining significant attention in the development of B5G
networks, primarily for reducing operational complexity, expenditures and
improving network efficiency. Concurrently operating closed loops aiming for
individual optimization targets may cause conflicts which, left unresolved,
would lead to significant degradation in network Key Performance Indicators
(KPIs), thereby resulting in sub-optimal network performance. Centralized
coordination, albeit optimal, is impractical in large scale networks and for
time-critical applications. Decentralized approaches are therefore envisaged in
the evolution to B5G and subsequently, 6G networks. This work explores
pervasive intelligence for conflict resolution in network automation, as an
alternative to centralized orchestration. A Q-Learning decentralized approach
to network automation is proposed, and an application to network slice
auto-scaling is designed and evaluated. Preliminary results highlight the
potential of the proposed scheme and justify further research work in this
direction.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Collaborative filtering models based on matrix factorization and learned
similarities using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have gained significant
attention in recent years. This is, in part, because ANNs have demonstrated
good results in a wide variety of recommendation tasks. The introduction of
ANNs within the recommendation ecosystem has been recently questioned, raising
several comparisons in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. One aspect most
of these comparisons have in common is their focus on accuracy, neglecting
other evaluation dimensions important for the recommendation, such as novelty,
diversity, or accounting for biases. We replicate experiments from three papers
that compare Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) and Matrix Factorization
(MF), to extend the analysis to other evaluation dimensions. Our contribution
shows that the experiments are entirely reproducible, and we extend the study
including other accuracy metrics and two statistical hypothesis tests. We
investigated the Diversity and Novelty of the recommendations, showing that MF
provides a better accuracy also on the long tail, although NCF provides a
better item coverage and more diversified recommendations. We discuss the bias
effect generated by the tested methods. They show a relatively small bias, but
other recommendation baselines, with competitive accuracy performance,
consistently show to be less affected by this issue. This is the first work, to
the best of our knowledge, where several evaluation dimensions have been
explored for an array of SOTA algorithms covering recent adaptations of ANNs
and MF. Hence, we show the potential these techniques may have on
beyond-accuracy evaluation while analyzing the effect on reproducibility these
complementary dimensions may spark. Available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There has been a growing interest in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to
alleviate the data scalability issue, while the existing works usually focus on
classifying independently discrete labels. However, in many tasks (e.g.,
medical diagnosis), the labels are discrete and successively distributed. The
UDA for ordinal classification requires inducing non-trivial ordinal
distribution prior to the latent space. Target for this, the partially ordered
set (poset) is defined for constraining the latent vector. Instead of the
typically i.i.d. Gaussian latent prior, in this work, a recursively conditional
Gaussian (RCG) set is proposed for ordered constraint modeling, which admits a
tractable joint distribution prior. Furthermore, we are able to control the
density of content vectors that violate the poset constraint by a simple
"three-sigma rule". We explicitly disentangle the cross-domain images into a
shared ordinal prior induced ordinal content space and two separate
source/target ordinal-unrelated spaces, and the self-training is worked on the
shared space exclusively for ordinal-aware domain alignment. Extensive
experiments on UDA medical diagnoses and facial age estimation demonstrate its
effectiveness.]]></summary>

semi-supervised node classification problems. A variety of graph neural network
(GNN) based approaches have been proposed to tackle these problems, which
typically determine output labels through feature aggregation. This can be
problematic, as it implies conditional independence of output nodes given
hidden representations, despite their direct connections in the graph. To learn
the direct influence among output nodes in a graph, we propose the Explicit
Pairwise Factorized Graph Neural Network (EPFGNN), which models the whole graph
as a partially observed Markov Random Field. It contains explicit pairwise
factors to model output-output relations and uses a GNN backbone to model
input-output relations. To balance model complexity and expressivity, the
pairwise factors have a shared component and a separate scaling coefficient for
each edge. We apply the EM algorithm to train our model, and utilize a
star-shaped piecewise likelihood for the tractable surrogate objective. We
conduct experiments on various datasets, which shows that our model can
effectively improve the performance for semi-supervised node classification on

their excellent real-time performance as raw data from most of the mainstream
3D sensors. Therefore, point cloud neural networks have become a popular
research direction in recent years. So far, however, there has been little
discussion about the explainability of deep neural networks for point clouds.
In this paper, we propose new explainability approaches for point cloud deep
neural networks based on local surrogate model-based methods to show which
components make the main contribution to the classification. Moreover, we
propose a quantitative validation method for explainability methods of point
clouds which enhances the persuasive power of explainability by dropping the
most positive or negative contributing features and monitoring how the
classification scores of specific categories change. To enable an intuitive
explanation of misclassified instances, we display features with confounding
contributions. Our new explainability approach provides a fairly accurate, more
intuitive and widely applicable explanation for point cloud classification
tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/Explain3D/Explainable3D]]></summary>

introduced into the OFDM system model. Wireless channel data is generated
through simulation, the preprocessed time series feature information is input
into the LSTM to complete the offline training. Finally, the trained model is
used for online recovery of transmitted signal. The difference between this
scheme and existing OFDM receiver is that explicit estimated channel state
information (CSI) is transformed into invisible estimated CSI, and the transmit
symbol is directly restored. Simulation results show that the DDLSD scheme
outperforms the existing traditional methods in terms of improving channel

acceleration is possible because the emulator itself is used to estimate the
error, and we illustrate with two examples. The first uses cubic spline
interpolation to find the roots of a polynomial with variable coefficients. The
second example uses eigenvector continuation to find the eigenvectors and

this problem by finding a personalized model for each client. Recent works
widely report the average personalized model accuracy on a particular data

considering the multitude of personalization approaches proposed, it is
critical to study the per-user personalized accuracy and the accuracy
improvements among users with an equitable notion of fairness. To address these

generative models such as VAEs and rate-distortion losses used in learned
compression, most of this work has focused on images. In a similar spirit, we
view recently proposed neural video coding algorithms through the lens of deep
autoregressive and latent variable modeling. We present recent neural video
codecs as instances of a generalized stochastic temporal autoregressive
transform, and propose new avenues for further improvements inspired by
normalizing flows and structured priors. We propose several architectures that
yield state-of-the-art video compression performance on full-resolution video
and discuss their tradeoffs and ablations. In particular, we propose (i)
improved temporal autoregressive transforms, (ii) improved entropy models with
structured and temporal dependencies, and (iii) variable bitrate versions of
our algorithms. Since our improvements are compatible with a large class of
existing models, we provide further evidence that the generative modeling
viewpoint can advance the neural video coding field.]]></summary>

the functions they can approximate. However, the constructions from
approximation theory often have unrealistic aspects, for example, reliance on
infinite precision to memorize target function values, which make these results
potentially less meaningful. To address these issues, this work proposes a
formal definition of statistically meaningful approximation which requires the
approximating network to exhibit good statistical learnability. We present case
studies on statistically meaningful approximation for two classes of functions:
boolean circuits and Turing machines. We show that overparameterized
feedforward neural nets can statistically meaningfully approximate boolean
circuits with sample complexity depending only polynomially on the circuit
size, not the size of the approximating network. In addition, we show that
transformers can statistically meaningfully approximate Turing machines with
computation time bounded by $T$, requiring sample complexity polynomial in the
alphabet size, state space size, and $\log (T)$. Our analysis introduces new
tools for generalization bounds that provide much tighter sample complexity
guarantees than the typical VC-dimension or norm-based bounds, which may be of
independent interest.]]></summary>

period mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is essential for the delayed disease
progression and the improved quality of patients'life. The emerging
computer-aided diagnostic methods that combine deep learning with structural
magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) have achieved encouraging results, but some
of them are limit of issues such as data leakage and unexplainable diagnosis.
In this research, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning approach for
automated diagnosis of AD and localization of important brain regions related
to the disease from sMRI data. This approach is based on a 2D single model
strategy and has the following differences from the current approaches: 1)
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models of different structures and
capacities are evaluated systemically and the most suitable model is adopted
for AD diagnosis; 2) a data augmentation strategy named Two-stage Random
RandAugment (TRRA) is proposed to alleviate the overfitting issue caused by
limited training data and to improve the classification performance in AD
diagnosis; 3) an explainable method of Grad-CAM++ is introduced to generate the
visually explainable heatmaps that localize and highlight the brain regions
that our model focuses on and to make our model more transparent. Our approach
has been evaluated on two publicly accessible datasets for two classification
tasks of AD vs. cognitively normal (CN) and progressive MCI (pMCI) vs. stable
MCI (sMCI). The experimental results indicate that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches, including those using multi-model and 3D CNN
methods. The resultant localization heatmaps from our approach also highlight
the lateral ventricle and some disease-relevant regions of cortex, coincident
with the commonly affected regions during the development of AD.]]></summary>

other applications, there is a great interest in understanding which functions
are efficiently approximated by the outputs of neural networks. By now, there
exists a variety of results which show that a wide range of functions can be
approximated with sometimes surprising accuracy by these outputs. For example,
it is known that the set of functions that can be approximated with exponential
accuracy (in terms of the number of parameters used) includes, on one hand,
very smooth functions such as polynomials and analytic functions (see e.g.
\cite{E,S,Y}) and, on the other hand, very rough functions such as the
Weierstrass function (see e.g. \cite{EPGB,DDFHP}), which is nowhere
differentiable. In this paper, we add to the latter class of rough functions by
showing that it also includes refinable functions. Namely, we show that
refinable functions are approximated by the outputs of deep ReLU networks with
a fixed width and increasing depth with accuracy exponential in terms of their
number of parameters. Our results apply to functions used in the standard
construction of wavelets as well as to functions constructed via subdivision

DyPa, a simple heuristic for automatically allocating task-specific parameters
to tasks that could benefit from extra capacity. Using our large-scale MTL

geometrically reconstruct fluid interfaces in Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD) modeling of two-phase flows. PLIC reconstructs interfaces from a scalar
field that represents the volume fraction of each phase in each computational
cell. Given the volume fraction and interface normal, the location of a linear
interface is uniquely defined. For a cubic computational cell (3D), the
position of the planar interface is determined by intersecting the cube with a
plane, such that the volume of the resulting truncated polyhedron cell is equal
to the volume fraction. Yet it is geometrically complex to find the exact
position of the plane, and it involves calculations that can be a computational
bottleneck of many CFD models. However, while the forward problem of 3D PLIC is
challenging, the inverse problem, of finding the volume of the truncated
polyhedron cell given a defined plane, is simple. In this work, we propose a
deep learning model for the solution to the forward problem of PLIC by only
making use of its inverse problem. The proposed model is up to several orders
of magnitude faster than traditional schemes, which significantly reduces the
computational bottleneck of PLIC in CFD simulations.]]></summary>

calculating metrics on a small item subset (target set) to speed up
computation. The target set contains the relevant item and a set of negative
items that are sampled from the full item set. Two well-known strategies to
sample negative items are uniform random sampling and sampling by popularity to
better approximate the item frequency distribution in the dataset. Most
recently published papers on sequential item recommendation rely on sampling by
popularity to compare the evaluated models. However, recent work has already
shown that an evaluation with uniform random sampling may not be consistent
with the full ranking, that is, the model ranking obtained by evaluating a
metric using the full item set as target set, which raises the question whether
the ranking obtained by sampling by popularity is equal to the full ranking. In
this work, we re-evaluate current state-of-the-art sequential recommender
models from the point of view, whether these sampling strategies have an impact
on the final ranking of the models. We therefore train four recently proposed
sequential recommendation models on five widely known datasets. For each
dataset and model, we employ three evaluation strategies. First, we compute the
full model ranking. Then we evaluate all models on a target set sampled by the
two different sampling strategies, uniform random sampling and sampling by
popularity with the commonly used target set size of 100, compute the model
ranking for each strategy and compare them with each other. Additionally, we
vary the size of the sampled target set. Overall, we find that both sampling
strategies can produce inconsistent rankings compared with the full ranking of

a trained professional. In an attempt to expedite this process, an active area
of research involves automating cell classification through use of deep
learning-based techniques. In practice, a large amount of data is required to
accurately train these deep learning models. However, due to the sparse human
cell datasets currently available, the performance of these models is typically
low. This study investigates the feasibility of using few-shot learning-based
techniques to mitigate the data requirements for accurate training. The study
is comprised of three parts: First, current state-of-the-art few-shot learning
techniques are evaluated on human cell classification. The selected techniques
are trained on a non-medical dataset and then tested on two out-of-domain,
human cell datasets. The results indicate that, overall, the test accuracy of
state-of-the-art techniques decreased by at least 30% when transitioning from a
non-medical dataset to a medical dataset. Second, this study evaluates the
potential benefits, if any, to varying the backbone architecture and training
schemes in current state-of-the-art few-shot learning techniques when used in
human cell classification. Even with these variations, the overall test
accuracy decreased from 88.66% on non-medical datasets to 44.13% at best on the
medical datasets. Third, this study presents future directions for using
few-shot learning in human cell classification. In general, few-shot learning
in its current state performs poorly on human cell classification. The study
proves that attempts to modify existing network architectures are not effective
and concludes that future research effort should be focused on improving
robustness towards out-of-domain testing using optimization-based or

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Camera calibration is an important prerequisite towards the solution of 3D
computer vision problems. Traditional methods rely on static images of a
calibration pattern. This raises interesting challenges towards the practical
usage of event cameras, which notably require image change to produce
sufficient measurements. The current standard for event camera calibration
therefore consists of using flashing patterns. They have the advantage of
simultaneously triggering events in all reprojected pattern feature locations,
but it is difficult to construct or use such patterns in the field. We present
the first dynamic event camera calibration algorithm. It calibrates directly
from events captured during relative motion between camera and calibration
pattern. The method is propelled by a novel feature extraction mechanism for
calibration patterns, and leverages existing calibration tools before
optimizing all parameters through a multi-segment continuous-time formulation.
As demonstrated through our results on real data, the obtained calibration
method is highly convenient and reliably calibrates from data sequences
spanning less than 10 seconds.]]></summary>

damages, and uprooting communities, ecosystems and economies. Accurate and
robust flood detection including delineating open water flood areas and
identifying flood levels can aid in disaster response and mitigation. However,
estimating flood levels remotely is of essence as physical access to flooded
areas is limited and the ability to deploy instruments in potential flood zones
can be dangerous. Aligning flood extent mapping with local topography can
provide a plan-of-action that the disaster response team can consider. Thus,
remote flood level estimation via satellites like Sentinel-1 can prove to be
remedial. The Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence (ETCI)
competition on Flood Detection tasked participants with predicting flooded
pixels after training with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images in a
supervised setting. We use a cyclical approach involving two stages (1)
training an ensemble model of multiple UNet architectures with available high
and low confidence labeled data and, (2) generating pseudo labels or low
confidence labels on the unlabeled test dataset, and then, combining the
generated labels with the previously available high confidence labeled dataset.
This assimilated dataset is used for the next round of training ensemble
models. This cyclical process is repeated until the performance improvement
plateaus. Additionally, we post process our results with Conditional Random
Fields. Our approach sets a high score on the public leaderboard for the ETCI
competition with 0.7654 IoU. Our method, which we release with all the code
including trained models, can also be used as an open science benchmark for the
Sentinel-1 released dataset on GitHub. To the best of our knowledge we believe
this the first works to try out semi-supervised learning to improve flood
segmentation models.]]></summary>

However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as
long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has
quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence
length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an
efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear
complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range
attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a
short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a
dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two
attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and
bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains,
including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and
ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on
enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being
faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its
full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the
state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained
on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more
scalable on high-resolution images. The source code and models are released at

training time. Relative positions are more robust to length change, but are
more complex to implement and yield inferior model throughput. In this paper,

the accurate understanding of the complex 3D shapes (e.g., high-curvature,
concave/convex, and hollowed-out 3D shapes) and the unknown & diverse patterns
of the partially available point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel
solution,i.e., Point-block Carving (PC), for completing the complex 3D point
cloud completion. Given the partial point cloud as the guidance, we carve a3D
block that contains the uniformly distributed 3D points, yielding the entire
point cloud. To achieve PC, we propose a new network architecture, i.e.,
CarveNet. This network conducts the exclusive convolution on each point of the
block, where the convolutional kernels are trained on the 3D shape data.
CarveNet determines which point should be carved, for effectively recovering
the details of the complete shapes. Furthermore, we propose a sensor-aware
method for data augmentation,i.e., SensorAug, for training CarveNet on richer
patterns of partial point clouds, thus enhancing the completion power of the
network. The extensive evaluations on the ShapeNet and KITTI datasets
demonstrate the generality of our approach on the partial point clouds with
diverse patterns. On these datasets, CarveNet successfully outperforms the

that exploits readily available robot "self-knowledge" such as proprioception,

dynamics models that pair a transferable, robot-agnostic world dynamics module
with a robot-specific, analytical robot dynamics module. Next, we set up visual
planning costs that draw a distinction between the robot self and the world.
Our experiments on tabletop manipulation tasks in simulation and on real robots

domain to a new environment, i.e., target domain. One common practice is to
train the model on both labeled source-domain data and unlabeled target-domain
data. Yet the learned models are usually biased due to the strong supervision
of the source domain. Most researchers adopt the early-stopping strategy to
prevent over-fitting, but when to stop training remains a challenging problem
since the lack of the target-domain validation set. In this paper, we propose
one efficient bootstrapping method, called Adaboost Student, explicitly
learning complementary models during training and liberating users from
empirical early stopping. Adaboost Student combines the deep model learning
with the conventional training strategy, i.e., adaptive boosting, and enables
interactions between learned models and the data sampler. We adopt one adaptive
data sampler to progressively facilitate learning on hard samples and aggregate
"weak" models to prevent over-fitting. Extensive experiments show that (1)
Without the need to worry about the stopping time, AdaBoost Student provides
one robust solution by efficient complementary model learning during training.
(2) AdaBoost Student is orthogonal to most domain adaptation methods, which can
be combined with existing approaches to further improve the state-of-the-art
performance. We have achieved competitive results on three widely-used scene

considered. In this manuscript, a novel method for the restoration of
clouds-corrupted optical images is presented, able to generate the whole
optical scene of interest, not only the cloudy pixels, and based on a Joint
Data Fusion paradigm, where three deep neural networks are hierarchically
combined. Spatio-temporal features are separately extracted by a conditional
Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) and by a Convolutional Long Short-Term
Memory (ConvLSTM), from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and optical
time-series of data respectively, and then combined with a U-shaped network.
The use of time-series of data has been rarely explored in the state of the art
for this peculiar objective, and moreover existing models do not combine both
spatio-temporal domains and SAR-optical imagery. Quantitative and qualitative
results have shown a good ability of the proposed method in producing
cloud-free images, by also preserving the details and outperforming the cGAN

networks can be interpreted as different numerical discretisations of
differential equations. The design of ResNet follows a relatively simple
scheme, which is Euler forward; however, the situation becomes complicated
rapidly while stacking. We suppose that stacked ResNet is somehow equalled to a
higher-order scheme; then, the current method of forwarding propagation might
be relatively weak compared with a typical high-order method such as
Runge-Kutta. We propose HO-ResNet to verify the hypothesis of widely used CV
benchmarks with sufficient experiments. Stable and noticeable increases in
performance are observed, and convergence and robustness are also improved. Our
stacking strategy improved ResNet-30 by 2.15 per cent and ResNet-58 by 2.35 per
cent on CIFAR-10, with the same settings and parameters. The proposed strategy
is fundamental and theoretical and can therefore be applied to any network as a
general guideline.]]></summary>

the parameters after every few iterations, train until either a human observer
or a simple metric-based heuristic decides the network isn't learning anymore,
and then backtrack and pick the saved parameters with the best validation
accuracy. Simple methods are used to determine if a neural network isn't
learning anymore because, as long as it's well after the optimal values are
found, the condition doesn't impact the final accuracy of the model. However
from a runtime perspective, this is of great significance to the many cases
where numerous neural networks are trained simultaneously (e.g. hyper-parameter
tuning). Motivated by this, we introduce a statistical significance test to
determine if a neural network has stopped learning. This stopping criterion
appears to represent a happy medium compared to other popular stopping
criterions, achieving comparable accuracy to the criterions that achieve the
highest final accuracies in 77% or fewer epochs, while the criterions which
stop sooner do so with an appreciable loss to final accuracy. Additionally, we
use this as the basis of a new learning rate scheduler, removing the need to
manually choose learning rate schedules and acting as a quasi-line search,
achieving superior or comparable empirical performance to existing methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weakly-supervised temporal action localization (WS-TAL) aims to localize
actions in untrimmed videos with only video-level labels. Most existing models
follow the "localization by classification" procedure: locate temporal regions
contributing most to the video-level classification. Generally, they process
each snippet (or frame) individually and thus overlook the fruitful temporal
context relation. Here arises the single snippet cheating issue: "hard"
snippets are too vague to be classified. In this paper, we argue that learning
by comparing helps identify these hard snippets and we propose to utilize
snippet Contrastive learning to Localize Actions, CoLA for short. Specifically,
we propose a Snippet Contrast (SniCo) Loss to refine the hard snippet
representation in feature space, which guides the network to perceive precise
temporal boundaries and avoid the temporal interval interruption. Besides,
since it is infeasible to access frame-level annotations, we introduce a Hard
Snippet Mining algorithm to locate the potential hard snippets. Substantial
analyses verify that this mining strategy efficaciously captures the hard
snippets and SniCo Loss leads to more informative feature representation.
Extensive experiments show that CoLA achieves state-of-the-art results on
THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet v1.2 datasets. CoLA code is publicly available at

to distract the classifier in the learning process to force it to focus not

informative for the discrimination of the class. We tested the proposed
approach by embedding it into the learning process of a convolutional neural
network for the analysis and classification of two well-known datasets, namely
Stanford cars and FGVC-Aircraft. Furthermore, we evaluated our model on a
real-case scenario for the classification of egocentric images, allowing us to
obtain relevant information about peoples' lifestyles. In particular, we work

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crowd counting has drawn much attention due to its importance in
safety-critical surveillance systems. Especially, deep neural network (DNN)
methods have significantly reduced estimation errors for crowd counting
missions. Recent studies have demonstrated that DNNs are vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, i.e., normal images with human-imperceptible perturbations
could mislead DNNs to make false predictions. In this work, we propose a robust
attack strategy called Adversarial Patch Attack with Momentum (APAM) to
systematically evaluate the robustness of crowd counting models, where the
attacker's goal is to create an adversarial perturbation that severely degrades
their performances, thus leading to public safety accidents (e.g., stampede
accidents). Especially, the proposed attack leverages the extreme-density
background information of input images to generate robust adversarial patches
via a series of transformations (e.g., interpolation, rotation, etc.). We
observe that by perturbing less than 6\% of image pixels, our attacks severely
degrade the performance of crowd counting systems, both digitally and
physically. To better enhance the adversarial robustness of crowd counting
models, we propose the first regression model-based Randomized Ablation (RA),
which is more sufficient than Adversarial Training (ADT) (Mean Absolute Error
of RA is 5 lower than ADT on clean samples and 30 lower than ADT on adversarial
examples). Extensive experiments on five crowd counting models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generality of the proposed method. The supplementary

major challenge in neural architecture search (NAS). To reduce the architecture
training costs in NAS, one-shot estimators (OSEs) amortize the architecture
training costs by sharing the parameters of one supernet between all
architectures. Recently, zero-shot estimators (ZSEs) that involve no training
are proposed to further reduce the architecture evaluation cost. Despite the
high efficiency of these estimators, the quality of such estimations has not
been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we conduct an extensive and organized
assessment of OSEs and ZSEs on three NAS benchmarks: NAS-Bench-101/201/301.
Specifically, we employ a set of NAS-oriented criteria to study the behavior of
OSEs and ZSEs and reveal that they have certain biases and variances. After
analyzing how and why the OSE estimations are unsatisfying, we explore how to
mitigate the correlation gap of OSEs from several perspectives. For ZSEs, we
find that current ZSEs are not satisfying enough in these benchmark search
spaces, and analyze their biases. Through our analysis, we give out suggestions
for future application and development of efficient architecture performance
estimators. Furthermore, the analysis framework proposed in our work could be
utilized in future research to give a more comprehensive understanding of newly
designed architecture performance estimators. All codes and analysis scripts

to achieve the measurement accuracy required for modern perception and
navigation systems deployed on autonomous robots. To date, intrinsic
calibration models for spinning LiDARs have been based on hypothesized based on
their physical mechanisms, resulting in anywhere from three to ten parameters
to be estimated from data, while no phenomenological models have yet been
proposed for solid-state LiDARs. Instead of going down that road, we propose to
abstract away from the physics of a LiDAR type (spinning vs solid-state, for
example), and focus on the spatial geometry of the point cloud generated by the
sensor. By modeling the calibration parameters as an element of a special
matrix Lie Group, we achieve a unifying view of calibration for different types
of LiDARs. We further prove mathematically that the proposed model is
well-constrained (has a unique answer) given four appropriately orientated
targets. The proof provides a guideline for target positioning in the form of a
tetrahedron. Moreover, an existing Semidefinite programming global solver for
SE(3) can be modified to compute efficiently the optimal calibration
parameters. For solid state LiDARs, we illustrate how the method works in
simulation. For spinning LiDARs, we show with experimental data that the
proposed matrix Lie Group model performs equally well as physics-based models
in terms of reducing the P2P distance, while being more robust to noise.]]></summary>

category and viewpoint in separate and shared network architectures, and
observe starkly different trends on in-distribution and OOD combinations, ie.
while shared networks are helpful in-distribution, separate networks
significantly outperform shared ones at OOD combinations. Finally, we
demonstrate that such OOD generalization is facilitated by the neural mechanism
of specialization, ie. the emergence of two types of neurons -- neurons

alleviate the data scalability issue, while the existing works usually focus on
classifying independently discrete labels. However, in many tasks (e.g.,
medical diagnosis), the labels are discrete and successively distributed. The
UDA for ordinal classification requires inducing non-trivial ordinal
distribution prior to the latent space. Target for this, the partially ordered
set (poset) is defined for constraining the latent vector. Instead of the
typically i.i.d. Gaussian latent prior, in this work, a recursively conditional
Gaussian (RCG) set is proposed for ordered constraint modeling, which admits a
tractable joint distribution prior. Furthermore, we are able to control the
density of content vectors that violate the poset constraint by a simple
"three-sigma rule". We explicitly disentangle the cross-domain images into a
shared ordinal prior induced ordinal content space and two separate
source/target ordinal-unrelated spaces, and the self-training is worked on the
shared space exclusively for ordinal-aware domain alignment. Extensive
experiments on UDA medical diagnoses and facial age estimation demonstrate its

generating realistic data. Extending purely data-driven approaches, recent
specialized DGMs may satisfy additional controllable requirements such as
embedding a traffic sign in a driving scene, by manipulating patterns
\textit{implicitly} in the neuron or feature level. In this paper, we introduce
a novel method to incorporate domain knowledge \textit{explicitly} in the
generation process to achieve semantically controllable scene generation. We
categorize our knowledge into two types to be consistent with the composition
of natural scenes, where the first type represents the property of objects and
the second type represents the relationship among objects. We then propose a
tree-structured generative model to learn complex scene representation, whose
nodes and edges are naturally corresponding to the two types of knowledge
respectively. Knowledge can be explicitly integrated to enable semantically
controllable scene generation by imposing semantic rules on properties of nodes
and edges in the tree structure. We construct a synthetic example to illustrate
the controllability and explainability of our method in a clean setting. We
further extend the synthetic example to realistic autonomous vehicle driving
environments and conduct extensive experiments to show that our method
efficiently identifies adversarial traffic scenes against different
state-of-the-art 3D point cloud segmentation models satisfying the traffic
rules specified as the explicit knowledge.]]></summary>

augmented reality (AR), computer interfaces, robotics and autonomous systems.
Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are one of the enabling technologies
providing accurate depth data even over long ranges. By developing SPADs in
array format with integrated processing combined with pulsed, flood-type
illumination, high-speed 3D capture is possible. However, array sizes tend to
be relatively small, limiting the lateral resolution of the resulting depth
maps, and, consequently, the information that can be extracted from the image
for applications such as object detection. In this paper, we demonstrate that
these limitations can be overcome through the use of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) for high-performance object detection. We present outdoor
results from a portable SPAD camera system that outputs 16-bin photon timing
histograms with 64x32 spatial resolution. The results, obtained with exposure
times down to 2 ms (equivalent to 500 FPS) and in signal-to-background (SBR)
ratios as low as 0.05, point to the advantages of providing the CNN with full
histogram data rather than point clouds alone. Alternatively, a combination of
point cloud and active intensity data may be used as input, for a similar level
of performance. In either case, the GPU-accelerated processing time is less
than 1 ms per frame, leading to an overall latency (image acquisition plus
processing) in the millisecond range, making the results relevant for
safety-critical computer vision applications which would benefit from faster
than human reaction times.]]></summary>

spread all over the world, posing an extremely serious threat to all countries.
Automatic lung infection segmentation from computed tomography (CT) plays an
important role in the quantitative analysis of COVID-19. However, the major
challenge lies in the inadequacy of annotated COVID-19 datasets. Currently,
there are several public non-COVID lung lesion segmentation datasets, providing
the potential for generalizing useful information to the related COVID-19
segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-driven
collaborative learning model to exploit shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions
for annotation-efficient COVID-19 CT lung infection segmentation. The model
consists of a general encoder to capture general lung lesion features based on
multiple non-COVID lesions, and a target encoder to focus on task-specific
features based on COVID-19 infections. Features extracted from the two parallel
encoders are concatenated for the subsequent decoder part. We develop a
collaborative learning scheme to regularize feature-level relation consistency
of given input and encourage the model to learn more general and discriminative
representation of COVID-19 infections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
trained with limited COVID-19 data, exploiting shared knowledge from non-COVID
lesions can further improve state-of-the-art performance with up to 3.0% in
dice similarity coefficient and 4.2% in normalized surface dice. Our proposed
method promotes new insights into annotation-efficient deep learning for
COVID-19 infection segmentation and illustrates strong potential for real-world
applications in the global fight against COVID-19 in the absence of sufficient
high-quality annotations.]]></summary>

the learning of a small student network from a large teacher network is being
actively studied for model compression and transfer learning. However, few
studies have been performed to resolve the poor learning issue of the student
network when the student and teacher model sizes significantly differ. In this
paper, we propose a densely guided knowledge distillation using multiple
teacher assistants that gradually decreases the model size to efficiently
bridge the large gap between the teacher and student networks. To stimulate
more efficient learning of the student network, we guide each teacher assistant
to every other smaller teacher assistants iteratively. Specifically, when
teaching a smaller teacher assistant at the next step, the existing larger
teacher assistants from the previous step are used as well as the teacher
network. Moreover, we design stochastic teaching where, for each mini-batch, a
teacher or teacher assistants are randomly dropped. This acts as a regularizer
to improve the efficiency of teaching of the student network. Thus, the student
can always learn salient distilled knowledge from the multiple sources. We
verified the effectiveness of the proposed method for a classification task
using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. We also achieved significant
performance improvements with various backbone architectures such as ResNet,
WideResNet, and VGG.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present the Regensburg Breast Shape Model (RBSM) - a 3D statistical shape
model of the female breast built from 110 breast scans, and the first ever
publicly available. Together with the model, a fully automated, pairwise
surface registration pipeline used to establish correspondence among 3D breast
scans is introduced. Our method is computationally efficient and requires only
four landmarks to guide the registration process. In order to weaken the strong
coupling between breast and thorax, we propose to minimize the variance outside
the breast region as much as possible. To achieve this goal, a novel concept
called breast probability masks (BPMs) is introduced. A BPM assigns
probabilities to each point of a 3D breast scan, telling how likely it is that
a particular point belongs to the breast area. During registration, we use BPMs
to align the template to the target as accurately as possible inside the breast
region and only roughly outside. This simple yet effective strategy
significantly reduces the unwanted variance outside the breast region, leading
to better statistical shape models in which breast shapes are quite well
decoupled from the thorax. The RBSM is thus able to produce a variety of
different breast shapes as independently as possible from the shape of the
thorax. Our systematic experimental evaluation reveals a generalization ability
of 0.17 mm and a specificity of 2.8 mm for the RBSM. Ultimately, our model is
seen as a first step towards combining physically motivated deformable models
of the breast and statistical approaches in order to enable more realistic
surgical outcome simulation.]]></summary>

features or local-neighboring voxel-based features, and demonstrate great
potential for processing 3D data. However, the point based models are
inefficient due to the unordered nature of point clouds and the voxel-based
models suffer from large information loss. Motivated by the success of recent
point-voxel representation, such as PVCNN, we propose a new convolutional
neural network, called Multi Point-Voxel Convolution (MPVConv), for deep
learning on point clouds. Integrating both the advantages of voxel and
point-based methods, MPVConv can effectively increase the neighboring
collection between point-based features and also promote independence among
voxel-based features. Moreover, most of the existing approaches aim at solving
one specific task, and only a few of them can handle a variety of tasks. Simply
replacing the corresponding convolution module with MPVConv, we show that
MPVConv can fit in different backbones to solve a wide range of 3D tasks.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets such as ShapeNet Part, S3DIS and
KITTI for various tasks show that MPVConv improves the accuracy of the backbone
(PointNet) by up to \textbf{36\%}, and achieves higher accuracy than the
voxel-based model with up to \textbf{34}$\times$ speedups. In addition, MPVConv
outperforms the state-of-the-art point-based models with up to
\textbf{8}$\times$ speedups. Notably, our MPVConv achieves better accuracy than
the newest point-voxel-based model PVCNN (a model more efficient than PointNet)
with lower latency.]]></summary>

In this paper, we present a simple yet effective continual learning method for
BIQA with improved quality prediction accuracy, plasticity-stability trade-off,
and task-order/length robustness. The key step in our approach is to freeze all
convolution filters of a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) for an explicit
promise of stability, and learn task-specific normalization parameters for
plasticity. We assign each new task a prediction head, and load the
corresponding normalization parameters to produce a quality score. The final
quality estimate is computed by feature fusion and adaptive weighting using
hierarchical representations, without leveraging the test-time oracle.
Extensive experiments on six IQA datasets demonstrate the advantages of the
proposed method in comparison to previous training techniques for BIQA.]]></summary>

image generation using deep learning. Specifically, we explored a generative
adversarial network (GAN) model capable of generating high-resolution and
realistic river images that can be used to support modeling and analysis in
surface water estimation, river meandering, wetland loss, and other
hydrological research studies. First, we have created an extensive repository
of overhead river images to be used in training. Second, we incorporated the
Progressive Growing GAN (PGGAN), a network architecture that iteratively trains
smaller-resolution GANs to gradually build up to a very high resolution to
generate high quality (i.e., 1024x1024) synthetic river imagery. With simpler
GAN architectures, difficulties arose in terms of exponential increase of
training time and vanishing/exploding gradient issues, which the PGGAN
implementation seemed to significantly reduce. The results presented in this
study show great promise in generating high-quality images and capturing the
details of river structure and flow to support hydrological research, which

their excellent real-time performance as raw data from most of the mainstream
3D sensors. Therefore, point cloud neural networks have become a popular
research direction in recent years. So far, however, there has been little
discussion about the explainability of deep neural networks for point clouds.
In this paper, we propose new explainability approaches for point cloud deep
neural networks based on local surrogate model-based methods to show which
components make the main contribution to the classification. Moreover, we
propose a quantitative validation method for explainability methods of point
clouds which enhances the persuasive power of explainability by dropping the
most positive or negative contributing features and monitoring how the
classification scores of specific categories change. To enable an intuitive
explanation of misclassified instances, we display features with confounding
contributions. Our new explainability approach provides a fairly accurate, more
intuitive and widely applicable explanation for point cloud classification
tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/Explain3D/Explainable3D]]></summary>

the efficiency of the network. we search for the network structure of the
feature fusion module using NAS techniques. Finally, be aware of that
generating pseudo-LiDAR from RGB via depth estimation introduces extra
computational costs and relies on depth estimation networks, we design a

period mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is essential for the delayed disease
progression and the improved quality of patients'life. The emerging
computer-aided diagnostic methods that combine deep learning with structural
magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) have achieved encouraging results, but some
of them are limit of issues such as data leakage and unexplainable diagnosis.
In this research, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning approach for
automated diagnosis of AD and localization of important brain regions related
to the disease from sMRI data. This approach is based on a 2D single model
strategy and has the following differences from the current approaches: 1)
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models of different structures and
capacities are evaluated systemically and the most suitable model is adopted
for AD diagnosis; 2) a data augmentation strategy named Two-stage Random
RandAugment (TRRA) is proposed to alleviate the overfitting issue caused by
limited training data and to improve the classification performance in AD
diagnosis; 3) an explainable method of Grad-CAM++ is introduced to generate the
visually explainable heatmaps that localize and highlight the brain regions
that our model focuses on and to make our model more transparent. Our approach
has been evaluated on two publicly accessible datasets for two classification
tasks of AD vs. cognitively normal (CN) and progressive MCI (pMCI) vs. stable
MCI (sMCI). The experimental results indicate that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches, including those using multi-model and 3D CNN
methods. The resultant localization heatmaps from our approach also highlight
the lateral ventricle and some disease-relevant regions of cortex, coincident
with the commonly affected regions during the development of AD.]]></summary>

search is the evaluation of candidate models within a predefined search space.
In practice, a one-shot supernet is trained to serve as an evaluator. A
faithful ranking certainly leads to more accurate searching results. However,
current methods are prone to making misjudgments. In this paper, we prove that
their biased evaluation is due to inherent unfairness in the supernet training.
In view of this, we propose two levels of constraints: expectation fairness and
strict fairness. Particularly, strict fairness ensures equal optimization
opportunities for all choice blocks throughout the training, which neither
overestimates nor underestimates their capacity. We demonstrate that this is
crucial for improving the confidence of models' ranking. Incorporating the
one-shot supernet trained under the proposed fairness constraints with a
multi-objective evolutionary search algorithm, we obtain various
state-of-the-art models, e.g., FairNAS-A attains 77.5% top-1 validation
accuracy on ImageNet. The models and their evaluation codes are made publicly

farming, we propose a new dataset (UDD) consisting of three categories
(seacucumber, seaurchin, and scallop) with 2,227 images. To the best of our
knowledge, it is the first 4K HD dataset collected in a real open-sea farm. We
also propose a novel Poisson-blending Generative Adversarial Network (Poisson
GAN) and an efficient object detection network (AquaNet) to address two common
issues within related datasets: the class-imbalance problem and the problem of
mass small object, respectively. Specifically, Poisson GAN combines Poisson
blending into its generator and employs a new loss called Dual Restriction loss
(DR loss), which supervises both implicit space features and image-level
features during training to generate more realistic images. By utilizing
Poisson GAN, objects of minority class like seacucumber or scallop could be
added into an image naturally and annotated automatically, which could increase
the loss of minority classes during training detectors to eliminate the
class-imbalance problem; AquaNet is a high-efficiency detector to address the
problem of detecting mass small objects from cloudy underwater pictures. Within
it, we design two efficient components: a depth-wise-convolution-based
Multi-scale Contextual Features Fusion (MFF) block and a Multi-scale
Blursampling (MBP) module to reduce the parameters of the network to 1.3
million. Both two components could provide multi-scale features of small
objects under a short backbone configuration without any loss of accuracy. In
addition, we construct a large-scale augmented dataset (AUDD) and a
pre-training dataset via Poisson GAN from UDD. Extensive experiments show the
effectiveness of the proposed Poisson GAN, AquaNet, UDD, AUDD, and pre-training

conditions that affect a part of a patient's digestive system, such as the
stomach. Despite the fact that gastroendoscopy has a lot of advantages for
patients, there exist some challenges for practitioners, such as the lack of 3D
perception, including the depth and the endoscope pose information. Such
challenges make navigating the endoscope and localizing any found lesion in a
digestive tract difficult. To tackle these problems, deep learning-based
approaches have been proposed to provide monocular gastroendoscopy with
additional yet important depth and pose information. In this paper, we propose
a novel supervised approach to train depth and pose estimation networks using
consecutive endoscopy images to assist the endoscope navigation in the stomach.
We firstly generate real depth and pose training data using our previously
proposed whole stomach 3D reconstruction pipeline to avoid poor generalization
ability between computer-generated (CG) models and real data for the stomach.
In addition, we propose a novel generalized photometric loss function to avoid
the complicated process of finding proper weights for balancing the depth and
the pose loss terms, which is required for existing direct depth and pose
supervision approaches. We then experimentally show that our proposed
generalized loss performs better than existing direct supervision losses.]]></summary>

problem in computer vision. Previous works have shown promising performance to
generate synthetic images conditional on text by Generative Adversarial

Based on those constraints, a category-consistent and relativistic diverse
conditional GAN (CRD-CGAN) is proposed to synthesize $K$ photo-realistic images
simultaneously. We use the attention loss and diversity loss to improve the
sensitivity of the GAN to word attention and noises. Then, we employ the
relativistic conditional loss to estimate the probability of relatively real or
fake for synthetic images, which can improve the performance of basic
conditional loss. Finally, we introduce a category-consistent loss to alleviate
the over-category issues between K synthetic images. We evaluate our approach
using the Birds-200-2011, Oxford-102 flower and MSCOCO 2014 datasets, and the

prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation. However, convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) are inherently limited to model such dependencies due to the
naive structure in its building modules (\eg, local convolution kernel). While
recent global aggregation methods are beneficial for long-range structure
information modelling, they would oversmooth and bring noise to the regions
containing fine details (\eg,~boundaries and small objects), which are very
much cared for the semantic segmentation task. To alleviate this problem, we
propose to explore the local context for making the aggregated long-range
relationship being distributed more accurately in local regions. In particular,
we design a novel local distribution module which models the affinity map
between global and local relationship for each pixel adaptively. Integrating
existing global aggregation modules, we show that our approach can be
modularized as an end-to-end trainable block and easily plugged into existing
semantic segmentation networks, giving rise to the \emph{GALD} networks.
Despite its simplicity and versatility, our approach allows us to build new
state of the art on major semantic segmentation benchmarks including
Cityscapes, ADE20K, Pascal Context, Camvid and COCO-stuff. Code and trained
models are released at \url{https://github.com/lxtGH/GALD-DGCNet} to foster

a dataset without any localization information. By simply training a
classification model using only image-level annotations, the feature map of the
model can be utilized as a score map for localization. In spite of many WSOL
methods proposing novel strategies, there has not been any de facto standard
about how to normalize the class activation map (CAM). Consequently, many WSOL
methods have failed to fully exploit their own capacity because of the misuse
of a normalization method. In this paper, we review many existing normalization
methods and point out that they should be used according to the property of the
given dataset. Additionally, we propose a new normalization method which
substantially enhances the performance of any CAM-based WSOL methods. Using the
proposed normalization method, we provide a comprehensive evaluation over three
datasets (CUB, ImageNet and OpenImages) on three different architectures and
observe significant performance gains over the conventional min-max
normalization method in all the evaluated cases.]]></summary>

However, there are cases in which the resolution of input images is relatively

the amount of data that can be acquired. In this paper, we investigate if, how,

applications. However, the results are not always clinically acceptable and
require tedious manual revision. Here, we present a novel concept called
artificial intelligence assisted contour revision (AIACR) and demonstrate its
feasibility. The proposed clinical workflow of AIACR is as follows given an
initial contour that requires a clinicians revision, the clinician indicates
where a large revision is needed, and a trained deep learning (DL) model takes
this input to update the contour. This process repeats until a clinically
acceptable contour is achieved. The DL model is designed to minimize the
clinicians input at each iteration and to minimize the number of iterations
needed to reach acceptance. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated the
concept on 2D axial images of three head-and-neck cancer datasets, with the
clinicians input at each iteration being one mouse click on the desired
location of the contour segment. The performance of the model is quantified
with Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile of Hausdorff
Distance (HD95). The average DSC/HD95 (mm) of the auto-generated initial
contours were 0.82/4.3, 0.73/5.6 and 0.67/11.4 for three datasets, which were
improved to 0.91/2.1, 0.86/2.4 and 0.86/4.7 with three mouse clicks,
respectively. Each DL-based contour update requires around 20 ms. We proposed a
novel AIACR concept that uses DL models to assist clinicians in revising
contours in an efficient and effective way, and we demonstrated its feasibility
by using 2D axial CT images from three head-and-neck cancer datasets.]]></summary>

complementary information to each other that may not be evident when working
with individual modalities on their own. In this context, multi-modal models
can help producing more accurate and robust predictions in machine learning
tasks where audio-visual data is available. This paper presents a multi-modal
model for automatic scene classification that exploits simultaneously auditory
and visual information. The proposed approach makes use of two separate
networks which are respectively trained in isolation on audio and visual data,
so that each network specializes in a given modality. The visual subnetwork is
a pre-trained VGG16 model followed by a bidiretional recurrent layer, while the
residual audio subnetwork is based on stacked squeeze-excitation convolutional
blocks trained from scratch. After training each subnetwork, the fusion of
information from the audio and visual streams is performed at two different
stages. The early fusion stage combines features resulting from the last
convolutional block of the respective subnetworks at different time steps to
feed a bidirectional recurrent structure. The late fusion stage combines the
output of the early fusion stage with the independent predictions provided by
the two subnetworks, resulting in the final prediction. We evaluate the method
using the recently published TAU Audio-Visual Urban Scenes 2021, which contains
synchronized audio and video recordings from 12 European cities in 10 different
scene classes. The proposed model has been shown to provide an excellent
trade-off between prediction performance (86.5%) and system complexity (15M
parameters) in the evaluation results of the DCASE 2021 Challenge.]]></summary>

based on deep and complex systems that often cannot operate in real-time,
making them impractical for video-surveillance. In this paper we present a
long-term, multi-face tracking architecture conceived for working in crowded
contexts where faces are often the only visible part of a person. Our system
benefits from advances in the fields of face detection and face recognition to
achieve long-term tracking, and is particularly unconstrained to the motion and
occlusions of people. It follows a tracking-by-detection approach, combining a
fast short-term visual tracker with a novel online tracklet reconnection
strategy grounded on rank-based face verification. The proposed rank-based
constraint favours higher inter-class distance among tracklets, and reduces the
propagation of errors due to wrong reconnections. Additionally, a correction
module is included to correct past assignments with no extra computational
cost. We present a series of experiments introducing novel specialized metrics
for the evaluation of long-term tracking capabilities, and publicly release a
video dataset with 10 manually annotated videos and a total length of 8' 54".
Our findings validate the robustness of each of the proposed modules, and
demonstrate that, in these challenging contexts, our approach yields up to 50%

achieved noticeable results on numerous applications including image
classification, restoration, and generation. Although the weight-sharing
property of convolutions makes them widely adopted in various tasks, its
content-agnostic characteristic can also be considered a major drawback. To
solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel operation, called pixel
adaptive kernel attention (PAKA). PAKA provides directivity to the filter
weights by multiplying spatially varying attention from learnable features. The
proposed method infers pixel-adaptive attention maps along the channel and
spatial directions separately to address the decomposed model with fewer
parameters. Our method is trainable in an end-to-end manner and applicable to
any CNN-based models. In addition, we propose an improved information
aggregation module with PAKA, called the hierarchical PAKA module (HPM). We
demonstrate the superiority of our HPM by presenting state-of-the-art
performance on semantic segmentation compared to the conventional information
aggregation modules. We validate the proposed method through additional
ablation studies and visualizing the effect of PAKA providing directivity to

fragment data in the database to assist the archaeologists in matching the
actual fragments with the ones in the database, which could result in higher
repairing efficiency of terracotta warriors. Moreover, the existing 3D neural
network research is mainly focusing on supervised classification, clustering,
unsupervised representation, and reconstruction. There are few pieces of
researches concentrating on unsupervised point cloud part segmentation. In this
paper, we present SRG-Net for 3D point clouds of terracotta warriors to address
these problems. Firstly, we adopt a customized seed-region-growing algorithm to
segment the point cloud coarsely. Then we present a supervised segmentation and
unsupervised reconstruction networks to learn the characteristics of 3D point
clouds. Finally, we combine the SRG algorithm with our improved CNN using a
refinement method. This pipeline is called SRG-Net, which aims at conducting
segmentation tasks on the terracotta warriors. Our proposed SRG-Net is

valid alternative to unsupervised subspace clustering and temporal data
clustering for human motion segmentation (HMS). These approaches leverage prior
knowledge from a source domain to improve clustering performance on a target
domain, and currently they represent the state of the art in HMS. Bucking this
trend, in this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised model that learns a
representation of the data and digs clustering information from the data
itself. Our model is reminiscent of temporal subspace clustering, but presents
two critical differences. First, we learn an auxiliary data matrix that can
deviate from the initial data, hence confer more degrees of freedom to the
coding matrix. Second, we introduce a regularization term for this auxiliary
data matrix that preserves the local geometrical structure present in the
high-dimensional space. The proposed model is efficiently optimized by using an
original Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) formulation
allowing to learn jointly the auxiliary data representation, a nonnegative
dictionary and a coding matrix. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets
for HMS demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly better clustering
performance then state-of-the-art methods, including both unsupervised and more

almost one-third of deaths throughout the world. Detecting the disease early
increases the chances of survival of the patient and there are several ways a
sign of heart disease can be detected early. This research proposes to convert
cleansed and normalized heart sound into visual mel scale spectrograms and then
using visual domain transfer learning approaches to automatically extract
features and categorize between heart sounds. Some of the previous studies
found that the spectrogram of various types of heart sounds is visually
distinguishable to human eyes, which motivated this study to experiment on
visual domain classification approaches for automated heart sound
classification. It will use convolution neural network-based architectures i.e.
ResNet, MobileNetV2, etc as the automated feature extractors from spectrograms.
These well-accepted models in the image domain showed to learn generalized
feature representations of cardiac sounds collected from different environments
with varying amplitude and noise levels. Model evaluation criteria used were
categorical accuracy, precision, recall, and AUROC as the chosen dataset is
unbalanced. The proposed approach has been implemented on datasets A and B of
the PASCAL heart sound collection and resulted in ~ 90% categorical accuracy
and AUROC of ~0.97 for both sets.]]></summary>

authentication on mobile and hand held devices. Biometrics samples are acquired
using the camera mounted on mobile device with the help of a mobile application
having specific markers to register the teeth area. Region of interest (RoI) is
then extracted using the markers and the obtained sample is enhanced using
contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) for better visual
clarity. We propose a deep learning architecture and novel regularization
scheme to obtain highly discriminative embedding for small size RoI. Proposed
custom loss function was able to achieve perfect classification for the tiny
RoI of $75\times 75$ size. The model is end-to-end and few-shot and therefore
is very efficient in terms of time and energy requirements. The system can be
used in many ways including device unlocking and secure authentication. To the
best of our understanding, this is the first work on teeth-photo based

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) is a new and inherently multi-task problem,
which aims to detect, segment and track each instance in a video sequence.
Existing approaches are mainly based on single-frame features or single-scale
features of multiple frames, where temporal information or multi-scale
information is ignored. To incorporate both temporal and scale information, we
propose a Temporal Pyramid Routing (TPR) strategy to conditionally align and
conduct pixel-level aggregation from a feature pyramid pair of two adjacent
frames. Specifically, TPR contains two novel components, including Dynamic
Aligned Cell Routing (DACR) and Cross Pyramid Routing (CPR), where DACR is
designed for aligning and gating pyramid features across temporal dimension,
while CPR transfers temporally aggregated features across scale dimension.
Moreover, our approach is a plug-and-play module and can be easily applied to
existing instance segmentation methods. Extensive experiments on YouTube-VIS
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach
on several state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods. Codes and trained
models will be publicly available to facilitate future
research.(\url{https://github.com/lxtGH/TemporalPyramidRouting}).]]></summary>

novel view synthesis (NVS) task with multi-view images as input. Existing
neural scene representations for solving the NVS problem, such as NeRF, cannot
generalize to new scenes and take an excessively long time on training on each
new scene from scratch. The other subsequent neural rendering methods based on
stereo matching, such as PixelNeRF, SRF and IBRNet are designed to generalize
to unseen scenes but suffer from view inconsistency in complex scenes with
self-occlusions. To address these issues, our NeuRay method represents every
scene by encoding the visibility of rays associated with the input views. This
neural representation can efficiently be initialized from depths estimated by
external MVS methods, which is able to generalize to new scenes and achieves
satisfactory rendering images without any training on the scene. Then, the
initialized NeuRay can be further optimized on every scene with little training
timing to enforce spatial coherence to ensure view consistency in the presence
of severe self-occlusion. Experiments demonstrate that NeuRay can quickly
generate high-quality novel view images of unseen scenes with little finetuning

camera surveillance, smart environments, and drones necessitates the
improvement of methods for visual active monitoring and control. Traditionally,
the active monitoring task has been handled through a pipeline of modules such
as detection, filtering, and control. However, such methods are difficult to
jointly optimize and tune their various parameters for real-time processing in
resource constraint systems. In this paper a deep Convolutional Camera
Controller Neural Network is proposed to go directly from visual information to
camera movement to provide an efficient solution to the active vision problem.
It is trained end-to-end without bounding box annotations to control a camera
and follow multiple targets from raw pixel values. Evaluation through both a
simulation framework and real experimental setup, indicate that the proposed
solution is robust to varying conditions and able to achieve better monitoring
performance than traditional approaches both in terms of number of targets
monitored as well as in effective monitoring time. The advantage of the
proposed approach is that it is computationally less demanding and can run at
over 10 FPS (~4x speedup) on an embedded smart camera providing a practical and

physical contact, which allows for a wide variety of applications. Deep
learning-based rPPG have demonstrated superior performance over the traditional
approaches in controlled context. However, the lighting situation in indoor
space is typically complex, with uneven light distribution and frequent
variations in illumination. It lacks a fair comparison of different methods
under different illuminations using the same dataset. In this paper, we present
a public dataset, namely the BH-rPPG dataset, which contains data from twelve
subjects under three illuminations: low, medium, and high illumination. We also
provide the ground truth heart rate measured by an oximeter. We evaluate the
performance of three deep learning-based methods to that of four traditional
methods using two public datasets: the UBFC-rPPG dataset and the BH-rPPG
dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that traditional methods are
generally more resistant to fluctuating illuminations. We found that the
rPPGNet achieves lowest MAE among deep learning-based method under medium
illumination, whereas the CHROM achieves 1.5 beats per minute (BPM),
outperforming the rPPGNet by 60%. These findings suggest that while developing
deep learning-based heart rate estimation algorithms, illumination variation
should be taken into account. This work serves as a benchmark for rPPG
performance evaluation and it opens a pathway for future investigation into
deep learning-based rPPG under illumination variations.]]></summary>

detect objects by leveraging perspective geometry, but their performance is
limited due to the absence of accurate depth information. Though this issue can
be alleviated in a depth-based model where a depth estimation module is plugged
to predict depth information before 3D box reasoning, the introduction of such
module dramatically reduces the detection speed. Instead of training a costly
depth estimator, we propose a rendering module to augment the training data by
synthesizing images with virtual-depths. The rendering module takes as input
the RGB image and its corresponding sparse depth image, outputs a variety of
photo-realistic synthetic images, from which the detection model can learn more
discriminative features to adapt to the depth changes of the objects. Besides,
we introduce an auxiliary module to improve the detection model by jointly
optimizing it through a depth estimation task. Both modules are working in the
training time and no extra computation will be introduced to the detection
model. Experiments show that by working with our proposed modules, a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video prediction methods generally consume substantial computing resources in
training and deployment, among which keypoint-based approaches show promising
improvement in efficiency by simplifying dense image prediction to light
keypoint prediction. However, keypoint locations are often modeled only as
continuous coordinates, so noise from semantically insignificant deviations in
videos easily disrupt learning stability, leading to inaccurate keypoint
modeling. In this paper, we design a new grid keypoint learning framework,
aiming at a robust and explainable intermediate keypoint representation for
long-term efficient video prediction. We have two major technical
contributions. First, we detect keypoints by jumping among candidate locations
in our raised grid space and formulate a condensation loss to encourage
meaningful keypoints with strong representative capability. Second, we
introduce a 2D binary map to represent the detected grid keypoints and then
suggest propagating keypoint locations with stochasticity by selecting entries
in the discrete grid space, thus preserving the spatial structure of keypoints
in the longterm horizon for better future frame generation. Extensive
experiments verify that our method outperforms the state-ofthe-art stochastic
video prediction methods while saves more than 98% of computing resources. We
also demonstrate our method on a robotic-assisted surgery dataset with
promising results. Our code is available at

processing, where it aims to generate descriptive legends for images. It is a
two-fold process relying on accurate image understanding and correct language
understanding both syntactically and semantically. It is becoming increasingly
difficult to keep up with the latest research and findings in the field of
image captioning due to the growing amount of knowledge available on the topic.
There is not, however, enough coverage of those findings in the available
review papers. We perform in this paper a run-through of the current
techniques, datasets, benchmarks and evaluation metrics used in image
captioning. The current research on the field is mostly focused on deep
learning-based methods, where attention mechanisms along with deep
reinforcement and adversarial learning appear to be in the forefront of this
research topic. In this paper, we review recent methodologies such as UpDown,
OSCAR, VIVO, Meta Learning and a model that uses conditional generative
adversarial nets. Although the GAN-based model achieves the highest score,
UpDown represents an important basis for image captioning and OSCAR and VIVO
are more useful as they use novel object captioning. This review paper serves
as a roadmap for researchers to keep up to date with the latest contributions
made in the field of image caption generation.]]></summary>

day-time scenario, and their frameworks are driven by warped photometric
consistency. While in some challenging environments, like night, rainy night or
snowy winter, the photometry of the same pixel on different frames is
inconsistent because of the complex lighting and reflection, so that the
day-time unsupervised frameworks cannot be directly applied to these complex
scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised monocular
depth estimation in certain highly complex scenarios. We address this
challenging problem by using domain adaptation, and a unified image
transfer-based adaptation framework is proposed based on monocular videos in
this paper. The depth model trained on day-time scenarios is adapted to
different complex scenarios. Instead of adapting the whole depth network, we
just consider the encoder network for lower computational complexity. The depth
models adapted by the proposed framework to different scenarios share the same
decoder, which is practical. Constraints on both feature space and output space
promote the framework to learn the key features for depth decoding, and the
smoothness loss is introduced into the adaptation framework for better depth
estimation performance. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed unsupervised framework in estimating the dense depth map from the
night-time, rainy night-time and snowy winter images.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image captioning is a task in the field of Artificial Intelligence that
merges between computer vision and natural language processing. It is
responsible for generating legends that describe images, and has various
applications like descriptions used by assistive technology or indexing images
(for search engines for instance). This makes it a crucial topic in AI that is
undergoing a lot of research. This task however, like many others, is trained
on large images labeled via human annotation, which can be very cumbersome: it
needs manual effort, both financial and temporal costs, it is error-prone and
potentially difficult to execute in some cases (e.g. medical images). To
mitigate the need for labels, we attempt to use self-supervised learning, a
type of learning where models use the data contained within the images
themselves as labels. It is challenging to accomplish though, since the task is
two-fold: the images and captions come from two different modalities and
usually handled by different types of networks. It is thus not obvious what a
completely self-supervised solution would look like. How it would achieve
captioning in a comparable way to how self-supervision is applied today on
image recognition tasks is still an ongoing research topic. In this project, we
are using an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder is a convolutional
neural network (CNN) trained on OpenImages dataset and learns image features in
a self-supervised fashion using the rotation pretext task. The decoder is a
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and it is trained, along within the image
captioning model, on MS COCO dataset and is responsible of generating captions.

what examples are challenging for the model, it does not capture the underlying

the benefits of designing a targeted intervention - targeted data augmentation
of the examples where the model is uncertain over the course of training. We
investigate whether the rate of learning in the presence of additional

this is indeed the case, suggesting that well-designed interventions over the

detection in images. Ideally, we expect a perfect reconstruction for normal
samples and poor reconstruction for abnormal samples. Since the
generalizability of deep neural networks is difficult to control, existing
models such as autoencoder do not work well. In this work, we interpret the
reconstruction of an image as a divide-and-assemble procedure. Surprisingly, by
varying the granularity of division on feature maps, we are able to modulate
the reconstruction capability of the model for both normal and abnormal
samples. That is, finer granularity leads to better reconstruction, while
coarser granularity leads to poorer reconstruction. With proper granularity,
the gap between the reconstruction error of normal and abnormal samples can be
maximized. The divide-and-assemble framework is implemented by embedding a
novel multi-scale block-wise memory module into an autoencoder network.
Besides, we introduce adversarial learning and explore the semantic latent
representation of the discriminator, which improves the detection of subtle
anomaly. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the challenging MVTec AD
dataset. Remarkably, we improve the vanilla autoencoder model by 10.1% in terms
of the AUROC score.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Classifying and analyzing human cells is a lengthy procedure, often involving
a trained professional. In an attempt to expedite this process, an active area
of research involves automating cell classification through use of deep
learning-based techniques. In practice, a large amount of data is required to
accurately train these deep learning models. However, due to the sparse human
cell datasets currently available, the performance of these models is typically
low. This study investigates the feasibility of using few-shot learning-based
techniques to mitigate the data requirements for accurate training. The study
is comprised of three parts: First, current state-of-the-art few-shot learning
techniques are evaluated on human cell classification. The selected techniques
are trained on a non-medical dataset and then tested on two out-of-domain,
human cell datasets. The results indicate that, overall, the test accuracy of
state-of-the-art techniques decreased by at least 30% when transitioning from a
non-medical dataset to a medical dataset. Second, this study evaluates the
potential benefits, if any, to varying the backbone architecture and training
schemes in current state-of-the-art few-shot learning techniques when used in
human cell classification. Even with these variations, the overall test
accuracy decreased from 88.66% on non-medical datasets to 44.13% at best on the
medical datasets. Third, this study presents future directions for using
few-shot learning in human cell classification. In general, few-shot learning
in its current state performs poorly on human cell classification. The study
proves that attempts to modify existing network architectures are not effective
and concludes that future research effort should be focused on improving
robustness towards out-of-domain testing using optimization-based or
self-supervised few-shot learning techniques.]]></summary>

enhancement, and color editing. To begin, we study the color correction problem
from the standpoint of the camera's image signal processor (ISP). A camera's
ISP is hardware that applies a series of in-camera image processing and color
manipulation steps, many of which are nonlinear in nature, to render the
initial sensor image to its final photo-finished representation saved in the
8-bit standard RGB (sRGB) color space. As white balance (WB) is one of the
major procedures applied by the ISP for color correction, this thesis presents
two different methods for ISP white balancing. Afterward, we discuss another
scenario of correcting and editing image colors, where we present a set of
methods to correct and edit WB settings for images that have been improperly
white-balanced by the ISP. Then, we explore another factor that has a
significant impact on the quality of camera-rendered colors, in which we
outline two different methods to correct exposure errors in camera-rendered
images. Lastly, we discuss post-capture auto color editing and manipulation. In
particular, we propose auto image recoloring methods to generate different
realistic versions of the same camera-rendered image with new colors. Through
extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our methods provide superior
solutions compared to existing alternatives targeting color correction, color
enhancement, and color editing.]]></summary>

(i) context and line segments encoders, (ii) a structure-guided plane decoder,

specially designed encoders and then feeds them into a Transformers-based
decoder to directly predict a sequence of plane instances by simultaneously
considering the context and global structure cues. Finally, the pixel-wise

without using supervisions of object location and human pose. We name it
detection-free HOI recognition, in contrast to the existing
detection-supervised approaches which rely on object and keypoint detections to
achieve state of the art. With our method, not only the detection supervision
is evitable, but superior performance can be achieved by properly using
image-text pre-training (such as CLIP) and the proposed Log-Sum-Exp Sign
(LSE-Sign) loss function. Specifically, using text embeddings of class labels
to initialize the linear classifier is essential for leveraging the CLIP
pre-trained image encoder. In addition, LSE-Sign loss facilitates learning from
multiple labels on an imbalanced dataset by normalizing gradients over all
classes in a softmax format. Surprisingly, our detection-free solution achieves
60.5 mAP on the HICO dataset, outperforming the detection-supervised state of
the art by 13.4 mAP]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zero-shot action recognition is the task of classifying action categories
that are not available in the training set. In this setting, the standard
evaluation protocol is to use existing action recognition datasets (e.g.
UCF101) and randomly split the classes into seen and unseen. However, most
recent work builds on representations pre-trained on the Kinetics dataset,
where classes largely overlap with classes in the zero-shot evaluation
datasets. As a result, classes which are supposed to be unseen, are present
during supervised pre-training, invalidating the condition of the zero-shot
setting. A similar concern was previously noted several years ago for image
based zero-shot recognition, but has not been considered by the zero-shot
action recognition community. In this paper, we propose a new split for true
zero-shot action recognition with no overlap between unseen test classes and
training or pre-training classes. We benchmark several recent approaches on the
proposed True Zero-Shot (TruZe) Split for UCF101 and HMDB51, with zero-shot and
generalized zero-shot evaluation. In our extensive analysis we find that our
TruZe splits are significantly harder than comparable random splits as nothing
is leaking from pre-training, i.e. unseen performance is consistently lower, up
to 9.4% for zero-shot action recognition. In an additional evaluation we also
find that similar issues exist in the splits used in few-shot action
recognition, here we see differences of up to 14.1%. We publish our splits and
hope that our benchmark analysis will change how the field is evaluating zero-
and few-shot action recognition moving forward.]]></summary>

However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as
long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has
quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence
length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an
efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear
complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range
attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a
short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a
dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two
attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and
bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains,
including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and
ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on
enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being
faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its
full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the
state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained
on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more
scalable on high-resolution images. The source code and models are released at

to tasks that could benefit from extra capacity. Using our large-scale MTL

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper argues that training GANs on local and non-local dependencies in
speech data offers insights into how deep neural networks discretize continuous
data and how symbolic-like rule-based morphophonological processes emerge in a
deep convolutional architecture. Acquisition of speech has recently been
modeled as a dependency between latent space and data generated by GANs in
Begu\v{s} (2020b; arXiv:2006.03965), who models learning of a simple local
allophonic distribution. We extend this approach to test learning of local and
non-local phonological processes that include approximations of morphological
processes. We further parallel outputs of the model to results of a behavioral
experiment where human subjects are trained on the data used for training the
GAN network. Four main conclusions emerge: (i) the networks provide useful
information for computational models of speech acquisition even if trained on a
comparatively small dataset of an artificial grammar learning experiment; (ii)
local processes are easier to learn than non-local processes, which matches
both behavioral data in human subjects and typology in the world's languages.
This paper also proposes (iii) how we can actively observe the network's
progress in learning and explore the effect of training steps on learning
representations by keeping latent space constant across different training
steps. Finally, this paper shows that (iv) the network learns to encode the
presence of a prefix with a single latent variable; by interpolating this
variable, we can actively observe the operation of a non-local phonological
process. The proposed technique for retrieving learning representations has
general implications for our understanding of how GANs discretize continuous
speech data and suggests that rule-like generalizations in the training data
are represented as an interaction between variables in the network's latent
space.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Robustness against word substitutions has a well-defined and widely
acceptable form, i.e., using semantically similar words as substitutions, and
thus it is considered as a fundamental stepping-stone towards broader
robustness in natural language processing. Previous defense methods capture
word substitutions in vector space by using either $l_2$-ball or
hyper-rectangle, which results in perturbation sets that are not inclusive
enough or unnecessarily large, and thus impedes mimicry of worst cases for
robust training. In this paper, we introduce a novel \textit{Adversarial Sparse
Convex Combination} (ASCC) method. We model the word substitution attack space
as a convex hull and leverages a regularization term to enforce perturbation
towards an actual substitution, thus aligning our modeling better with the
discrete textual space. Based on the ASCC method, we further propose
ASCC-defense, which leverages ASCC to generate worst-case perturbations and
incorporates adversarial training towards robustness. Experiments show that
ASCC-defense outperforms the current state-of-the-arts in terms of robustness
on two prevailing NLP tasks, \emph{i.e.}, sentiment analysis and natural
language inference, concerning several attacks across multiple model
architectures. Besides, we also envision a new class of defense towards
robustness in NLP, where our robustly trained word vectors can be plugged into
a normally trained model and enforce its robustness without applying any other
defense techniques.]]></summary>

multiple languages using self-supervised learning (SSL) and applying these for
automatic speech recognition. There is an abundance of unannotated speech, so
creating self-supervised representations from raw audio and finetuning on a
small annotated datasets is a promising direction to build speech recognition
systems. Wav2vec models perform SSL on raw audio in a pretraining phase and
then finetune on a small fraction of annotated data. SSL models have produced
state of the art results for ASR. However, these models are very expensive to
pretrain with self-supervision. We tackle the problem of learning new language
representations continually from audio without forgetting a previous language
representation. We use ideas from continual learning to transfer knowledge from
a previous task to speed up pretraining a new language task. Our
continual-wav2vec2 model can decrease pretraining times by 32% when learning a
new language task, and learn this new audio-language representation without
forgetting previous language representation.]]></summary>

pre-trained ones (e.g., BART and T5), have exhibited compelling performance on
various natural language generation tasks. However, the black-box nature of
these models limits their application in tasks where specific rules (e.g.,
controllable constraints, prior knowledge) need to be executed. Previous works
either design specific model structure (e.g., Copy Mechanism corresponding to
the rule "the generated output should include certain words in the source
input") or implement specialized inference algorithm (e.g., Constrained Beam
Search) to execute particular rules through the text generation. These methods
require careful design case-by-case and are difficult to support multiple rules
concurrently. In this paper, we propose a novel module named Neural
Rule-Execution Tracking Machine that can be equipped into various
transformer-based generators to leverage multiple rules simultaneously to guide
the neural generation model for superior generation performance in a unified
and scalable way. Extensive experimental results on several benchmarks verify
the effectiveness of our proposed model in both controllable and general text

than an individual could glean from their own experience in a lifetime.
Cultural knowledge in turn rests on language: language is the richest record of
what previous generations believed, valued, and practiced. The power and
mechanisms of language as a means of cultural learning, however, are not well
understood. We take a first step towards reverse-engineering cultural learning
through language. We developed a suite of complex high-stakes tasks in the form
of minimalist-style video games, which we deployed in an iterated learning
paradigm. Game participants were limited to only two attempts (two lives) to
beat each game and were allowed to write a message to a future participant who
read the message before playing. Knowledge accumulated gradually across
generations, allowing later generations to advance further in the games and
perform more efficient actions. Multigenerational learning followed a
strikingly similar trajectory to individuals learning alone with an unlimited
number of lives. These results suggest that language provides a sufficient
medium to express and accumulate the knowledge people acquire in these diverse
tasks: the dynamics of the environment, valuable goals, dangerous risks, and
strategies for success. The video game paradigm we pioneer here is thus a rich
test bed for theories of cultural transmission and learning from language.]]></summary>

from a corpus in response to a query. Although the most common formulation of
text ranking is search, instances of the task can also be found in many natural
language processing applications. This survey provides an overview of text
ranking with neural network architectures known as transformers, of which BERT
is the best-known example. The combination of transformers and self-supervised
pretraining has been responsible for a paradigm shift in natural language
processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR), and beyond. In this survey, we
provide a synthesis of existing work as a single point of entry for
practitioners who wish to gain a better understanding of how to apply
transformers to text ranking problems and researchers who wish to pursue work
in this area. We cover a wide range of modern techniques, grouped into two
high-level categories: transformer models that perform reranking in multi-stage
architectures and dense retrieval techniques that perform ranking directly.
There are two themes that pervade our survey: techniques for handling long
documents, beyond typical sentence-by-sentence processing in NLP, and
techniques for addressing the tradeoff between effectiveness (i.e., result
quality) and efficiency (e.g., query latency, model and index size). Although
transformer architectures and pretraining techniques are recent innovations,
many aspects of how they are applied to text ranking are relatively well
understood and represent mature techniques. However, there remain many open
research questions, and thus in addition to laying out the foundations of
pretrained transformers for text ranking, this survey also attempts to
prognosticate where the field is heading.]]></summary>

have restricted receptive field. To address the above limitations, we propose a
multi-scale feature and metric learning framework for relation extraction.
Specifically, we first develop a multi-scale convolutional neural network to
aggregate the non-successive mainstays in the lexical sequence. We also design
a multi-scale graph convolutional network which can increase the receptive
field towards specific syntactic roles. Moreover, we present a multi-scale
metric learning paradigm to exploit both the feature-level relation between
lexical and syntactic features and the sample-level relation between instances
with the same or different classes. We conduct extensive experiments on three

human speech into raw acoustic data? This paper proposes two neural network
architectures for modeling unsupervised lexical learning from raw acoustic
inputs, ciwGAN (Categorical InfoWaveGAN) and fiwGAN (Featural InfoWaveGAN),
that combine a Deep Convolutional GAN architecture for audio data (WaveGAN;
arXiv:1705.07904) with an information theoretic extension of GAN -- InfoGAN
(arXiv:1606.03657), and propose a new latent space structure that can model
featural learning simultaneously with a higher level classification and allows
for a very low-dimension vector representation of lexical items. Lexical
learning is modeled as emergent from an architecture that forces a deep neural
network to output data such that unique information is retrievable from its
acoustic outputs. The networks trained on lexical items from TIMIT learn to
encode unique information corresponding to lexical items in the form of
categorical variables in their latent space. By manipulating these variables,
the network outputs specific lexical items. The network occasionally outputs
innovative lexical items that violate training data, but are linguistically
interpretable and highly informative for cognitive modeling and neural network
interpretability. Innovative outputs suggest that phonetic and phonological
representations learned by the network can be productively recombined and
directly paralleled to productivity in human speech: a fiwGAN network trained
on `suit' and `dark' outputs innovative `start', even though it never saw
`start' or even a [st] sequence in the training data. We also argue that
setting latent featural codes to values well beyond training range results in
almost categorical generation of prototypical lexical items and reveals
underlying values of each latent code.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains.
However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as
long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has
quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence
length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an
efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear
complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range
attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a
short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a
dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two
attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and
bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains,
including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and
ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on
enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being
faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its
full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the
state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained
on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more
scalable on high-resolution images. The source code and models are released at

complementary information to each other that may not be evident when working
with individual modalities on their own. In this context, multi-modal models
can help producing more accurate and robust predictions in machine learning
tasks where audio-visual data is available. This paper presents a multi-modal
model for automatic scene classification that exploits simultaneously auditory
and visual information. The proposed approach makes use of two separate
networks which are respectively trained in isolation on audio and visual data,
so that each network specializes in a given modality. The visual subnetwork is
a pre-trained VGG16 model followed by a bidiretional recurrent layer, while the
residual audio subnetwork is based on stacked squeeze-excitation convolutional
blocks trained from scratch. After training each subnetwork, the fusion of
information from the audio and visual streams is performed at two different
stages. The early fusion stage combines features resulting from the last
convolutional block of the respective subnetworks at different time steps to
feed a bidirectional recurrent structure. The late fusion stage combines the
output of the early fusion stage with the independent predictions provided by
the two subnetworks, resulting in the final prediction. We evaluate the method
using the recently published TAU Audio-Visual Urban Scenes 2021, which contains
synchronized audio and video recordings from 12 European cities in 10 different
scene classes. The proposed model has been shown to provide an excellent
trade-off between prediction performance (86.5%) and system complexity (15M
parameters) in the evaluation results of the DCASE 2021 Challenge.]]></summary>

approach with the inherent conditional and label shifts, in which we aim to
align the distributions w.r.t. both $p(x|y)$ and $p(y)$. Since the label is
inaccessible in the target domain, the conventional adversarial UDA assumes
$p(y)$ is invariant across domains, and relies on aligning $p(x)$ as an
alternative to the $p(x|y)$ alignment. To address this, we provide a thorough
theoretical and empirical analysis of the conventional adversarial UDA methods
under both conditional and label shifts, and propose a novel and practical
alternative optimization scheme for adversarial UDA. Specifically, we infer the
marginal $p(y)$ and align $p(x|y)$ iteratively in the training, and precisely
align the posterior $p(y|x)$ in testing. Our experimental results demonstrate
its effectiveness on both classification and segmentation UDA, and partial UDA.]]></summary>

standard jointly developed by ITU-T and ISO/IEC, which has been finalized in
July 2020. VVC allows for significant bit-rate reductions around 50% for the
same subjective video quality compared to its predecessor, High Efficiency
Video Coding (HEVC). One year after finalization, VVC support in devices and
chipsets is still under development, which is aligned with the typical
development cycles of new video coding standards. This paper presents
open-source software packages that allow building a complete VVC end-to-end
toolchain already one year after its finalization. This includes the Fraunhofer
HHI VVenC library for fast and efficient VVC encoding as well as HHI's VVdeC
library for live decoding. An experimental integration of VVC in the GPAC
software tools and FFmpeg media framework allows packaging VVC bitstreams, e.g.
encoded with VVenC, in MP4 file format and using DASH for content creation and
streaming. The integration of VVdeC allows playback on the receiver. Given
these packages, step-by-step tutorials are provided for two possible
application scenarios: VVC file encoding plus playback and adaptive streaming

extensive catalogs of media providers. To avoid the user examining all the
results, its preferences are used to provide a subset of relatively small size.
The user preferences can be inferred from the interactions with the presented
content if explicit ratings are unavailable. However, directly using implicit
feedback can lead to learning wrong relevance models and is known as biased
LTR. The mismatch between implicit feedback and true relevances is due to
various nuisances, with position bias one of the most relevant. Position bias
models consider that the lack of interaction with a presented item is not only
attributed to the item being irrelevant but because the item was not examined.
This paper introduces a method for modeling the probability of an item being
seen in different contexts, e.g., for different users, with a single estimator.
Our suggested method, denoted as contextual (EM)-based regression, is
ranker-agnostic and able to correctly learn the latent examination
probabilities while only using implicit feedback. Our empirical results
indicate that the method introduced in this paper outperforms other existing
position bias estimators in terms of relative error when the examination
probability varies across queries. Moreover, the estimated values provide a
ranking performance boost when used to debias the implicit ranking data even if
there is no context dependency on the examination probabilities.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A great challenge to steganography has arisen with the wide application of
steganalysis methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To this
end, embedding cost learning frameworks based on generative adversarial
networks (GANs) have been proposed and achieved success for spatial
steganography. However, the application of GAN to JPEG steganography is still
in the prototype stage; its anti-detectability and training efficiency should
be improved. In conventional steganography, research has shown that the
side-information calculated from the precover can be used to enhance security.
However, it is hard to calculate the side-information without the spatial
domain image. In this work, an embedding cost learning framework for JPEG
Steganography via a Generative Adversarial Network (JS-GAN) has been proposed,
the learned embedding cost can be further adjusted asymmetrically according to
the estimated side-information. Experimental results have demonstrated that the
proposed method can automatically learn a content-adaptive embedding cost
function, and use the estimated side-information properly can effectively
improve the security performance. For example, under the attack of a classic
steganalyzer GFR with quality factor 75 and 0.4 bpnzAC, the proposed JS-GAN can
increase the detection error 2.58% over J-UNIWARD, and the estimated
side-information aided version JS-GAN(ESI) can further increase the security
performance by 11.25% over JS-GAN.]]></summary>

systems (FRS). In federated learning (FL), the global model payload that is
moved between the server and users depends on the number of items to recommend.
The model payload grows when there is an increasing number of items. This
becomes challenging for an FRS if it is running in production mode. To tackle
the payload challenge, we formulated a multi-arm bandit solution that selected
part of the global model and transmitted it to all users. The selection process
was guided by a novel reward function suitable for FL systems. So far as we are
aware, this is the first optimization method that seeks to address item
dependent payloads. The method was evaluated using three benchmark
recommendation datasets. The empirical validation confirmed that the proposed
method outperforms the simpler methods that do not benefit from the bandits for
the purpose of item selection. In addition, we have demonstrated the usefulness
of our proposed method by rigorously evaluating the effects of a payload
reduction on the recommendation performance degradation. Our method achieved up
to a 90\% reduction in model payload, yielding only a $\sim$4\% - 8\% loss in
the recommendation performance for highly sparse datasets]]></summary>

from a corpus in response to a query. Although the most common formulation of
text ranking is search, instances of the task can also be found in many natural
language processing applications. This survey provides an overview of text
ranking with neural network architectures known as transformers, of which BERT
is the best-known example. The combination of transformers and self-supervised
pretraining has been responsible for a paradigm shift in natural language
processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR), and beyond. In this survey, we
provide a synthesis of existing work as a single point of entry for
practitioners who wish to gain a better understanding of how to apply
transformers to text ranking problems and researchers who wish to pursue work
in this area. We cover a wide range of modern techniques, grouped into two
high-level categories: transformer models that perform reranking in multi-stage
architectures and dense retrieval techniques that perform ranking directly.
There are two themes that pervade our survey: techniques for handling long
documents, beyond typical sentence-by-sentence processing in NLP, and
techniques for addressing the tradeoff between effectiveness (i.e., result
quality) and efficiency (e.g., query latency, model and index size). Although
transformer architectures and pretraining techniques are recent innovations,
many aspects of how they are applied to text ranking are relatively well
understood and represent mature techniques. However, there remain many open
research questions, and thus in addition to laying out the foundations of
pretrained transformers for text ranking, this survey also attempts to
prognosticate where the field is heading.]]></summary>

similarities using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have gained significant
attention in recent years. This is, in part, because ANNs have demonstrated
good results in a wide variety of recommendation tasks. The introduction of
ANNs within the recommendation ecosystem has been recently questioned, raising
several comparisons in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. One aspect most
of these comparisons have in common is their focus on accuracy, neglecting
other evaluation dimensions important for the recommendation, such as novelty,
diversity, or accounting for biases. We replicate experiments from three papers
that compare Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) and Matrix Factorization
(MF), to extend the analysis to other evaluation dimensions. Our contribution
shows that the experiments are entirely reproducible, and we extend the study
including other accuracy metrics and two statistical hypothesis tests. We
investigated the Diversity and Novelty of the recommendations, showing that MF
provides a better accuracy also on the long tail, although NCF provides a
better item coverage and more diversified recommendations. We discuss the bias
effect generated by the tested methods. They show a relatively small bias, but
other recommendation baselines, with competitive accuracy performance,
consistently show to be less affected by this issue. This is the first work, to
the best of our knowledge, where several evaluation dimensions have been
explored for an array of SOTA algorithms covering recent adaptations of ANNs
and MF. Hence, we show the potential these techniques may have on
beyond-accuracy evaluation while analyzing the effect on reproducibility these
complementary dimensions may spark. Available at

approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search problem. Currently, graph-based ANN
search algorithms are designed mainly using heuristics, whereas theoretical
analysis of such algorithms is quite lacking. In this paper, we study a
fundamental model of proximity graphs used in graph-based ANN search, called
Monotonic Relative Neighborhood Graph (MRNG), from a theoretical perspective.
We use mathematical proofs to explain why proximity graphs that are built based
on MRNG tend to have good searching performance. We also run experiments on
MRNG and graphs generalizing MRNG to obtain a deeper understanding of the
model. Our experiments give guidance on how to approximate and generalize MRNG
to build proximity graphs on a large scale. In addition, we discover and study

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the present time, sequential item recommendation models are compared by
calculating metrics on a small item subset (target set) to speed up
computation. The target set contains the relevant item and a set of negative
items that are sampled from the full item set. Two well-known strategies to
sample negative items are uniform random sampling and sampling by popularity to
better approximate the item frequency distribution in the dataset. Most
recently published papers on sequential item recommendation rely on sampling by
popularity to compare the evaluated models. However, recent work has already
shown that an evaluation with uniform random sampling may not be consistent
with the full ranking, that is, the model ranking obtained by evaluating a
metric using the full item set as target set, which raises the question whether
the ranking obtained by sampling by popularity is equal to the full ranking. In
this work, we re-evaluate current state-of-the-art sequential recommender
models from the point of view, whether these sampling strategies have an impact
on the final ranking of the models. We therefore train four recently proposed
sequential recommendation models on five widely known datasets. For each
dataset and model, we employ three evaluation strategies. First, we compute the
full model ranking. Then we evaluate all models on a target set sampled by the
two different sampling strategies, uniform random sampling and sampling by
popularity with the commonly used target set size of 100, compute the model
ranking for each strategy and compare them with each other. Additionally, we
vary the size of the sampled target set. Overall, we find that both sampling
strategies can produce inconsistent rankings compared with the full ranking of
the models. Furthermore, both sampling by popularity and uniform random
sampling do not consistently produce the same ranking ...]]></summary>

generalization ability of deep learning models. Regional dropout is one of the
popular solutions that guides the model to focus on less discriminative parts
by randomly removing image regions, resulting in improved regularization.
However, such information removal is undesirable. On the other hand, recent
strategies suggest to randomly cut and mix patches and their labels among
training images, to enjoy the advantages of regional dropout without having any
pointless pixel in the augmented images. We argue that such random selection
strategies of the patches may not necessarily represent sufficient information
about the corresponding object and thereby mixing the labels according to that
uninformative patch enables the model to learn unexpected feature
representation. Therefore, we propose SaliencyMix that carefully selects a
representative image patch with the help of a saliency map and mixes this
indicative patch with the target image, thus leading the model to learn more
appropriate feature representation. SaliencyMix achieves the best known top-1
error of 21.26% and 20.09% for ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 architectures on
ImageNet classification, respectively, and also improves the model robustness
against adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, models that are trained with
SaliencyMix help to improve the object detection performance. Source code is

are allowed to communicate. The MAS runs over an underlying Markov decision
process and its task is to maximize the averaged sum of discounted one-stage
rewards. Although knowing the global state of the environment is necessary for
the optimal action selection of the MAS, agents are limited to individual
observations. The inter-agent communication can tackle the issue of local
observability, however, the limited rate of the inter-agent communication
prevents the agent from acquiring the precise global state information. To
overcome this challenge, agents need to communicate their observations in a
compact way such that the MAS compromises the minimum possible sum of rewards.
We show that this problem is equivalent to a form of rate-distortion problem
which we call the task-based information compression. We introduce a scheme for
task-based information compression titled State aggregation for information
compression (SAIC), for which a state aggregation algorithm is analytically
designed. The SAIC is shown to be capable of achieving near-optimal performance
in terms of the achieved sum of discounted rewards. The proposed algorithm is
applied to a rendezvous problem and its performance is compared with several
benchmarks. Numerical experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, the problem of inaccurate learning targets in crowd counting draws
increasing attention. Inspired by a few pioneering work, we solve this problem
by trying to predict the indices of pre-defined interval bins of counts instead
of the count values themselves. However, an inappropriate interval setting
might make the count error contributions from different intervals extremely
imbalanced, leading to inferior counting performance. Therefore, we propose a
novel count interval partition criterion called Uniform Error Partition (UEP),
which always keeps the expected counting error contributions equal for all
intervals to minimize the prediction risk. Then to mitigate the inevitably
introduced discretization errors in the count quantization process, we propose
another criterion called Mean Count Proxies (MCP). The MCP criterion selects
the best count proxy for each interval to represent its count value during
inference, making the overall expected discretization error of an image nearly
negligible. As far as we are aware, this work is the first to delve into such a
classification task and ends up with a promising solution for count interval
partition. Following the above two theoretically demonstrated criterions, we
propose a simple yet effective model termed Uniform Error Partition Network
(UEPNet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging
datasets. The codes will be available at:

have shown their utility in distributed reinforcement learning (RL).
Unfortunately, in the gradient estimation process, almost all of them require
random samples with the same dimension as the global variable and/or require
evaluation of the global cost function, which may induce high estimation
variance for large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose a novel
distributed zeroth-order algorithm by leveraging the network structure inherent
in the optimization objective, which allows each agent to estimate its local
gradient by local cost evaluation independently, without use of any consensus
protocol. The proposed algorithm exhibits an asynchronous update scheme, and is
designed for stochastic non-convex optimization with a possibly non-convex
feasible domain based on the block coordinate descent method. The algorithm is
later employed as a distributed model-free RL algorithm for distributed linear
quadratic regulator design, where a learning graph is designed to describe the
required interaction relationship among agents in distributed learning. We
provide an empirical validation of the proposed algorithm to benchmark its
performance on convergence rate and variance against a centralized ZOO
algorithm.]]></summary>

presence of `confounders', covariates that affect both treatment assignment and
the outcome. To address this challenge, practitioners collect and adjust for
the covariates, hoping that they adequately correct for confounding. However,
including every observed covariate in the adjustment runs the risk of including
`bad controls', variables that induce bias when they are conditioned on. The
problem is that we do not always know which variables in the covariate set are
safe to adjust for and which are not. To address this problem, we develop
Nearly Invariant Causal Estimation (NICE). NICE uses invariant risk
minimization (IRM) [Arj19] to learn a representation of the covariates that,
under some assumptions, strips out bad controls but preserves sufficient
information to adjust for confounding. Adjusting for the learned
representation, rather than the covariates themselves, avoids the induced bias
and provides valid causal inferences. We evaluate NICE on both synthetic and
semi-synthetic data. When the covariates contain unknown collider variables and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We demonstrate that matching the symmetry properties of a reservoir computer
(RC) to the data being processed dramatically increases its processing power.
We apply our method to the parity task, a challenging benchmark problem that
highlights inversion and permutation symmetries, and to a chaotic system
inference task that presents an inversion symmetry rule. For the parity task,
our symmetry-aware RC obtains zero error using an exponentially reduced neural
network and training data, greatly speeding up the time to result and
outperforming hand crafted artificial neural networks. When both symmetries are
respected, we find that the network size $N$ necessary to obtain zero error for
50 different RC instances scales linearly with the parity-order $n$. Moreover,
some symmetry-aware RC instances perform a zero error classification with only
$N=1$ for $n\leq7$. Furthermore, we show that a symmetry-aware RC only needs a
training data set with size on the order of $(n+n/2)$ to obtain such
performance, an exponential reduction in comparison to a regular RC which
requires a training data set with size on the order of $n2^n$ to contain all
$2^n$ possible $n-$bit-long sequences. For the inference task, we show that a
symmetry-aware RC presents a normalized root-mean-square error three
orders-of-magnitude smaller than regular RCs. For both tasks, our RC approach
respects the symmetries by adjusting only the input and the output layers, and
not by problem-based modifications to the neural network. We anticipate that
generalizations of our procedure can be applied in information processing for
problems with known symmetries.]]></summary>

impairments, holding a paintbrush to create a work is a very difficult task.
People in this special group are eager to pick up the paintbrush, like Leonardo
da Vinci, to create and make full use of their own talents. Therefore, to
maximally bridge this gap, we propose a painting navigation system to assist
blind people in painting and artistic creation. The proposed system is composed
of cognitive system and guidance system. The system adopts drawing board
positioning based on QR code, brush navigation based on target detection and
bush real-time positioning. Meanwhile, this paper uses human-computer
interaction on the basis of voice and a simple but efficient position
information coding rule. In addition, we design a criterion to efficiently
judge whether the brush reaches the target or not. According to the
experimental results, the thermal curves extracted from the faces of testers
show that it is relatively well accepted by blindfolded and even blind testers.
With the prompt frequency of 1s, the painting navigation system performs best
with the completion degree of 89% with SD of 8.37% and overflow degree of 347%
with SD of 162.14%. Meanwhile, the excellent and good types of brush tip
trajectory account for 74%, and the relative movement distance is 4.21 with SD
of 2.51. This work demonstrates that it is practicable for the blind people to
feel the world through the brush in their hands. In the future, we plan to
deploy Angle's Eyes on the phone to make it more portable. The demo video of
the proposed painting navigation system is available at:

distribution, have become a common problem affecting data quality. Big Data
scenarios pose a new challenge to traditional imbalanced classification
algorithms, since they are not prepared to work with such amount of data. Split
data strategies and lack of data in the minority class due to the use of
MapReduce paradigm have posed new challenges for tackling the imbalance between
classes in Big Data scenarios. Ensembles have shown to be able to successfully
address imbalanced data problems. Smart Data refers to data of enough quality
to achieve high performance models. The combination of ensembles and Smart
Data, achieved through Big Data preprocessing, should be a great synergy. In
this paper, we propose a novel methodology based on Decision Trees Ensemble
with Smart Data for addressing the imbalanced classification problem in Big
Data domains, namely DeTE_SD methodology. This methodology is based on the
learning of different decision trees using distributed quality data for the
ensemble process. This quality data is achieved by fusing Random
Discretization, Principal Components Analysis and clustering-based Random
Oversampling for obtaining different Smart Data versions of the original data.
Experiments carried out in 21 binary adapted datasets have shown that our
methodology outperforms Random Forest.]]></summary>

retrieval are among the key challenges faced by practical deployments of
biometric identification systems worldwide. In this work, a method of protected
indexing of biometric data is presented. By utilising feature-level fusion of
intelligently paired templates, a multi-stage search structure is created.
During retrieval, the list of potential candidate identities is successively
pre-filtered, thereby reducing the number of template comparisons necessary for
a biometric identification transaction. Protection of the biometric probe
templates, as well as the stored reference templates and the created index is
carried out using homomorphic encryption. The proposed method is extensively
evaluated in closed-set and open-set identification scenarios on publicly
available databases using two state-of-the-art open-source face recognition
systems. With respect to a typical baseline algorithm utilising an exhaustive
search-based retrieval algorithm, the proposed method enables a reduction of
the computational workload associated with a biometric identification
transaction by 90%, while simultaneously suffering no degradation of the
biometric performance. Furthermore, by facilitating a seamless integration of
template protection with open-source homomorphic encryption libraries, the
proposed method guarantees unlinkability, irreversibility, and renewability of

intelligence (AI) have led to the development of challenging tasks at the
intersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Embodied AI.
Whereas many approaches and previous survey pursuits have characterised one or
two of these dimensions, there has not been a holistic analysis at the center
of all three. Moreover, even when combinations of these topics are considered,
more focus is placed on describing, e.g., current architectural methods, as
opposed to also illustrating high-level challenges and opportunities for the
field. In this survey paper, we discuss Embodied Vision-Language Planning
(EVLP) tasks, a family of prominent embodied navigation and manipulation
problems that jointly use computer vision and natural language. We propose a
taxonomy to unify these tasks and provide an in-depth analysis and comparison
of the new and current algorithmic approaches, metrics, simulated environments,
as well as the datasets used for EVLP tasks. Finally, we present the core
challenges that we believe new EVLP works should seek to address, and we

from conic integral geometry. X-REGO randomly projects, in a sequential or

subproblems that can then be solved with any global, or even local,
optimization solver. We estimate the probability that the randomly-embedded
subproblem shares (approximately) the same global optimum as the original

an approximate global solution of the original problem, under weak assumptions
on the problem (having a strictly feasible global solution) and on the solver
(guaranteed to find an approximate global solution of the reduced problem with
sufficiently high probability). In the particular case of unconstrained
objectives with low effective dimension, that only vary over a low-dimensional
subspace, we propose an X-REGO variant that explores random subspaces of
increasing dimension until finding the effective dimension of the problem,
leading to X-REGO globally converging after a finite number of embeddings,
proportional to the effective dimension. We show numerically that this variant

and expressive speech synthesis at scale. It does not require the target
speakers to be experts in expressing all styles and to collect corresponding
recordings for model training. However, the performances of existing style
transfer methods are still far behind real application needs. The root causes
are mainly twofold. Firstly, the style embedding extracted from single
reference speech can hardly provide fine-grained and appropriate prosody
information for arbitrary text to synthesize. Secondly, in these models the
content/text, prosody, and speaker timbre are usually highly entangled, it's
therefore not realistic to expect a satisfied result when freely combining
these components, such as to transfer speaking style between speakers. In this
paper, we propose a cross-speaker style transfer text-to-speech (TTS) model
with explicit prosody bottleneck. The prosody bottleneck builds up the kernels
accounting for speaking style robustly, and disentangles the prosody from
content and speaker timbre, therefore guarantees high quality cross-speaker
style transfer. Evaluation result shows the proposed method even achieves
on-par performance with source speaker's speaker-dependent (SD) model in
objective measurement of prosody, and significantly outperforms the cycle
consistency and GMVAE-based baselines in objective and subjective evaluations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Empirically it has been observed that the performance of deep neural networks
steadily improves as we increase model size, contradicting the classical view
on overfitting and generalization. Recently, the double descent phenomena has
been proposed to reconcile this observation with theory, suggesting that the
test error has a second descent when the model becomes sufficiently
overparameterized, as the model size itself acts as an implicit regularizer. In
this paper we add to the growing body of work in this space, providing a
careful study of learning dynamics as a function of model size for the least
squares scenario. We show an excess risk bound for the gradient descent
solution of the least squares objective. The bound depends on the smallest
non-zero eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of the input features, via a
functional form that has the double descent behavior. This gives a new
perspective on the double descent curves reported in the literature. Our
analysis of the excess risk allows to decouple the effect of optimization and
generalization error. In particular, we find that in case of noiseless
regression, double descent is explained solely by optimization-related
quantities, which was missed in studies focusing on the Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse solution. We believe that our derivation provides an alternative
view compared to existing work, shedding some light on a possible cause of this
phenomena, at least in the considered least squares setting. We empirically
explore if our predictions hold for neural networks, in particular whether the
covariance of intermediary hidden activations has a similar behavior as the one
predicted by our derivations.]]></summary>

particular universality class of phase transitions in statistical physics. We
then show that the artificial neurone is, mathematically, a mean field model of
biological neural membrane dynamics, which arises from modelling spiking as a
phase transition. This allows us to treat selective neural firing in an
abstract way, and formalise the role of the activation function in perceptron
learning. The resultant statistical physical model allows us to recover the
expressions for some known activation functions as various special cases. Along
with deriving this model and specifying the analogous neural case, we analyse
the phase transition to understand the physics of neural network learning.
Together, it is shown that there is not only a biological meaning, but a
physical justification, for the emergence and performance of typical activation
functions; implications for neural learning and inference are also discussed.]]></summary>

development process to get a first possible geometry design. The
state-of-the-art is the iterative calculation, which requires both time and
computational power. Some newly developed methods use artificial intelligence
to accelerate the topology optimization. These require conventionally
pre-optimized data and therefore are dependent on the quality and number of
available data. This paper proposes an AI-assisted design method for topology
optimization, which does not require pre-optimized data. The designs are
provided by an artificial neural network, the predictor, on the basis of
boundary conditions and degree of filling (the volume percentage filled by
material) as input data. In the training phase, geometries generated on the
basis of random input data are evaluated with respect to given criteria. The
results of those evaluations flow into an objective function which is minimized
by adapting the predictor's parameters. After the training is completed, the
presented AI-assisted design procedure supplies geometries which are similar to
the ones generated by conventional topology optimizers, but requires a small
fraction of the computational effort required by those algorithms. We
anticipate our paper to be a starting point for AI-based methods that requires
data, that is hard to compute or not available.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motivation: Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET) is a 3D bioimaging tool that
visualizes the structural and spatial organization of macromolecules at a
near-native state in single cells, which has broad applications in life
science. However, the systematic structural recognition and recovery of
macromolecules captured by cryo-ET are difficult due to high structural
complexity and imaging limits. Deep learning based subtomogram classification
have played critical roles for such tasks. As supervised approaches, however,
their performance relies on sufficient and laborious annotation on a large
training dataset.

Results: To alleviate this major labeling burden, we proposed a Hybrid Active
Learning (HAL) framework for querying subtomograms for labelling from a large
unlabeled subtomogram pool. Firstly, HAL adopts uncertainty sampling to select
the subtomograms that have the most uncertain predictions. Moreover, to
mitigate the sampling bias caused by such strategy, a discriminator is
introduced to judge if a certain subtomogram is labeled or unlabeled and
subsequently the model queries the subtomogram that have higher probabilities
to be unlabeled. Additionally, HAL introduces a subset sampling strategy to
improve the diversity of the query set, so that the information overlap is
decreased between the queried batches and the algorithmic efficiency is
improved. Our experiments on subtomogram classification tasks using both
simulated and real data demonstrate that we can achieve comparable testing
performance (on average only 3% accuracy drop) by using less than 30% of the
labeled subtomograms, which shows a very promising result for subtomogram
classification task with limited labeling resources.]]></summary>

decision making problems, making them popular tools to deliver personalized
interventions in mobile health as well as other health applications. However,
when bandits are deployed in the context of a scientific study -- e.g. a
clinical trial to test if a mobile health intervention is effective -- the aim
is not only to personalize for an individual, but also to determine, with
sufficient statistical power, whether or not the system's intervention is
effective. It is essential to assess the effectiveness of the intervention
before broader deployment for better resource allocation. The two objectives
are often deployed under different model assumptions, making it hard to
determine how achieving the personalization and statistical power affect each
other. In this work, we develop general meta-algorithms to modify existing
algorithms such that sufficient power is guaranteed while still improving each
user's well-being. We also demonstrate that our meta-algorithms are robust to
various model mis-specifications possibly appearing in statistical studies,
thus providing a valuable tool to study designers.]]></summary>

transportation, autonomous navigation, manipulation as well as in scenarios
beyond robotics like virtual and augmented reality. With respect to single
image pose estimation, pose tracking takes into account the temporal
information across multiple frames to overcome possible detection
inconsistencies and to improve the pose estimation efficiency. In this work, we
introduce a novel Deep Neural Network (DNN) called VIPose, that combines
inertial and camera data to address the object pose tracking problem in
real-time. The key contribution is the design of a novel DNN architecture which
fuses visual and inertial features to predict the objects' relative 6D pose
between consecutive image frames. The overall 6D pose is then estimated by
consecutively combining relative poses. Our approach shows remarkable pose
estimation results for heavily occluded objects that are well known to be very
challenging to handle by existing state-of-the-art solutions. The effectiveness
of the proposed approach is validated on a new dataset called VIYCB with RGB

automated labeling technique. The approach presents accuracy performances

heterogeneous network architectures; and the data distribution is almost

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep neural networks (DNNs) for the semantic segmentation of images are
usually trained to operate on a predefined closed set of object classes. This
is in contrast to the "open world" setting where DNNs are envisioned to be
deployed to. From a functional safety point of view, the ability to detect
so-called "out-of-distribution" (OoD) samples, i.e., objects outside of a DNN's
semantic space, is crucial for many applications such as automated driving. A
natural baseline approach to OoD detection is to threshold on the pixel-wise
softmax entropy. We present a two-step procedure that significantly improves
that approach. Firstly, we utilize samples from the COCO dataset as OoD proxy
and introduce a second training objective to maximize the softmax entropy on
these samples. Starting from pretrained semantic segmentation networks we
re-train a number of DNNs on different in-distribution datasets and
consistently observe improved OoD detection performance when evaluating on
completely disjoint OoD datasets. Secondly, we perform a transparent
post-processing step to discard false positive OoD samples by so-called "meta
classification". To this end, we apply linear models to a set of hand-crafted
metrics derived from the DNN's softmax probabilities. In our experiments we
consistently observe a clear additional gain in OoD detection performance,
cutting down the number of detection errors by up to 52% when comparing the
best baseline with our results. We achieve this improvement sacrificing only
marginally in original segmentation performance. Therefore, our method
contributes to safer DNNs with more reliable overall system performance.]]></summary>

during surgical interventions. This procedure allows surgeons to wait for
histological findings during the intervention to base intra-operative decisions
on the outcome of the histology. However, compared to paraffin sections, the
quality of frozen sections is typically lower, leading to a higher ratio of
miss-classification. In this work, we investigated the effect of the section

cancer. This was enabled by a data set consisting of pairs of sections for
individual patients. Moreover, we investigated, whether a frozen-to-paraffin

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-class segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images seeks a
separation of data into anatomical components with known structure and
configuration. The most popular CNN-based methods are optimised using pixel
wise loss functions, ignorant of the spatially extended features that
characterise anatomy. Therefore, whilst sharing a high spatial overlap with the
ground truth, inferred CNN-based segmentations can lack coherence, including
spurious connected components, holes and voids. Such results are implausible,
violating anticipated anatomical topology. In response, (single-class)
persistent homology-based loss functions have been proposed to capture global
anatomical features. Our work extends these approaches to the task of
multi-class segmentation. Building an enriched topological description of all
class labels and class label pairs, our loss functions make predictable and
statistically significant improvements in segmentation topology using a
CNN-based post-processing framework. We also present (and make available) a
highly efficient implementation based on cubical complexes and parallel
execution, enabling practical application within high resolution 3D data for
the first time. We demonstrate our approach on 2D short axis and 3D whole heart
CMR segmentation, advancing a detailed and faithful analysis of performance on
two publicly available datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation aims to adapt
a segmentation model trained on the labeled source domain to the unlabeled
target domain. Existing methods try to learn domain invariant features while
suffering from large domain gaps that make it difficult to correctly align
discrepant features, especially in the initial training phase. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Dual Soft-Paste (DSP) method in this paper.
Specifically, DSP selects some classes from a source domain image using a
long-tail class first sampling strategy and softly pastes the corresponding
image patch on both the source and target training images with a fusion weight.
Technically, we adopt the mean teacher framework for domain adaptation, where
the pasted source and target images go through the student network while the
original target image goes through the teacher network. Output-level alignment
is carried out by aligning the probability maps of the target fused image from
both networks using a weighted cross-entropy loss. In addition, feature-level
alignment is carried out by aligning the feature maps of the source and target
images from student network using a weighted maximum mean discrepancy loss. DSP
facilitates the model learning domain-invariant features from the intermediate
domains, leading to faster convergence and better performance. Experiments on
two challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DSP over
state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

However, little exploration has been done in improving the size and inference
time of the model. At the same time, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models
are moving from server-side inference to local, on-device inference. Supporting
models in the transcription pipeline (like disfluency detection) must follow
suit. In this work we concentrate on the disfluency detection task, focusing on
small, fast, on-device models based on the BERT architecture. We demonstrate it
is possible to train disfluency detection models as small as 1.3 MiB, while
retaining high performance. We build on previous work that showed the benefit
of data augmentation approaches such as self-training. Then, we evaluate the
effect of domain mismatch between conversational and written text on model
performance. We find that domain adaptation and data augmentation strategies
have a more pronounced effect on these smaller models, as compared to

strategies to jointly address all three challenges. They require either a large

from the straggler tolerance. VCC leverages coded computing just for handling
stragglers and privacy, and then uses an orthogonal approach of verifiable
computing to tackle Byzantine nodes. Furthermore, VCC dynamically adapts its
coding scheme to tradeoff straggler tolerance with Byzantine protection and
vice-versa. We evaluate VCC on compute intensive distributed logistic

coordinate-based neural representations have shown impressive results in the
problem of multi-view 3D reconstruction. The effectiveness of these techniques
is, however, subject to the availability of a large number (several tens) of
input views of the scene, and computationally demanding optimizations. In this
paper, we tackle these limitations for the specific problem of few-shot full 3D
head reconstruction, by endowing coordinate-based representations with a
probabilistic shape prior that enables faster convergence and better
generalization when using few input images (down to three). First, we learn a
shape model of 3D heads from thousands of incomplete raw scans using implicit
representations. At test time, we jointly overfit two coordinate-based neural
networks to the scene, one modeling the geometry and another estimating the
surface radiance, using implicit differentiable rendering. We devise a
two-stage optimization strategy in which the learned prior is used to
initialize and constrain the geometry during an initial optimization phase.
Then, the prior is unfrozen and fine-tuned to the scene. By doing this, we
achieve high-fidelity head reconstructions, including hair and shoulders, and
with a high level of detail that consistently outperforms both state-of-the-art
3D Morphable Models methods in the few-shot scenario, and non-parametric

alpha of the reward distribution. While existing works in this setting mainly
focus on Upper Confidence Bound algorithms, we introduce a new Thompson
Sampling approach for CVaR bandits on bounded rewards that is flexible enough
to solve a variety of problems grounded on physical resources. Building on a
recent work by Riou & Honda (2020), we introduce B-CVTS for continuous bounded
rewards and M-CVTS for multinomial distributions. On the theoretical side, we
provide a non-trivial extension of their analysis that enables to theoretically
bound their CVaR regret minimization performance. Strikingly, our results show
that these strategies are the first to provably achieve asymptotic optimality
in CVaR bandits, matching the corresponding asymptotic lower bounds for this
setting. Further, we illustrate empirically the benefit of Thompson Sampling

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We consider the problem of adversarial (non-stochastic) online learning with
partial information feedback, where at each round, a decision maker selects an
action from a finite set of alternatives. We develop a black-box approach for
such problems where the learner observes as feedback only losses of a subset of
the actions that includes the selected action. When losses of actions are
non-negative, under the graph-based feedback model introduced by Mannor and
Shamir, we offer algorithms that attain the so called "small-loss" $o(\alpha
L^{\star})$ regret bounds with high probability, where $\alpha$ is the
independence number of the graph, and $L^{\star}$ is the loss of the best
action. Prior to our work, there was no data-dependent guarantee for general
feedback graphs even for pseudo-regret (without dependence on the number of
actions, i.e. utilizing the increased information feedback). Taking advantage
of the black-box nature of our technique, we extend our results to many other
applications such as semi-bandits (including routing in networks), contextual
bandits (even with an infinite comparator class), as well as learning with
slowly changing (shifting) comparators.

In the special case of classical bandit and semi-bandit problems, we provide
optimal small-loss, high-probability guarantees of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{dL^{\star}})$ for actual regret, where $d$ is the number of
actions, answering open questions of Neu. Previous bounds for bandits and
semi-bandits were known only for pseudo-regret and only in expectation. We also
offer an optimal $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\kappa L^{\star}})$ regret guarantee for
fixed feedback graphs with clique-partition number at most $\kappa$.]]></summary>

been proposed recently and achieved fruitful results in various fields. Among
them, Graph Attention Network (GAT) first employs a self-attention strategy to
learn attention weights for each edge in the spatial domain. However, learning
the attentions over edges can only focus on the local information of graphs and
greatly increases the computational costs. In this paper, we first introduce
the attention mechanism in the spectral domain of graphs and present Spectral
Graph Attention Network (SpGAT) that learns representations for different
frequency components regarding weighted filters and graph wavelets bases. In
this way, SpGAT can better capture global patterns of graphs in an efficient
manner with much fewer learned parameters than that of GAT. Further, to reduce
the computational cost of SpGAT brought by the eigen-decomposition, we propose
a fast approximation variant SpGAT-Cheby. We thoroughly evaluate the
performance of SpGAT and SpGAT-Cheby in semi-supervised node classification
tasks and verify the effectiveness of the learned attentions in the spectral

deliver impressive generalization results, although this comes at the expense
of limited interpretability. In particular, a key challenge is to determine
when to stop training the model, as this has a significant impact on
generalization. Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) comprise
high-dimensional feature spaces formed by the aggregation of multiple channels,
where analyzing intermediate data representations and the model's evolution can
be challenging owing to the curse of dimensionality. We present channel-wise
DeepNNK (CW-DeepNNK), a novel channel-wise generalization estimate based on
non-negative kernel regression (NNK) graphs with which we perform local
polytope interpolation on low-dimensional channels. This method leads to
instance-based interpretability of both the learned data representations and
the relationship between channels. Motivated by our observations, we use
CW-DeepNNK to propose a novel early stopping criterion that (i) does not
require a validation set, (ii) is based on a task performance metric, and (iii)
allows stopping to be reached at different points for each channel. Our
experiments demonstrate that our proposed method has advantages as compared to
the standard criterion based on validation set performance.]]></summary>

case, our method called Voting Folded Gaussian Attack (VFGA) scales efficiently
to ImageNet and achieves a significantly lower $L_0$ score than SparseFool (up
to $\frac{2}{5}$ lower) while being faster. Moreover, VFGA achieves better

complex behaviors for diverse agents. However, the success of current
reinforcement learning algorithms is predicated on an often under-emphasised
requirement -- each trial needs to start from a fixed initial state
distribution. Unfortunately, resetting the environment to its initial state
after each trial requires substantial amount of human supervision and extensive
instrumentation of the environment which defeats the purpose of autonomous
reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose Value-accelerated Persistent
Reinforcement Learning (VaPRL), which generates a curriculum of initial states
such that the agent can bootstrap on the success of easier tasks to efficiently
learn harder tasks. The agent also learns to reach the initial states proposed
by the curriculum, minimizing the reliance on human interventions into the
learning. We observe that VaPRL reduces the interventions required by three
orders of magnitude compared to episodic RL while outperforming prior
state-of-the art methods for reset-free RL both in terms of sample efficiency
and asymptotic performance on a variety of simulated robotics problems.]]></summary>

it requires a lot of computational resources to model entire traffic data. On

has been considered as a promising data technology to provide both flight crews

can support to detect the typical air routes between airports based on ADS-B

based on similarity measures, which helps to reduce the number of flight paths
between airports. As a matter of fact, our framework can be taken into account
to reduce practically the computational cost for air flow optimization and
evaluate the operational performance. Finally, in order to illustrate the
potential applications of our proposed framework, an experiment was performed
using ADS-B traffic flight data of three different pairs of airports. The
detected typical routes between each couple of airports show promising results
by virtue of combining two indices for measuring the clustering performance and

natural streams. An accurate prediction on LD coefficient(Dl) can produce a
performance leap in related simulation. The emerging machine learning(ML)
techniques provide a self-adaptive tool for this problem. However, most of the
existing studies utilize an unproved quaternion feature set, obtained through
simple theoretical deduction. Few studies have put attention on its reliability
and rationality. Besides, due to the lack of comparative comparison, the proper
choice of ML models in different scenarios still remains unknown. In this
study, the Feature Gradient selector was first adopted to distill the local
optimal feature sets directly from multivariable data. Then, a global optimal
feature set (the channel width, the flow velocity, the channel slope and the
cross sectional area) was proposed through numerical comparison of the
distilled local optimums in performance with representative ML models. The
channel slope is identified to be the key parameter for the prediction of LDC.
Further, we designed a weighted evaluation metric which enables comprehensive
model comparison. With the simple linear model as the baseline, a benchmark of
single and ensemble learning models was provided. Advantages and disadvantages
of the methods involved were also discussed. Results show that the support
vector machine has significantly better performance than other models. Decision
tree is not suitable for this problem due to poor generalization ability.
Notably, simple models show superiority over complicated model on this
low-dimensional problem, for their better balance between regression and
generalization.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Differentially private (DP) mechanisms face the challenge of providing
accurate results while protecting their inputs: the privacy-utility trade-off.
A simple but powerful technique for DP adds noise to sensitivity-bounded query
outputs to blur the exact query output: additive mechanisms. While a vast body
of work considers infinitely wide noise distributions, some applications (e.g.,
real-time operating systems) require hard bounds on the deviations from the
real query, and only limited work on such mechanisms exist. An additive
mechanism with truncated noise (i.e., with bounded range) can offer such hard
bounds. We introduce a gradient-descent-based tool to learn truncated noise for
additive mechanisms with strong utility bounds while simultaneously optimizing
for differential privacy under sequential composition, i.e., scenarios where
multiple noisy queries on the same data are revealed. Our method can learn
discrete noise patterns and not only hyper-parameters of a predefined
probability distribution. For sensitivity bounded mechanisms, we show that it
is sufficient to consider symmetric and that\new{, for from the mean
monotonically falling noise,} ensuring privacy for a pair of representative
query outputs guarantees privacy for all pairs of inputs (that differ in one
element). We find that the utility-privacy trade-off curves of our generated
noise are remarkably close to truncated Gaussians and even replicate their
shape for $l_2$ utility-loss. For a low number of compositions, we also
improved DP-SGD (sub-sampling). Moreover, we extend Moments Accountant to
truncated distributions, allowing to incorporate mechanism output events with
varying input-dependent zero occurrence probability.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although high-performance deep neural networks are in high demand in edge
environments, computation resources are strictly limited in edge devices, and
light-weight neural network techniques, such as Depthwise Separable Convolution
(DSC), have been developed. ResNet is one of conventional deep neural network
models that stack a lot of layers and parameters for a higher accuracy. To
reduce the parameter size of ResNet, by utilizing a similarity to ODE (Ordinary
Differential Equation), Neural ODE repeatedly uses most of weight parameters
instead of having a lot of different parameters. Thus, Neural ODE becomes
significantly small compared to that of ResNet so that it can be implemented in
resource-limited edge devices. In this paper, a combination of Neural ODE and
DSC, called dsODENet, is designed and implemented for FPGAs (Field-Programmable
Gate Arrays). dsODENet is then applied to edge domain adaptation as a practical
use case and evaluated with image classification datasets. It is implemented on
Xilinx ZCU104 board and evaluated in terms of domain adaptation accuracy,
training speed, FPGA resource utilization, and speedup rate compared to a
software execution. The results demonstrate that dsODENet is comparable to or
slightly better than our baseline Neural ODE implementation in terms of domain
adaptation accuracy, while the total parameter size without pre- and
post-processing layers is reduced by 54.2% to 79.8%. The FPGA implementation
accelerates the prediction tasks by 27.9 times faster than a software
implementation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurological disorder
that results in rigidity, tremors and postural instability. There is no
definite medical test to diagnose PD and diagnosis is mostly a clinical
exercise. Although guidelines exist, about 10-30% of the patients are wrongly
diagnosed with PD. Hence, there is a need for an accurate, unbiased and fast
method for diagnosis. In this study, we propose LPGNet, a fast and accurate
method to diagnose PD from gait. LPGNet uses Linear Prediction Residuals (LPR)
to extract discriminating patterns from gait recordings and then uses a 1D
convolution neural network with depth-wise separable convolutions to perform
diagnosis. LPGNet achieves an AUC of 0.91 with a 21 times speedup and about 99%
lesser parameters in the model compared to the state of the art. We also
undertake an analysis of various cross-validation strategies used in literature
in PD diagnosis from gait and find that most methods are affected by some form
of data leakage between various folds which leads to unnecessarily large models
and inflated performance due to overfitting. The analysis clears the path for
future works in correctly evaluating their methods.]]></summary>

(DNNs) for system identification. Although DNNs show impressive approximation
ability in various fields, several challenges still exist for system
identification problems. First, DNNs are known to be too complex that they can
easily overfit the training data. Second, the selection of the input regressors
for system identification is nontrivial. Third, uncertainty quantification of
the model parameters and predictions are necessary. The proposed Bayesian
approach offers a principled way to alleviate the above challenges by marginal
likelihood/model evidence approximation and structured group sparsity-inducing
priors construction. The identification algorithm is derived as an iterative
regularized optimization procedure that can be solved as efficiently as
training typical DNNs. Furthermore, a practical calculation approach based on
the Monte-Carlo integration method is derived to quantify the uncertainty of
the parameters and predictions. The effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian

arousal. In this contribution, we utilise a dataset which includes continuous

scenario (Trier Social Stress Test). We utilise a Long Short-Term Memory,
Recurrent Neural Network to explore the benefit of fusing these physiological
signals with arousal as the target, learning from various audio, video, and
textual based features. We utilise the state-of-the-art MuSe-Toolbox to
consider both annotation delay and inter-rater agreement weighting when fusing
the target signals. An improvement in Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC)
is seen across features sets when fusing EDA with arousal, compared to the
arousal only gold standard results. Additionally, BERT-based textual features'
results improved for arousal plus all physiological signals, obtaining up to
.3344 CCC compared to .2118 CCC for arousal only. Multimodal fusion also
improves overall CCC with audio plus video features obtaining up to .6157 CCC

various neuropsychiatric disorders. Recent application of deep neural networks
(DNNs) to connectome-based classification mostly relies on traditional
convolutional neural networks using input connectivity matrices on a regular
Euclidean grid. We propose a graph deep learning framework to incorporate the
non-Euclidean information about graph structure for classifying functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)- derived brain networks in major depressive
disorder (MDD). We design a novel graph autoencoder (GAE) architecture based on
the graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to embed the topological structure and
node content of large-sized fMRI networks into low-dimensional latent
representations. In network construction, we employ the Ledoit-Wolf (LDW)
shrinkage method to estimate the high-dimensional FC metrics efficiently from
fMRI data. We consider both supervised and unsupervised approaches for the
graph embedded learning. The learned embeddings are then used as feature inputs
for a deep fully-connected neural network (FCNN) to discriminate MDD from
healthy controls. Evaluated on a resting-state fMRI MDD dataset with 43
subjects, results show that the proposed GAE-FCNN model significantly
outperforms several state-of-the-art DNN methods for brain connectome
classification, achieving accuracy of 72.50% using the LDW-FC metrics as node
features. The graph embeddings of fMRI FC networks learned by the GAE also
reveal apparent group differences between MDD and HC. Our new framework
demonstrates feasibility of learning graph embeddings on brain networks to
provide discriminative information for diagnosis of brain disorders.]]></summary>

osteoarthritis (OA) can address the limitation of the current OA assessment.
Segmentation of bone, cartilage, and joint fluid is necessary for the OA
objective assessment. Most of the proposed segmentation methods are not
performing instance segmentation and suffer from class imbalance problems. This
study deployed Mask R-CNN instance segmentation and improved it (improved-Mask
R-CNN (iMaskRCNN)) to obtain a more accurate generalized segmentation for
OA-associated tissues. Training and validation of the method were performed
using 500 MRI knees from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset and 97 MRI
scans of patients with symptomatic hip OA. Three modifications to Mask R-CNN
yielded the iMaskRCNN: adding a 2nd ROIAligned block, adding an extra decoder
layer to the mask-header, and connecting them by a skip connection. The results
were assessed using Hausdorff distance, dice score, and coefficients of
variation (CoV). The iMaskRCNN led to improved bone and cartilage segmentation
compared to Mask RCNN as indicated with the increase in dice score from 95% to
98% for the femur, 95% to 97% for tibia, 71% to 80% for femoral cartilage, and
81% to 82% for tibial cartilage. For the effusion detection, dice improved with
iMaskRCNN 72% versus MaskRCNN 71%. The CoV values for effusion detection
between Reader1 and Mask R-CNN (0.33), Reader1 and iMaskRCNN (0.34), Reader2
and Mask R-CNN (0.22), Reader2 and iMaskRCNN (0.29) are close to CoV between
two readers (0.21), indicating a high agreement between the human readers and
both Mask R-CNN and iMaskRCNN. Mask R-CNN and iMaskRCNN can reliably and
simultaneously extract different scale articular tissues involved in OA,
forming the foundation for automated assessment of OA. The iMaskRCNN results
show that the modification improved the network performance around the edges.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many available formal verification methods have been shown to be instances of
a unified Branch-and-Bound (BaB) formulation. We propose a novel machine
learning framework that can be used for designing an effective branching
strategy as well as for computing better lower bounds. Specifically, we learn
two graph neural networks (GNN) that both directly treat the network we want to
verify as a graph input and perform forward-backward passes through the GNN
layers. We use one GNN to simulate the strong branching heuristic behaviour and
another to compute a feasible dual solution of the convex relaxation, thereby
providing a valid lower bound.

We provide a new verification dataset that is more challenging than those
used in the literature, thereby providing an effective alternative for testing
algorithmic improvements for verification. Whilst using just one of the GNNs
leads to a reduction in verification time, we get optimal performance when
combining the two GNN approaches. Our combined framework achieves a 50\%
reduction in both the number of branches and the time required for verification
on various convolutional networks when compared to several state-of-the-art
verification methods. In addition, we show that our GNN models generalize well
to harder properties on larger unseen networks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent deep networks have convincingly demonstrated high capability in crowd
counting, which is a critical task attracting widespread attention due to its
various industrial applications. Despite such progress, trained data-dependent
models usually can not generalize well to unseen scenarios because of the
inherent domain shift. To facilitate this issue, this paper proposes a novel
adversarial scoring network (ASNet) to gradually bridge the gap across domains
from coarse to fine granularity. In specific, at the coarse-grained stage, we
design a dual-discriminator strategy to adapt source domain to be close to the
targets from the perspectives of both global and local feature space via
adversarial learning. The distributions between two domains can thus be aligned
roughly. At the fine-grained stage, we explore the transferability of source
characteristics by scoring how similar the source samples are to target ones
from multiple levels based on generative probability derived from coarse stage.
Guided by these hierarchical scores, the transferable source features are
properly selected to enhance the knowledge transfer during the adaptation
process. With the coarse-to-fine design, the generalization bottleneck induced
from the domain discrepancy can be effectively alleviated. Three sets of
migration experiments show that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art
counting performance compared with major unsupervised methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nowadays, multi-sensor technologies are applied in many fields, e.g., Health
Care (HC), Human Activity Recognition (HAR), and Industrial Control System
(ICS). These sensors can generate a substantial amount of multivariate
time-series data. Unsupervised anomaly detection on multi-sensor time-series
data has been proven critical in machine learning researches. The key challenge
is to discover generalized normal patterns by capturing spatial-temporal
correlation in multi-sensor data. Beyond this challenge, the noisy data is
often intertwined with the training data, which is likely to mislead the model
by making it hard to distinguish between the normal, abnormal, and noisy data.
Few of previous researches can jointly address these two challenges. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based anomaly detection algorithm
called Deep Convolutional Autoencoding Memory network (CAE-M). We first build a
Deep Convolutional Autoencoder to characterize spatial dependence of
multi-sensor data with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to better distinguish
between the noisy, normal, and abnormal data. Then, we construct a Memory
Network consisting of linear (Autoregressive Model) and non-linear predictions
(Bidirectional LSTM with Attention) to capture temporal dependence from
time-series data. Finally, CAE-M jointly optimizes these two subnetworks. We
empirically compare the proposed approach with several state-of-the-art anomaly
detection methods on HAR and HC datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed model outperforms these existing methods.]]></summary>

multiplications with activation matrices on activation domains, we obtain an

Sufficient and necessary conditions for convergence of these infinite products
of matrices are studied. As a result, we establish necessary conditions for
ReLU networks to converge that the sequence of weight matrices converges to the
identity matrix and the sequence of the bias vectors converges to zero as the
depth of ReLU networks increases to infinity. Moreover, we obtain sufficient

to traditional deep learning frameworks, due to their promise to provide
increased compute efficiency on event-driven neuromorphic hardware. However, to
perform well on complex vision applications, most SNN training frameworks yield
large inference latency which translates to increased spike activity and
reduced energy efficiency. Hence,minimizing average spike activity while
preserving accuracy indeep SNNs remains a significant challenge and
opportunity.This paper presents a non-iterative SNN training technique
thatachieves ultra-high compression with reduced spiking activitywhile
maintaining high inference accuracy. In particular, our framework first uses
the attention-maps of an un compressed meta-model to yield compressed ANNs.
This step can be tuned to support both irregular and structured channel pruning
to leverage computational benefits over a broad range of platforms. The
framework then performs sparse-learning-based supervised SNN training using
direct inputs. During the training, it jointly optimizes the SNN weight,
threshold, and leak parameters to drastically minimize the number of time steps
required while retaining compression. To evaluate the merits of our approach,
we performed experiments with variants of VGG and ResNet, on both CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100, and VGG16 on Tiny-ImageNet.The SNN models generated through the
proposed technique yield SOTA compression ratios of up to 33.4x with no
significant drops in accuracy compared to baseline unpruned counterparts.
Compared to existing SNN pruning methods, we achieve up to 8.3x higher
compression with improved accuracy.]]></summary>

and attracted increasing attention. However, how to develop effective domain
adaptation techniques to improve its cross-domain performance remains
unexplored and unclear. In this paper, we delve into this topic and empirically
find that direct feature distribution alignment on the CNN backbone only brings
limited improvements, as it does not guarantee domain-invariant sequence
features in the transformer for prediction. To address this issue, we propose a
novel Sequence Feature Alignment (SFA) method that is specially designed for
the adaptation of detection transformers. Technically, SFA consists of a domain
query-based feature alignment (DQFA) module and a token-wise feature alignment
(TDA) module. In DQFA, a novel domain query is used to aggregate and align
global context from the token sequence of both domains. DQFA reduces the domain
discrepancy in global feature representations and object relations when
deploying in the transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. Meanwhile, TDA
aligns token features in the sequence from both domains, which reduces the
domain gaps in local and instance-level feature representations in the
transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. Besides, a novel bipartite
matching consistency loss is proposed to enhance the feature discriminability
for robust object detection. Experiments on three challenging benchmarks show
that SFA outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptive object detection methods.

high-fidelity simulators that adequately capture the variability of real-world
scenarios. However, it is generally not feasible to exhaustively search the
space of simulation scenarios for failures. Adaptive stress testing (AST) is a
method that uses reinforcement learning to find the most likely failure of a
system. AST with a deep reinforcement learning solver has been shown to be
effective in finding failures across a range of different systems. This
approach generally involves running many simulations, which can be very
expensive when using a high-fidelity simulator. To improve efficiency, we
present a method that first finds failures in a low-fidelity simulator. It then
uses the backward algorithm, which trains a deep neural network policy using a
single expert demonstration, to adapt the low-fidelity failures to
high-fidelity. We have created a series of autonomous vehicle validation case
studies that represent some of the ways low-fidelity and high-fidelity
simulators can differ, such as time discretization. We demonstrate in a variety
of case studies that this new AST approach is able to find failures with
significantly fewer high-fidelity simulation steps than are needed when just
running AST directly in high-fidelity. As a proof of concept, we also
demonstrate AST on NVIDIA's DriveSim simulator, an industry state-of-the-art

pattern as point-wise methods (e.g., PointNet) and no longer suffer from the
quantization issue like conventional convolutions. For further speed
optimization, we propose the grid-based downsampling and voxelization method,
and provide different CUDA implementations to accommodate to the discrepant
requirements during training and inference phases. We highlight our efficiency
on KITTI 3D object detection dataset with 75 FPS and on Waymo Open dataset with
25 FPS inference speed with satisfactory accuracy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Confidence calibration is of great importance to the reliability of decisions
made by machine learning systems. However, discriminative classifiers based on
deep neural networks are often criticized for producing overconfident
predictions that fail to reflect the true correctness likelihood of
classification accuracy. We argue that such an inability to model uncertainty
is mainly caused by the closed-world nature in softmax: a model trained by the
cross-entropy loss will be forced to classify input into one of $K$ pre-defined
categories with high probability. To address this problem, we for the first
time propose a novel $K$+1-way softmax formulation, which incorporates the
modeling of open-world uncertainty as the extra dimension. To unify the
learning of the original $K$-way classification task and the extra dimension
that models uncertainty, we propose a novel energy-based objective function,
and moreover, theoretically prove that optimizing such an objective essentially
forces the extra dimension to capture the marginal data distribution. Extensive
experiments show that our approach, Energy-based Open-World Softmax
(EOW-Softmax), is superior to existing state-of-the-art methods in improving

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, the problem of inaccurate learning targets in crowd counting draws
increasing attention. Inspired by a few pioneering work, we solve this problem
by trying to predict the indices of pre-defined interval bins of counts instead
of the count values themselves. However, an inappropriate interval setting
might make the count error contributions from different intervals extremely
imbalanced, leading to inferior counting performance. Therefore, we propose a
novel count interval partition criterion called Uniform Error Partition (UEP),
which always keeps the expected counting error contributions equal for all
intervals to minimize the prediction risk. Then to mitigate the inevitably
introduced discretization errors in the count quantization process, we propose
another criterion called Mean Count Proxies (MCP). The MCP criterion selects
the best count proxy for each interval to represent its count value during
inference, making the overall expected discretization error of an image nearly
negligible. As far as we are aware, this work is the first to delve into such a
classification task and ends up with a promising solution for count interval
partition. Following the above two theoretically demonstrated criterions, we
propose a simple yet effective model termed Uniform Error Partition Network
(UEPNet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging
datasets. The codes will be available at:

solutions. One solution is to add a regulation term, which represents the

of insertion loss. In the second method, a third-order polynomial expression is
defined first, which ensures positiveness, to approximate the insertion loss,
then DeepONet neural network structure, which was proposed recently for
function and system modeling, was employed to model the coefficients of
polynomials. The resulting neural network is applied to predict the
coefficients of the polynomial expression. The experimental results on an
open-sourced SI/PI database of a PCB design show that both methods can ensure

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The successes of deep learning critically rely on the ability of neural
networks to output meaningful predictions on unseen data -- generalization. Yet
despite its criticality, there remain fundamental open questions on how neural
networks generalize. How much do neural networks rely on memorization -- seeing
highly similar training examples -- and how much are they capable of
human-intelligence styled reasoning -- identifying abstract rules underlying
the data? In this paper we introduce a novel benchmark, Pointer Value Retrieval
(PVR) tasks, that explore the limits of neural network generalization. While
PVR tasks can consist of visual as well as symbolic inputs, each with varying
levels of difficulty, they all have a simple underlying rule. One part of the
PVR task input acts as a pointer, giving the location of a different part of
the input, which forms the value (and output). We demonstrate that this task
structure provides a rich testbed for understanding generalization, with our
empirical study showing large variations in neural network performance based on
dataset size, task complexity and model architecture. The interaction of
position, values and the pointer rule also allow the development of nuanced
tests of generalization, by introducing distribution shift and increasing
functional complexity. These reveal both subtle failures and surprising
successes, suggesting many promising directions of exploration on this
benchmark.]]></summary>

including many safety-critical applications. However, recently several works
raise the security issues of 3D deep nets. Although most of these works
consider adversarial attacks, we identify that backdoor attack is indeed a more
serious threat to 3D deep learning systems but remains unexplored. We present
the backdoor attacks in 3D with a unified framework that exploits the unique
properties of 3D data and networks. In particular, we design two attack
approaches: the poison-label attack and the clean-label attack. The first one
is straightforward and effective in practice, while the second one is more
sophisticated assuming there are certain data inspections. The attack
algorithms are mainly motivated and developed by 1) the recent discovery of 3D
adversarial samples which demonstrate the vulnerability of 3D deep nets under
spatial transformations; 2) the proposed feature disentanglement technique that
manipulates the feature of the data through optimization methods and its
potential to embed a new task. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of the
poison-label attack with over 95% success rate across several 3D datasets and
models, and the ability of clean-label attack against data filtering with
around 50% success rate. Our proposed backdoor attack in 3D point cloud is

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Traditional learning systems are trained in closed-world for a fixed number
of classes, and need pre-collected datasets in advance. However, new classes
often emerge in real-world applications and should be learned incrementally.
For example, in electronic commerce, new types of products appear daily, and in
a social media community, new topics emerge frequently. Under such
circumstances, incremental models should learn several new classes at a time
without forgetting. We find a strong correlation between old and new classes in
incremental learning, which can be applied to relate and facilitate different
learning stages mutually. As a result, we propose CO-transport for class
Incremental Learning (COIL), which learns to relate across incremental tasks
with the class-wise semantic relationship. In detail, co-transport has two
aspects: prospective transport tries to augment the old classifier with optimal
transported knowledge as fast model adaptation. Retrospective transport aims to
transport new class classifiers backward as old ones to overcome forgetting.
With these transports, COIL efficiently adapts to new tasks, and stably resists
forgetting. Experiments on benchmark and real-world multimedia datasets
validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.]]></summary>

to change the way we commute. Much effort has been put into trying to estimate
the state of a vehicle. Meanwhile, learning to forecast the state of a vehicle
ahead introduces new capabilities, such as predicting dangerous situations.
Moreover, forecasting brings new supervision opportunities by learning to
predict richer a context, expressed by multiple horizons. Intuitively, a video
stream originated from a front-facing camera is necessary because it encodes
information about the upcoming road. Besides, historical traces of the
vehicle's states give more context. In this paper, we tackle multi-horizon
forecasting of vehicle states by fusing the two modalities. We design and
experiment with 3 end-to-end architectures that exploit 3D convolutions for
visual features extraction and 1D convolutions for features extraction from
speed and steering angle traces. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method, we perform extensive experiments on two publicly available real-world
datasets, Comma2k19 and the Udacity challenge. We show that we are able to
forecast a vehicle's state to various horizons, while outperforming the current
state-of-the-art results on the related task of driving state estimation. We
examine the contribution of vision features, and find that a model fed with
vision features achieves an error that is 56.6% and 66.9% of the error of a
model that doesn't use those features, on the Udacity and Comma2k19 datasets
respectively.]]></summary>

have promised to increase data throughput by allowing concurrent communication
between one Access Point and multiple users. However, we are still a long way
from enjoying such MU-MIMO MAC protocol improvements for bandwidth hungry
applications such as video streaming in practical WiFi network settings due to
heterogeneous channel conditions and devices, unreliable transmissions, and
lack of useful feedback exchange among the lower and upper layers'
requirements. This paper introduces MuViS, a novel dual-phase optimization
framework that proposes a Quality of Experience (QoE) aware MU-MIMO
optimization for multi-user video streaming over IEEE 802.11ac. MuViS first
employs reinforcement learning to optimize the MU-MIMO user group and mode
selection for users based on their PHY/MAC layer characteristics. The video
bitrate is then optimized based on the user's mode (Multi-User (MU) or
Single-User (SU)). We present our design and its evaluation on smartphones and
laptops using 802.11ac WiFi. Our experimental results in various indoor

COVID-19 from coughs, breaths and speech as this type of screening is
non-contact, does not require specialist medical expertise or laboratory
facilities and can easily be deployed on inexpensive consumer hardware.

Smartphone recordings of cough, breath and speech from subjects around the
globe are used for classification by seven standard machine learning
classifiers using leave-$p$-out cross-validation to provide a promising
baseline performance.

Then, a diverse dataset of 10.29 hours of cough, sneeze, speech and noise
audio recordings are used to pre-train a CNN, LSTM and Resnet50 classifier and
fine tuned the model to enhance the performance even further.

We have also extracted the bottleneck features from these pre-trained models
by removing the final-two layers and used them as an input to the LR, SVM, MLP
and KNN classifiers to detect COVID-19 signature.

The highest AUC of 0.98 was achieved using a transfer learning based Resnet50
architecture on coughs from Coswara dataset.

The highest AUC of 0.94 and 0.92 was achieved from an SVM run on the
bottleneck features extracted from the breaths from Coswara dataset and speech
recordings from ComParE dataset.

We conclude that among all vocal audio, coughs carry the strongest COVID-19
signature followed by breath and speech and using transfer learning improves
the classifier performance with higher AUC and lower variance across the
cross-validation folds.

Although these signatures are not perceivable by human ear, machine learning
based COVID-19 detection is possible from vocal audio recorded via smartphone.]]></summary>

(EMD). We model the datasets as distributions supported on common data graph
that is derived from the affinity matrix computed on the combined data. In such
cases where the graph is a discretization of an underlying Riemannian closed
manifold, we prove that Diffusion EMD is topologically equivalent to the
standard EMD with a geodesic ground distance. Diffusion EMD can be computed in
$\tilde{O}(n)$ time and is more accurate than similarly fast algorithms such as
tree-based EMDs. We also show Diffusion EMD is fully differentiable, making it
amenable to future uses in gradient-descent frameworks such as deep neural
networks. Finally, we demonstrate an application of Diffusion EMD to single
cell data collected from 210 COVID-19 patient samples at Yale New Haven
Hospital. Here, Diffusion EMD can derive distances between patients on the
manifold of cells at least two orders of magnitude faster than equally accurate
methods. This distance matrix between patients can be embedded into a higher
level patient manifold which uncovers structure and heterogeneity in patients.
More generally, Diffusion EMD is applicable to all datasets that are massively

applicability is limited by the reliance on annotated examples. Self-supervised
learning has emerged as a promising direction to alleviate the supervision
bottleneck, but existing work focuses on leveraging co-occurrences in unlabeled
data for task-agnostic representation learning, as exemplified by masked
language model pretraining. In this chapter, we explore task-specific
self-supervision, which leverages domain knowledge to automatically annotate
noisy training examples for end applications, either by introducing labeling
functions for annotating individual instances, or by imposing constraints over
interdependent label decisions. We first present deep probabilistic logic(DPL),
which offers a unifying framework for task-specific self-supervision by
composing probabilistic logic with deep learning. DPL represents unknown labels
as latent variables and incorporates diverse self-supervision using
probabilistic logic to train a deep neural network end-to-end using variational
EM. Next, we present self-supervised self-supervision(S4), which adds to DPL
the capability to learn new self-supervision automatically. Starting from an
initial seed self-supervision, S4 iteratively uses the deep neural network to
propose new self supervision. These are either added directly (a form of
structured self-training) or verified by a human expert (as in feature-based
active learning). Experiments on real-world applications such as biomedical
machine reading and various text classification tasks show that task-specific
self-supervision can effectively leverage domain expertise and often match the
accuracy of supervised methods with a tiny fraction of human effort.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Latest Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are gathering outstanding
results through a large-scale training, thus employing models composed of
millions of parameters requiring extensive computational capabilities. Building
such huge models undermines their replicability and increases the training
instability. Moreover, multi-channel data, such as images or audio, are usually
processed by realvalued convolutional networks that flatten and concatenate the
input, often losing intra-channel spatial relations. To address these issues
related to complexity and information loss, we propose a family of
quaternion-valued generative adversarial networks (QGANs). QGANs exploit the
properties of quaternion algebra, e.g., the Hamilton product, that allows to
process channels as a single entity and capture internal latent relations,
while reducing by a factor of 4 the overall number of parameters. We show how
to design QGANs and to extend the proposed approach even to advanced models.We
compare the proposed QGANs with real-valued counterparts on several image
generation benchmarks. Results show that QGANs are able to obtain better FID
scores than real-valued GANs and to generate visually pleasing images.
Furthermore, QGANs save up to 75% of the training parameters. We believe these
results may pave the way to novel, more accessible, GANs capable of improving
performance and saving computational resources.]]></summary>

by some measure of their difficulty and gradually exposes them to the learner
to improve the network performance. Motivated by our insights from implicit

score the difficulty of data points for real image classification tasks. We
empirically show its improvements in performance with convolutional and

propose and study the performance of a dynamic curriculum learning algorithm.
Our dynamic curriculum algorithm tries to reduce the distance between the

single-image super-resolution (SR) by recovering photo-realistic images.
However, high memory consumption of GAN-based SR (usually generators) causes
performance degradation and more energy consumption, hindering the deployment
of GAN-based SR into resource-constricted mobile devices. In this paper, we
propose a novel compression framework \textbf{M}ulti-scale \textbf{F}eature
\textbf{A}ggregation Net based \textbf{GAN} (MFAGAN) for reducing the memory
access cost of the generator. First, to overcome the memory explosion of dense
connections, we utilize a memory-efficient multi-scale feature aggregation net
as the generator. Second, for faster and more stable training, our method
introduces the PatchGAN discriminator. Third, to balance the student
discriminator and the compressed generator, we distill both the generator and
the discriminator. Finally, we perform a hardware-aware neural architecture
search (NAS) to find a specialized SubGenerator for the target mobile phone.
Benefiting from these improvements, the proposed MFAGAN achieves up to
\textbf{8.3}$\times$ memory saving and \textbf{42.9}$\times$ computation
reduction, with only minor visual quality degradation, compared with ESRGAN.
Empirical studies also show $\sim$\textbf{70} milliseconds latency on Qualcomm

distributed fog nodes at the edge of the Internet, enabling compute-intensive
and latency-sensitive computing services for vehicles through task offloading.
However, a heterogeneous mobility environment introduces uncertainties in terms
of resource supply and demand, which are inevitable bottlenecks for the optimal
offloading decision. Also, these uncertainties bring extra challenges to task
offloading under the oblivious adversary attack and data privacy risks. In this
article, we develop a new adversarial online learning algorithm with bandit
feedback based on the adversarial multi-armed bandit theory, to enable scalable
and low-complexity offloading decision making. Specifically, we focus on
optimizing fog node selection with the aim of minimizing the offloading service
costs in terms of delay and energy. The key is to implicitly tune the
exploration bonus in the selection process and the assessment rules of the
designed algorithm, taking into account volatile resource supply and demand. We
theoretically prove that the input-size dependent selection rule allows to
choose a suitable fog node without exploring the sub-optimal actions, and also
an appropriate score patching rule allows to quickly adapt to evolving
circumstances, which reduce variance and bias simultaneously, thereby achieving
a better exploitation-exploration balance. Simulation results verify the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.]]></summary>

individual to manipulate part of its content, primarily its identity, while
maintaining the rest unchanged. Research in neural VC has accomplished
considerable breakthroughs with the capacity to falsify a voice identity using
a small amount of data with a highly realistic rendering. This paper goes
beyond voice identity and presents a neural architecture that allows the
manipulation of voice attributes (e.g., gender and age). Leveraging the latest
advances on adversarial learning of structured speech representation, a novel
structured neural network is proposed in which multiple auto-encoders are used
to encode speech as a set of idealistically independent linguistic and
extra-linguistic representations, which are learned adversariarly and can be
manipulated during VC. Moreover, the proposed architecture is time-synchronized
so that the original voice timing is preserved during conversion which allows
lip-sync applications. Applied to voice gender conversion on the real-world
VCTK dataset, our proposed architecture can learn successfully
gender-independent representation and convert the voice gender with a very high
efficiency and naturalness.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this work we create agents that can perform well beyond a single,
individual task, that exhibit much wider generalisation of behaviour to a
massive, rich space of challenges. We define a universe of tasks within an
environment domain and demonstrate the ability to train agents that are
generally capable across this vast space and beyond. The environment is
natively multi-agent, spanning the continuum of competitive, cooperative, and
independent games, which are situated within procedurally generated physical 3D
worlds. The resulting space is exceptionally diverse in terms of the challenges
posed to agents, and as such, even measuring the learning progress of an agent
is an open research problem. We propose an iterative notion of improvement
between successive generations of agents, rather than seeking to maximise a
singular objective, allowing us to quantify progress despite tasks being
incomparable in terms of achievable rewards. We show that through constructing
an open-ended learning process, which dynamically changes the training task
distributions and training objectives such that the agent never stops learning,
we achieve consistent learning of new behaviours. The resulting agent is able
to score reward in every one of our humanly solvable evaluation levels, with
behaviour generalising to many held-out points in the universe of tasks.
Examples of this zero-shot generalisation include good performance on Hide and
Seek, Capture the Flag, and Tag. Through analysis and hand-authored probe tasks
we characterise the behaviour of our agent, and find interesting emergent
heuristic behaviours such as trial-and-error experimentation, simple tool use,
option switching, and cooperation. Finally, we demonstrate that the general
capabilities of this agent could unlock larger scale transfer of behaviour

CFLOW-AD is faster and smaller by a factor of 10x than prior state-of-the-art

selected for training. These algorithms are sensitive to such thresholds, and
it is difficult to fix or learn these thresholds. Often, these algorithms also
require information such as label noise rates which are typically unavailable
in practice. In this paper, we propose a data-dependent, adaptive sample
selection strategy that relies only on batch statistics of a given mini-batch
to provide robustness against label noise. The algorithm does not have any
additional hyperparameters for sample selection, does not need any information
on noise rates, and does not need access to separate data with clean labels. We
empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on benchmark
datasets.]]></summary>

capture the rich joint data distributions of a relational table, most of the

information in the deep autoregressive model, we develop differentiable
progressive sampling using the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Second, UAE is able to
utilize both types of information to learn the joint data distribution in a
single model. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UAE achieves
single-digit multiplicative error at tail, better accuracies over

Both accuracy and inference time are meaningful for a lot of them. While the
number of FLOPs is usually used as a proxy for neural network latency, it may
be not the best choice. In order to obtain a better approximation of latency,
research community uses look-up tables of all possible layers for latency
calculation for the final prediction of the inference on mobile CPU. It
requires only a small number of experiments. Unfortunately, on mobile GPU this
method is not applicable in a straight-forward way and shows low precision. In
this work, we consider latency approximation on mobile GPU as a data and
hardware-specific problem. Our main goal is to construct a convenient latency
estimation tool for investigation(LETI) of neural network inference and
building robust and accurate latency prediction models for each specific task.
To achieve this goal, we build open-source tools which provide a convenient way
to conduct massive experiments on different target devices focusing on mobile
GPU. After evaluation of the dataset, we learn the regression model on
experimental data and use it for future latency prediction and analysis. We
experimentally demonstrate the applicability of such an approach on a subset of
popular NAS-Benchmark 101 dataset and also evaluate the most popular neural
network architectures for two mobile GPUs. As a result, we construct latency
prediction model with good precision on the target evaluation subset. We
consider LETI as a useful tool for neural architecture search or massive
latency evaluation. The project is available at https://github.com/leti-ai]]></summary>

are typically only the by-product of a segmentation task. Intersection over

probability calibration approaches have been studied, which match probability
outputs with experimentally observed errors. These approaches mainly focus on
classification tasks, but not on semantic segmentation. Thus, we propose a
learning-based calibration method that focuses on multi-label semantic
segmentation. Specifically, we adopt a convolutional neural network to predict
local temperature values for probability calibration. One advantage of our
approach is that it does not change prediction accuracy, hence allowing for
calibration as a post-processing step. Experiments on the COCO, CamVid, and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motivation: Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET) is a 3D bioimaging tool that
visualizes the structural and spatial organization of macromolecules at a
near-native state in single cells, which has broad applications in life
science. However, the systematic structural recognition and recovery of
macromolecules captured by cryo-ET are difficult due to high structural
complexity and imaging limits. Deep learning based subtomogram classification
have played critical roles for such tasks. As supervised approaches, however,
their performance relies on sufficient and laborious annotation on a large
training dataset.

Results: To alleviate this major labeling burden, we proposed a Hybrid Active
Learning (HAL) framework for querying subtomograms for labelling from a large
unlabeled subtomogram pool. Firstly, HAL adopts uncertainty sampling to select
the subtomograms that have the most uncertain predictions. Moreover, to
mitigate the sampling bias caused by such strategy, a discriminator is
introduced to judge if a certain subtomogram is labeled or unlabeled and
subsequently the model queries the subtomogram that have higher probabilities
to be unlabeled. Additionally, HAL introduces a subset sampling strategy to
improve the diversity of the query set, so that the information overlap is
decreased between the queried batches and the algorithmic efficiency is
improved. Our experiments on subtomogram classification tasks using both
simulated and real data demonstrate that we can achieve comparable testing
performance (on average only 3% accuracy drop) by using less than 30% of the
labeled subtomograms, which shows a very promising result for subtomogram
classification task with limited labeling resources.]]></summary>

scalable machine learning among multiple participants, such as end users,
organizations and companies. However, most existing FL or distributed learning
frameworks have not well addressed two important issues together: collaborative
fairness and adversarial robustness (e.g. free-riders and malicious
participants). In conventional FL, all participants receive the global model
(equal rewards), which might be unfair to the high-contributing participants.
Furthermore, due to the lack of a safeguard mechanism, free-riders or malicious
adversaries could game the system to access the global model for free or to
sabotage it. In this paper, we propose a novel Robust and Fair Federated
Learning (RFFL) framework to achieve collaborative fairness and adversarial
robustness simultaneously via a reputation mechanism. RFFL maintains a
reputation for each participant by examining their contributions via their
uploaded gradients (using vector similarity) and thus identifies
non-contributing or malicious participants to be removed. Our approach
differentiates itself by not requiring any auxiliary/validation dataset.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that RFFL can achieve high
fairness and is very robust to different types of adversaries while achieving

they are not the most efficient choice for analyzing signals that lie on an

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the development of end-to-end control based on deep learning, it is
important to study new system modeling techniques to realize dynamics modeling
with high-dimensional inputs. In this paper, a novel Koopman-based deep
convolutional network, called CKNet, is proposed to identify latent dynamics
from raw pixels. CKNet learns an encoder and decoder to play the role of the
Koopman eigenfunctions and modes, respectively. The Koopman eigenvalues can be
approximated by eigenvalues of the learned state transition matrix. The
deterministic convolutional Koopman network (DCKNet) and the variational
convolutional Koopman network (VCKNet) are proposed to span some subspace for
approximating the Koopman operator respectively. Because CKNet is trained under
the constraints of the Koopman theory, the identified latent dynamics is in a
linear form and has good interpretability. Besides, the state transition and
control matrices are trained as trainable tensors so that the identified
dynamics is also time-invariant. We also design an auxiliary weight term for
reducing multi-step linearity and prediction losses. Experiments were conducted
on two offline trained and four online trained nonlinear forced dynamical
systems with continuous action spaces in Gym and Mujoco environment
respectively, and the results show that identified dynamics are adequate for
approximating the latent dynamics and generating clear images. Especially for
offline trained cases, this work confirms CKNet from a novel perspective that
we visualize the evolutionary processes of the latent states and the Koopman
eigenfunctions with DCKNet and VCKNet separately to each task based on the same
episode and results demonstrate that different approaches learn similar
features in shapes.]]></summary>

causing gait disturbances. New advances in vision-based human pose-estimation
have opened possibilities for frequent and unobtrusive analysis of gait in
residential settings. This work proposes novel spatial-temporal graph
convolutional network (ST-GCN) architectures and training procedures to predict
clinical scores of parkinsonism in gait from video of individuals with
dementia. We propose a two-stage training approach consisting of a
self-supervised pretraining stage that encourages the ST-GCN model to learn
about gait patterns before predicting clinical scores in the finetuning stage.
The proposed ST-GCN models are evaluated on joint trajectories extracted from
video and are compared against traditional (ordinal, linear, random forest)
regression models and temporal convolutional network baselines. Three 2D human
pose-estimation libraries (OpenPose, Detectron, AlphaPose) and the Microsoft
Kinect (2D and 3D) are used to extract joint trajectories of 4787 natural
walking bouts from 53 older adults with dementia. A subset of 399 walks from 14
participants is annotated with scores of parkinsonism severity on the gait
criteria of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the
Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS). Our results demonstrate that ST-GCN models operating
on 3D joint trajectories extracted from the Kinect consistently outperform all
other models and feature sets. Prediction of parkinsonism scores in natural
walking bouts of unseen participants remains a challenging task, with the best
models achieving macro-averaged F1-scores of 0.53 +/- 0.03 and 0.40 +/- 0.02
for UPDRS-gait and SAS-gait, respectively. Pre-trained model and demo code for

are scarce, we propose a novel estimator of the out-of-sample performance of a
policy in data-driven optimization.Our approach exploits the optimization
problem's sensitivity analysis to estimate the gradient of the optimal
objective value with respect to the amount of noise in the data and uses the
estimated gradient to debias the policy's in-sample performance. Unlike
cross-validation techniques, our approach avoids sacrificing data for a test
set, utilizes all data when training and, hence, is well-suited to settings
where data are scarce. We prove bounds on the bias and variance of our
estimator for optimization problems with uncertain linear objectives but known,
potentially non-convex, feasible regions. For more specialized optimization
problems where the feasible region is ``weakly-coupled" in a certain sense, we
prove stronger results. Specifically, we provide explicit high-probability
bounds on the error of our estimator that hold uniformly over a policy class
and depends on the problem's dimension and policy class's complexity. Our
bounds show that under mild conditions, the error of our estimator vanishes as
the dimension of the optimization problem grows, even if the amount of
available data remains small and constant. Said differently, we prove our
estimator performs well in the small-data, large-scale regime. Finally, we
numerically compare our proposed method to state-of-the-art approaches through
a case-study on dispatching emergency medical response services using real
data. Our method provides more accurate estimates of out-of-sample performance
and learns better-performing policies.]]></summary>

of N distributed edge devices and a parameter server (PS). The objective
function is a sum of the edge devices' local loss functions, who aim to train a
shared model by communicating with the PS over multiple access channels (MAC).
This problem has attracted a growing interest in distributed sensing systems,
and more recently in federated learning, known as over-the-air computation. In
this paper, we develop a novel Accelerated Gradient-descent Multiple Access
(AGMA) algorithm that uses momentum-based gradient signals over noisy fading
MAC to improve the convergence rate as compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, AGMA does not require power control or beamforming to cancel the
fading effect, which simplifies the implementation complexity. We analyze AGMA
theoretically, and establish a finite-sample bound of the error for both convex
and strongly convex loss functions with Lipschitz gradient. For the strongly
convex case, we show that AGMA approaches the best-known linear convergence
rate as the network increases. For the convex case, we show that AGMA
significantly improves the sub-linear convergence rate as compared to existing
methods. Finally, we present simulation results using real datasets that
demonstrate better performance by AGMA.]]></summary>

results through a large-scale training, thus employing models composed of
millions of parameters requiring extensive computational capabilities. Building
such huge models undermines their replicability and increases the training
instability. Moreover, multi-channel data, such as images or audio, are usually
processed by realvalued convolutional networks that flatten and concatenate the
input, often losing intra-channel spatial relations. To address these issues
related to complexity and information loss, we propose a family of
quaternion-valued generative adversarial networks (QGANs). QGANs exploit the
properties of quaternion algebra, e.g., the Hamilton product, that allows to
process channels as a single entity and capture internal latent relations,
while reducing by a factor of 4 the overall number of parameters. We show how
to design QGANs and to extend the proposed approach even to advanced models.We
compare the proposed QGANs with real-valued counterparts on several image
generation benchmarks. Results show that QGANs are able to obtain better FID
scores than real-valued GANs and to generate visually pleasing images.
Furthermore, QGANs save up to 75% of the training parameters. We believe these
results may pave the way to novel, more accessible, GANs capable of improving
performance and saving computational resources.]]></summary>

training overparameterised shallow neural networks and prove new generalisation
and excess risk bounds without the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) or
Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) assumptions. In particular, we show oracle type
bounds which reveal that the generalisation and excess risk of GD is controlled
by an interpolating network with the shortest GD path from initialisation (in a
sense, an interpolating network with the smallest relative norm). While this
was known for kernelised interpolants, our proof applies directly to networks
trained by GD without intermediate kernelisation. At the same time, by relaxing
oracle inequalities developed here we recover existing NTK-based risk bounds in
a straightforward way, which demonstrates that our analysis is tighter.
Finally, unlike most of the NTK-based analyses we focus on regression with
label noise and show that GD with early stopping is consistent.]]></summary>

recommender system results. Deep matrix factorization and their related
collaborative neural networks are the state-of-art in the field; nevertheless,
both models lack the necessary stochasticity to create the robust, continuous,
and structured latent spaces that variational autoencoders exhibit. On the
other hand, data augmentation through variational autoencoder does not provide
accurate results in the collaborative filtering field due to the high sparsity
of recommender systems. Our proposed models apply the variational concept to
inject stochasticity in the latent space of the deep architecture, introducing
the variational technique in the neural collaborative filtering field. This
method does not depend on the particular model used to generate the latent
representation. In this way, this approach can be applied as a plugin to any
current and future specific models. The proposed models have been tested using
four representative open datasets, three different quality measures, and
state-of-art baselines. The results show the superiority of the proposed
approach in scenarios where the variational enrichment exceeds the injected
noise effect. Additionally, a framework is provided to enable the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Driven by the outstanding performance of neural networks in the structured
Euclidean domain, recent years have seen a surge of interest in developing
neural networks for graphs and data supported on graphs. The graph is leveraged
at each layer of the neural network as a parameterization to capture detail at
the node level with a reduced number of parameters and computational
complexity. Following this rationale, this paper puts forth a general framework
that unifies state-of-the-art graph neural networks (GNNs) through the concept
of EdgeNet. An EdgeNet is a GNN architecture that allows different nodes to use
different parameters to weigh the information of different neighbors. By
extrapolating this strategy to more iterations between neighboring nodes, the
EdgeNet learns edge- and neighbor-dependent weights to capture local detail.
This is a general linear and local operation that a node can perform and
encompasses under one formulation all existing graph convolutional neural
networks (GCNNs) as well as graph attention networks (GATs). In writing
different GNN architectures with a common language, EdgeNets highlight specific
architecture advantages and limitations, while providing guidelines to improve
their capacity without compromising their local implementation. An interesting
conclusion is the unification of GCNNs and GATs -- approaches that have been so
far perceived as separate. In particular, we show that GATs are GCNNs on a
graph that is learned from the features. This particularization opens the doors
to develop alternative attention mechanisms for improving discriminatory power.]]></summary>

on local evidences. We consider an occluded point to be one that is imaged in
the first frame but not in the next, a slight overloading of the standard
definition since it also includes points that move out-of-frame. Estimating the
motion of these points is extremely difficult, particularly in the two-frame
setting. Previous work relies on CNNs to learn occlusions, without much
success, or requires multiple frames to reason about occlusions using temporal
smoothness. In this paper, we argue that the occlusion problem can be better
solved in the two-frame case by modelling image self-similarities. We introduce
a global motion aggregation module, a transformer-based approach to find
long-range dependencies between pixels in the first image, and perform global
aggregation on the corresponding motion features. We demonstrate that the
optical flow estimates in the occluded regions can be significantly improved
without damaging the performance in non-occluded regions. This approach obtains
new state-of-the-art results on the challenging Sintel dataset, improving the
average end-point error by 13.6% on Sintel Final and 13.7% on Sintel Clean. At
the time of submission, our method ranks first on these benchmarks among all

underspecified, for example "Can you bring me the wireless mouse?" When viewing
mice on the shelf, the number of buttons or presence of a wire may not be
visible from certain angles or positions. Flat images of candidate mice may not
provide the discriminative information needed for "wireless". The world, and
objects in it, are not flat images but complex 3D shapes. If a human requests
an object based on any of its basic properties, such as color, shape, or
texture, robots should perform the necessary exploration to accomplish the
task. In particular, while substantial effort and progress has been made on
understanding explicitly visual attributes like color and category,
comparatively little progress has been made on understanding language about
shapes and contours. In this work, we introduce a novel reasoning task that
targets both visual and non-visual language about 3D objects. Our new
benchmark, ShapeNet Annotated with Referring Expressions (SNARE), requires a
model to choose which of two objects is being referenced by a natural language
description. We introduce several CLIP-based models for distinguishing objects
and demonstrate that while recent advances in jointly modeling vision and
language are useful for robotic language understanding, it is still the case
that these models are weaker at understanding the 3D nature of objects --
properties which play a key role in manipulation. In particular, we find that
adding view estimation to language grounding models improves accuracy on both
SNARE and when identifying objects referred to in language on a robot platform.]]></summary>

representation overlapping for both memory-based and memory-free methods, we
propose a new CIL framework, Contrastive Class Concentration for CIL (C4IL).
Our framework leverages the class concentration effect of contrastive
representation learning, therefore yielding a representation distribution with
better intra-class compactibility and inter-class separability. Quantitative
experiments showcase our framework that is effective in both memory-based and
memory-free cases: it outperforms the baseline methods of both cases by 5% in
terms of the average and top-1 accuracy in 10-phase and 20-phase CIL.
Qualitative results also demonstrate that our method generates a more compact

their performance. This includes the first work of inducing priors from network
theory into Recurrent Neural Networks and an architectural performance
prediction during a Neural Architecture Search. Within our experiments, we show
how magnitude class blinded pruning achieves 97.5% on MNIST with 80%
compression and re-training, which is 0.5 points more than without compression,
that magnitude class uniform pruning is significantly inferior to it and how a
genetic search enhanced with performance prediction achieves 82.4% on CIFAR10.

given a video of a person with natural motion dynamics. While much progress in
this field has been in single image-based mesh estimation, there has been a
recent uptick in efforts to infer mesh dynamics from video given its role in
alleviating issues such as depth ambiguity and occlusions. However, a key
limitation of existing work is the assumption that all the observed motion
dynamics can be modeled using one dynamical/recurrent model. While this may
work well in cases with relatively simplistic dynamics, inference with
in-the-wild videos presents many challenges. In particular, it is typically the
case that different body parts of a person undergo different dynamics in the
video, e.g., legs may move in a way that may be dynamically different from
hands (e.g., a person dancing). To address these issues, we present a new
method for video mesh recovery that divides the human mesh into several local
parts following the standard skeletal model. We then model the dynamics of each
local part with separate recurrent models, with each model conditioned
appropriately based on the known kinematic structure of the human body. This
results in a structure-informed local recurrent learning architecture that can
be trained in an end-to-end fashion with available annotations. We conduct a
variety of experiments on standard video mesh recovery benchmark datasets such
as Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW, demonstrating the efficacy of our design
of modeling local dynamics as well as establishing state-of-the-art results
based on standard evaluation metrics.]]></summary>

constructing a causal graph involves combining knowledge with machine learning,
this approach remains underused in practice. We implement and evaluate 10
knowledge approaches with application to different case studies and BN
structure learning algorithms available in the open-source Bayesys structure

comparative evaluation of a wide range of knowledge approaches for BN structure
learning. Because the value of knowledge depends on what data are available, we
illustrate the results both with limited and big data. While the overall
results show that knowledge becomes less important with big data due to higher
learning accuracy rendering knowledge less important, some of the knowledge
approaches are actually found to be more important with big data. Amongst the
main conclusions is the observation that reduced search space obtained from
knowledge does not always imply reduced computational complexity, perhaps
because the relationships implied by the data and knowledge are in tension.]]></summary>

the use of a barrier function can be needlessly restrictive. In particular, we
examine the case of fixed wing collision avoidance and show that when using a
barrier function, there are cases where two fixed wing aircraft can come closer
to colliding than if there were no barrier function at all. In addition, we
construct cases where the barrier function labels the system as unsafe even
when the vehicles start arbitrarily far apart. In other words, the barrier
function ensures safety but with unnecessary costs to performance. We therefore
introduce model free barrier functions which take a data driven approach to
creating a barrier function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of model free

one-shot before training starts, evaluate sparse architectures with the help of
a single criterion -- called pruning score. Pruning weights based on a solitary
score works well for some architectures and pruning rates but may also fail for
other ones. As a common baseline for pruning scores, we introduce the notion of
a generalized synaptic score (GSS). In this work we do not concentrate on a
single pruning criterion, but provide a framework for combining arbitrary GSSs
to create more powerful pruning strategies. These COmbined Pruning Scores
(COPS) are obtained by solving a constrained optimization problem. Optimizing
for more than one score prevents the sparse network to overly specialize on an
individual task, thus COntrols Pruning before training Starts. The
combinatorial optimization problem given by COPS is relaxed on a linear program
(LP). This LP is solved analytically and determines a solution for COPS.
Furthermore, an algorithm to compute it for two scores numerically is proposed
and evaluated. Solving COPS in such a way has lower complexity than the best
general LP solver. In our experiments we compared pruning with COPS against
state-of-the-art methods for different network architectures and image

purely data-driven and in general does not require physics. This is the
strength of DL but also one of its key limitations when applied to science and
engineering problems in which underlying physical properties (such as
stability, conservation, and positivity) and desired accuracy need to be
achieved. DL methods in their original forms are not capable of respecting the
underlying mathematical models or achieving desired accuracy even in big-data
regimes. On the other hand, many data-driven science and engineering problems,
such as inverse problems, typically have limited experimental or observational
data, and DL would overfit the data in this case. Leveraging information
encoded in the underlying mathematical models, we argue, not only compensates
missing information in low data regimes but also provides opportunities to
equip DL methods with the underlying physics and hence obtaining higher
accuracy. This short communication introduces several model-constrained DL
approaches (including both feed-forward DNN and autoencoders) that are capable
of learning not only information hidden in the training data but also in the
underlying mathematical models to solve inverse problems. We present and
provide intuitions for our formulations for general nonlinear problems. For
linear inverse problems and linear networks, the first order optimality
conditions show that our model-constrained DL approaches can learn information
encoded in the underlying mathematical models, and thus can produce consistent

usually trained to operate on a predefined closed set of object classes. This
is in contrast to the "open world" setting where DNNs are envisioned to be
deployed to. From a functional safety point of view, the ability to detect
so-called "out-of-distribution" (OoD) samples, i.e., objects outside of a DNN's
semantic space, is crucial for many applications such as automated driving. A
natural baseline approach to OoD detection is to threshold on the pixel-wise
softmax entropy. We present a two-step procedure that significantly improves
that approach. Firstly, we utilize samples from the COCO dataset as OoD proxy
and introduce a second training objective to maximize the softmax entropy on
these samples. Starting from pretrained semantic segmentation networks we
re-train a number of DNNs on different in-distribution datasets and
consistently observe improved OoD detection performance when evaluating on
completely disjoint OoD datasets. Secondly, we perform a transparent
post-processing step to discard false positive OoD samples by so-called "meta
classification". To this end, we apply linear models to a set of hand-crafted
metrics derived from the DNN's softmax probabilities. In our experiments we
consistently observe a clear additional gain in OoD detection performance,
cutting down the number of detection errors by up to 52% when comparing the
best baseline with our results. We achieve this improvement sacrificing only
marginally in original segmentation performance. Therefore, our method
contributes to safer DNNs with more reliable overall system performance.]]></summary>

modalities. In this paper, we propose a new system to discriminatively embed
the image and text to a shared visual-textual space. In this field, most
existing works apply the ranking loss to pull the positive image / text pairs
close and push the negative pairs apart from each other. However, directly
deploying the ranking loss is hard for network learning, since it starts from
the two heterogeneous features to build inter-modal relationship. To address
this problem, we propose the instance loss which explicitly considers the
intra-modal data distribution. It is based on an unsupervised assumption that
each image / text group can be viewed as a class. So the network can learn the
fine granularity from every image/text group. The experiment shows that the
instance loss offers better weight initialization for the ranking loss, so that
more discriminative embeddings can be learned. Besides, existing works usually
apply the off-the-shelf features, i.e., word2vec and fixed visual feature. So
in a minor contribution, this paper constructs an end-to-end dual-path
convolutional network to learn the image and text representations. End-to-end
learning allows the system to directly learn from the data and fully utilize
the supervision. On two generic retrieval datasets (Flickr30k and MSCOCO),
experiments demonstrate that our method yields competitive accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, in language based person retrieval, we
improve the state of the art by a large margin. The code has been made publicly

past few years and have been applied to numerous multimedia applications such
as video understanding. However, the current training pipeline for dense
detectors is compromised to lots of conjunctions that may not hold. In this
paper, we investigate three such important conjunctions: 1) only samples
assigned as positive in classification head are used to train the regression
head; 2) classification and regression share the same input feature and
computational fields defined by the parallel head architecture; and 3) samples
distributed in different feature pyramid layers are treated equally when
computing the loss. We first carry out a series of pilot experiments to show
disentangling such conjunctions can lead to persistent performance improvement.
Then, based on these findings, we propose Disentangled Dense Object Detector
(DDOD), in which simple and effective disentanglement mechanisms are designed
and integrated into the current state-of-the-art dense object detectors.
Extensive experiments on MS COCO benchmark show that our approach can lead to
2.0 mAP, 2.4 mAP and 2.2 mAP absolute improvements on RetinaNet, FCOS, and ATSS
baselines with negligible extra overhead. Notably, our best model reaches 55.0
mAP on the COCO test-dev set and 93.5 AP on the hard subset of WIDER FACE,

weights in overparameterized networks. Most of the existing techniques first
remove structured sub-networks (filters, channels,...) and then fine-tune the
resulting networks to maintain a high accuracy. However, removing a whole
structure is a strong topological prior and recovering the accuracy, with
fine-tuning, is highly cumbersome. In this paper, we introduce an "end-to-end"
lightweight network design that achieves training and pruning simultaneously
without fine-tuning. The design principle of our method relies on
reparametrization that learns not only the weights but also the topological
structure of the lightweight sub-network. This reparametrization acts as a
prior (or regularizer) that defines pruning masks implicitly from the weights
of the underlying network, without increasing the number of training
parameters. Sparsity is induced with a budget loss that provides an accurate
pruning. Extensive experiments conducted on the CIFAR10 and the TinyImageNet
datasets, using standard architectures (namely Conv4, VGG19 and ResNet18), show

proven to be effective in biomedical image segmentation. However, U-Net applies
skip connections to merge semantically different low- and high-level
convolutional features, resulting in not only blurred feature maps, but also
over- and under-segmented target regions. To address these limitations, we
propose a simple, yet effective end-to-end depthwise encoder-decoder fully
convolutional network architecture, called Sharp U-Net, for binary and
multi-class biomedical image segmentation. The key rationale of Sharp U-Net is
that instead of applying a plain skip connection, a depthwise convolution of
the encoder feature map with a sharpening kernel filter is employed prior to
merging the encoder and decoder features, thereby producing a sharpened
intermediate feature map of the same size as the encoder map. Using this
sharpening filter layer, we are able to not only fuse semantically less
dissimilar features, but also to smooth out artifacts throughout the network
layers during the early stages of training. Our extensive experiments on six
datasets show that the proposed Sharp U-Net model consistently outperforms or
matches the recent state-of-the-art baselines in both binary and multi-class

Sharp U-Net outperforms baselines that have more than three times the number of

osteoarthritis (OA) can address the limitation of the current OA assessment.
Segmentation of bone, cartilage, and joint fluid is necessary for the OA
objective assessment. Most of the proposed segmentation methods are not
performing instance segmentation and suffer from class imbalance problems. This
study deployed Mask R-CNN instance segmentation and improved it (improved-Mask
R-CNN (iMaskRCNN)) to obtain a more accurate generalized segmentation for
OA-associated tissues. Training and validation of the method were performed
using 500 MRI knees from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset and 97 MRI
scans of patients with symptomatic hip OA. Three modifications to Mask R-CNN
yielded the iMaskRCNN: adding a 2nd ROIAligned block, adding an extra decoder
layer to the mask-header, and connecting them by a skip connection. The results
were assessed using Hausdorff distance, dice score, and coefficients of
variation (CoV). The iMaskRCNN led to improved bone and cartilage segmentation
compared to Mask RCNN as indicated with the increase in dice score from 95% to
98% for the femur, 95% to 97% for tibia, 71% to 80% for femoral cartilage, and
81% to 82% for tibial cartilage. For the effusion detection, dice improved with
iMaskRCNN 72% versus MaskRCNN 71%. The CoV values for effusion detection
between Reader1 and Mask R-CNN (0.33), Reader1 and iMaskRCNN (0.34), Reader2
and Mask R-CNN (0.22), Reader2 and iMaskRCNN (0.29) are close to CoV between
two readers (0.21), indicating a high agreement between the human readers and
both Mask R-CNN and iMaskRCNN. Mask R-CNN and iMaskRCNN can reliably and
simultaneously extract different scale articular tissues involved in OA,
forming the foundation for automated assessment of OA. The iMaskRCNN results
show that the modification improved the network performance around the edges.]]></summary>

feasible to move from population-wide models that are useful to discover
aggregate patterns that hold for group-based analysis to patient-specific
models that can drive patient-specific decisions with regard to treatment
choices, and predictions of outcomes of treatment. Body Composition is
recognized as an important driver and risk factor for a wide variety of
diseases, as well as a predictor of individual patient-specific clinical
outcomes to treatment choices or surgical interventions. 3D CT images are
routinely acquired in the oncological worklows and deliver accurate rendering
of internal anatomy and therefore can be used opportunistically to assess the
amount of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue compartments. Powerful tools of
artificial intelligence such as deep learning are making it feasible now to
segment the entire 3D image and generate accurate measurements of all internal
anatomy. These will enable the overcoming of the severe bottleneck that existed
previously, namely, the need for manual segmentation, which was prohibitive to
scale to the hundreds of 2D axial slices that made up a 3D volumetric image.
Automated tools such as presented here will now enable harvesting whole-body
measurements from 3D CT or MRI images, leading to a new era of discovery of the
drivers of various diseases based on individual tissue, organ volume, shape,
and functional status. These measurements were hitherto unavailable thereby
limiting the field to a very small and limited subset. These discoveries and
the potential to perform individual image segmentation with high speed and
accuracy are likely to lead to the incorporation of these 3D measures into
individual specific treatment planning models related to nutrition, aging,
chemotoxicity, surgery and survival after the onset of a major disease such as

performance on various image restoration tasks. However, this comes at a price
of increasing computational burden, hence limiting their practical usages. We
observe that some corrupted image regions are inherently easier to restore than
others since the distortion and content vary within an image. To leverage this,
we propose Path-Restore, a multi-path CNN with a pathfinder that can
dynamically select an appropriate route for each image region. We train the
pathfinder using reinforcement learning with a difficulty-regulated reward.
This reward is related to the performance, complexity and "the difficulty of
restoring a region". A policy mask is further investigated to jointly process
all the image regions. We conduct experiments on denoising and mixed
restoration tasks. The results show that our method achieves comparable or
superior performance to existing approaches with less computational cost. In
particular, Path-Restore is effective for real-world denoising, where the noise
distribution varies across different regions on a single image. Compared to the
state-of-the-art RIDNet, our method achieves comparable performance and runs
2.7x faster on the realistic Darmstadt Noise Dataset.]]></summary>

the existing ISIC and PH2 skin lesion classification datasets. This dataset
contains annotations of visual ABC (asymmetry, border, colour) features from
non-expert annotation sources: undergraduate students, crowd workers from
Amazon MTurk and classic image processing algorithms. In this paper we first
analyse the correlations between the annotations and the diagnostic label of
the lesion, as well as study the agreement between different annotation
sources. Overall we find weak correlations of non-expert annotations with the
diagnostic label, and low agreement between different annotation sources. We
then study multi-task learning (MTL) with the annotations as additional labels,
and show that non-expert annotations can improve (ensembles of)
state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks via MTL. We hope that our

one-shot before training starts, evaluate sparse architectures with the help of
a single criterion -- called pruning score. Pruning weights based on a solitary
score works well for some architectures and pruning rates but may also fail for
other ones. As a common baseline for pruning scores, we introduce the notion of
a generalized synaptic score (GSS). In this work we do not concentrate on a
single pruning criterion, but provide a framework for combining arbitrary GSSs
to create more powerful pruning strategies. These COmbined Pruning Scores
(COPS) are obtained by solving a constrained optimization problem. Optimizing
for more than one score prevents the sparse network to overly specialize on an
individual task, thus COntrols Pruning before training Starts. The
combinatorial optimization problem given by COPS is relaxed on a linear program
(LP). This LP is solved analytically and determines a solution for COPS.
Furthermore, an algorithm to compute it for two scores numerically is proposed
and evaluated. Solving COPS in such a way has lower complexity than the best
general LP solver. In our experiments we compared pruning with COPS against
state-of-the-art methods for different network architectures and image
classification tasks and obtained improved results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated learning has arisen as a mechanism to allow multiple participants
to collaboratively train a model without sharing their data. In these settings,
participants (workers) may not trust each other fully; for instance, a set of
competitors may collaboratively train a machine learning model to detect fraud.
The workers provide local gradients that a central server uses to update a
global model. This global model can be corrupted when Byzantine workers send
malicious gradients, which necessitates robust methods for aggregating
gradients that mitigate the adverse effects of Byzantine inputs. Existing
robust aggregation algorithms are often computationally expensive and only
effective under strict assumptions. In this paper, we introduce LayerwisE
Gradient AggregatTiOn (LEGATO), an aggregation algorithm that is, by contrast,
scalable and generalizable. Informed by a study of layer-specific responses of
gradients to Byzantine attacks, LEGATO employs a dynamic gradient reweighing
scheme that is novel in its treatment of gradients based on layer-specific
robustness. We show that LEGATO is more computationally efficient than multiple
state-of-the-art techniques and more generally robust across a variety of
attack settings in practice. We also demonstrate LEGATO's benefits for gradient
descent convergence in the absence of an attack.]]></summary>

competitive results for visual tasks, but fail to consider high-level local
pattern information in input images. In this paper, we present a generic
Dual-stream Network (DS-Net) to fully explore the representation capacity of

simultaneously calculate fine-grained and integrated features and efficiently

process two different resolutions in each block and an Inter-Scale Alignment
module to perform information interaction across features at dual scales.
Besides, we also design a Dual-stream FPN (DS-FPN) to further enhance
contextual information for downstream dense predictions. Without bells and
whistles, the propsed DS-Net outperforms Deit-Small by 2.4% in terms of top-1
accuracy on ImageNet-1k and achieves state-of-the-art performance over other
Vision Transformers and ResNets. For object detection and instance

to change the way we commute. Much effort has been put into trying to estimate
the state of a vehicle. Meanwhile, learning to forecast the state of a vehicle
ahead introduces new capabilities, such as predicting dangerous situations.
Moreover, forecasting brings new supervision opportunities by learning to
predict richer a context, expressed by multiple horizons. Intuitively, a video
stream originated from a front-facing camera is necessary because it encodes
information about the upcoming road. Besides, historical traces of the
vehicle's states give more context. In this paper, we tackle multi-horizon
forecasting of vehicle states by fusing the two modalities. We design and
experiment with 3 end-to-end architectures that exploit 3D convolutions for
visual features extraction and 1D convolutions for features extraction from
speed and steering angle traces. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method, we perform extensive experiments on two publicly available real-world
datasets, Comma2k19 and the Udacity challenge. We show that we are able to
forecast a vehicle's state to various horizons, while outperforming the current
state-of-the-art results on the related task of driving state estimation. We
examine the contribution of vision features, and find that a model fed with
vision features achieves an error that is 56.6% and 66.9% of the error of a
model that doesn't use those features, on the Udacity and Comma2k19 datasets
respectively.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image denoising are usually
trained on large datasets. These models achieve the current state of the art,
but they have difficulties generalizing when applied to data that deviate from
the training distribution. Recent work has shown that it is possible to train
denoisers on a single noisy image. These models adapt to the features of the
test image, but their performance is limited by the small amount of information
used to train them. Here we propose "GainTuning", in which CNN models
pre-trained on large datasets are adaptively and selectively adjusted for
individual test images. To avoid overfitting, GainTuning optimizes a single
multiplicative scaling parameter (the "Gain") of each channel in the
convolutional layers of the CNN. We show that GainTuning improves
state-of-the-art CNNs on standard image-denoising benchmarks, boosting their
denoising performance on nearly every image in a held-out test set. These
adaptive improvements are even more substantial for test images differing
systematically from the training data, either in noise level or image type. We
illustrate the potential of adaptive denoising in a scientific application, in
which a CNN is trained on synthetic data, and tested on real
transmission-electron-microscope images. In contrast to the existing
methodology, GainTuning is able to faithfully reconstruct the structure of
catalytic nanoparticles from these data at extremely low signal-to-noise
ratios.]]></summary>

However, the representation learning ability of the generator is limited since

as effective as discriminator. In order to improve the representation learning

representation by reconstruction error, but the guidance of discriminator, and
could benefit from pretext tasks designed for discriminative methods. Our
discriminative-generative representation learning method has performance close

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Autonomous assembly of objects is an essential task in robotics and 3D
computer vision. It has been studied extensively in robotics as a problem of
motion planning, actuator control and obstacle avoidance. However, the task of
developing a generalized framework for assembly robust to structural variants
remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we tackle this problem using a
recurrent graph learning framework considering inter-part relations and the
progressive update of the part pose. Our network can learn more plausible
predictions of shape structure by accounting for priorly assembled parts.
Compared to the current state-of-the-art, our network yields up to 10%
improvement in part accuracy and up to 15% improvement in connectivity accuracy
on the PartNet dataset. Moreover, our resulting latent space facilitates
exciting applications such as shape recovery from the point-cloud components.
We conduct extensive experiments to justify our design choices and demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed framework.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the superiority of Transformer in learning long-term dependency, the
sign language Transformer model achieves remarkable progress in Sign Language
Recognition (SLR) and Translation (SLT). However, there are several issues with
the Transformer that prevent it from better sign language understanding. The
first issue is that the self-attention mechanism learns sign video
representation in a frame-wise manner, neglecting the temporal semantic
structure of sign gestures. Secondly, the attention mechanism with absolute
position encoding is direction and distance unaware, thus limiting its ability.
To address these issues, we propose a new model architecture, namely PiSLTRc,
with two distinctive characteristics: (i) content-aware and position-aware
convolution layers. Specifically, we explicitly select relevant features using
a novel content-aware neighborhood gathering method. Then we aggregate these
features with position-informed temporal convolution layers, thus generating
robust neighborhood-enhanced sign representation. (ii) injecting the relative
position information to the attention mechanism in the encoder, decoder, and
even encoder-decoder cross attention. Compared with the vanilla Transformer
model, our model performs consistently better on three large-scale sign
language benchmarks: PHOENIX-2014, PHOENIX-2014-T and CSL. Furthermore,
extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on translation quality with $+1.6$ BLEU
improvements.]]></summary>

using low-cost cameras, in particular for presentation attack detection
purposes. Depth video output from these capture devices can however contain
defects such as holes or general depth inaccuracies. This work proposes a deep
learning face depth enhancement method in this context of facial biometrics,
which adds a security aspect to the topic. U-Net-like architectures are
utilized, and the networks are compared against hand-crafted enhancer types, as
well as a similar depth enhancer network from related work trained for an
adjacent application scenario. All tested enhancer types exclusively use depth
data as input, which differs from methods that enhance depth based on
additional input data such as visible light color images. Synthetic face depth
ground truth images and degraded forms thereof are created with help of PRNet,
to train multiple deep learning enhancer models with different network sizes
and training configurations. Evaluations are carried out on the synthetic data,
on Kinect v1 images from the KinectFaceDB, and on in-house RealSense D435
images. These evaluations include an assessment of the falsification for
occluded face depth input, which is relevant to biometric security. The
proposed deep learning enhancers yield noticeably better results than the
tested preexisting enhancers, without overly falsifying depth data when
non-face input is provided, and are shown to reduce the error of a simple
landmark-based PAD method.]]></summary>

is, in fact, an artifact of not tuning the learning rates. After carefully
redesigning the empirical setup, we find that when tuning learning rates
properly, pretrained transformers do outperform or match training from scratch

while transfer from pretrained language models to other modalities does indeed

is important to ensure safe approaches to passenger vehicle automation. Models
which contain contextual, semantically meaningful representations of driver
states can be used to determine the appropriate timing and conditions for
transfer of control between driver and vehicle. However, such models rely on
real-world control take-over data from drivers engaged in distracting
activities, which is costly to collect. Here, we introduce a scheme for data
augmentation for such a dataset. Using the augmented dataset, we develop and
train take-over time (TOT) models that operate sequentially on mid and
high-level features produced by computer vision algorithms operating on
different driver-facing camera views, showing models trained on the augmented
dataset to outperform the initial dataset. The demonstrated model features
encode different aspects of the driver state, pertaining to the face, hands,
foot and upper body of the driver. We perform ablative experiments on feature
combinations as well as model architectures, showing that a TOT model supported
by augmented data can be used to produce continuous estimates of take-over

given a video of a person with natural motion dynamics. While much progress in
this field has been in single image-based mesh estimation, there has been a
recent uptick in efforts to infer mesh dynamics from video given its role in
alleviating issues such as depth ambiguity and occlusions. However, a key
limitation of existing work is the assumption that all the observed motion
dynamics can be modeled using one dynamical/recurrent model. While this may
work well in cases with relatively simplistic dynamics, inference with
in-the-wild videos presents many challenges. In particular, it is typically the
case that different body parts of a person undergo different dynamics in the
video, e.g., legs may move in a way that may be dynamically different from
hands (e.g., a person dancing). To address these issues, we present a new
method for video mesh recovery that divides the human mesh into several local
parts following the standard skeletal model. We then model the dynamics of each
local part with separate recurrent models, with each model conditioned
appropriately based on the known kinematic structure of the human body. This
results in a structure-informed local recurrent learning architecture that can
be trained in an end-to-end fashion with available annotations. We conduct a
variety of experiments on standard video mesh recovery benchmark datasets such
as Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW, demonstrating the efficacy of our design
of modeling local dynamics as well as establishing state-of-the-art results
based on standard evaluation metrics.]]></summary>

works of fiction possess specific properties making these tasks harder. This
survey aims at presenting and organizing the scientific literature related to
the extraction of character networks from works of fiction, as well as their
analysis. We first describe the extraction process in a generic way, and
explain how its constituting steps are implemented in practice, depending on
the medium of the narrative, the goal of the network analysis, and other
factors. We then review the descriptive tools used to characterize character
networks, with a focus on the way they are interpreted in this context. We
illustrate the relevance of character networks by also providing a review of
applications derived from their analysis. Finally, we identify the limitations
of the existing approaches, and the most promising perspectives.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continuous sign language recognition (cSLR) is a public significant task that
transcribes a sign language video into an ordered gloss sequence. It is
important to capture the fine-grained gloss-level details, since there is no
explicit alignment between sign video frames and the corresponding glosses.
Among the past works, one promising way is to adopt a one-dimensional
convolutional network (1D-CNN) to temporally fuse the sequential frames.
However, CNNs are agnostic to similarity or dissimilarity, and thus are unable
to capture local consistent semantics within temporally neighboring frames. To
address the issue, we propose to adaptively fuse local features via temporal
similarity for this task. Specifically, we devise a Multi-scale Local-Temporal
Similarity Fusion Network (mLTSF-Net) as follows: 1) In terms of a specific
video frame, we firstly select its similar neighbours with multi-scale
receptive regions to accommodate different lengths of glosses. 2) To ensure
temporal consistency, we then use position-aware convolution to temporally
convolve each scale of selected frames. 3) To obtain a local-temporally
enhanced frame-wise representation, we finally fuse the results of different
scales using a content-dependent aggregator. We train our model in an
end-to-end fashion, and the experimental results on RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014
datasets (RWTH) demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance
compared with several state-of-the-art models.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3D deep learning has been increasingly more popular for a variety of tasks
including many safety-critical applications. However, recently several works
raise the security issues of 3D deep nets. Although most of these works
consider adversarial attacks, we identify that backdoor attack is indeed a more
serious threat to 3D deep learning systems but remains unexplored. We present
the backdoor attacks in 3D with a unified framework that exploits the unique
properties of 3D data and networks. In particular, we design two attack
approaches: the poison-label attack and the clean-label attack. The first one
is straightforward and effective in practice, while the second one is more
sophisticated assuming there are certain data inspections. The attack
algorithms are mainly motivated and developed by 1) the recent discovery of 3D
adversarial samples which demonstrate the vulnerability of 3D deep nets under
spatial transformations; 2) the proposed feature disentanglement technique that
manipulates the feature of the data through optimization methods and its
potential to embed a new task. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of the
poison-label attack with over 95% success rate across several 3D datasets and
models, and the ability of clean-label attack against data filtering with
around 50% success rate. Our proposed backdoor attack in 3D point cloud is
expected to perform as a baseline for improving the robustness of 3D deep
models.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been shown to be susceptible to memorization
or overfitting in the presence of noisily labelled data. For the problem of
robust learning under such noisy data, several algorithms have been proposed. A
prominent class of algorithms rely on sample selection strategies, motivated by
curriculum learning. For example, many algorithms use the `small loss trick'
wherein a fraction of samples with loss values below a certain threshold are
selected for training. These algorithms are sensitive to such thresholds, and
it is difficult to fix or learn these thresholds. Often, these algorithms also
require information such as label noise rates which are typically unavailable
in practice. In this paper, we propose a data-dependent, adaptive sample
selection strategy that relies only on batch statistics of a given mini-batch
to provide robustness against label noise. The algorithm does not have any
additional hyperparameters for sample selection, does not need any information
on noise rates, and does not need access to separate data with clean labels. We
empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on benchmark
datasets.]]></summary>

of classes, and need pre-collected datasets in advance. However, new classes
often emerge in real-world applications and should be learned incrementally.
For example, in electronic commerce, new types of products appear daily, and in
a social media community, new topics emerge frequently. Under such
circumstances, incremental models should learn several new classes at a time
without forgetting. We find a strong correlation between old and new classes in
incremental learning, which can be applied to relate and facilitate different
learning stages mutually. As a result, we propose CO-transport for class
Incremental Learning (COIL), which learns to relate across incremental tasks
with the class-wise semantic relationship. In detail, co-transport has two
aspects: prospective transport tries to augment the old classifier with optimal
transported knowledge as fast model adaptation. Retrospective transport aims to
transport new class classifiers backward as old ones to overcome forgetting.
With these transports, COIL efficiently adapts to new tasks, and stably resists
forgetting. Experiments on benchmark and real-world multimedia datasets
validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.]]></summary>

Both accuracy and inference time are meaningful for a lot of them. While the
number of FLOPs is usually used as a proxy for neural network latency, it may
be not the best choice. In order to obtain a better approximation of latency,
research community uses look-up tables of all possible layers for latency
calculation for the final prediction of the inference on mobile CPU. It
requires only a small number of experiments. Unfortunately, on mobile GPU this
method is not applicable in a straight-forward way and shows low precision. In
this work, we consider latency approximation on mobile GPU as a data and
hardware-specific problem. Our main goal is to construct a convenient latency
estimation tool for investigation(LETI) of neural network inference and
building robust and accurate latency prediction models for each specific task.
To achieve this goal, we build open-source tools which provide a convenient way
to conduct massive experiments on different target devices focusing on mobile
GPU. After evaluation of the dataset, we learn the regression model on
experimental data and use it for future latency prediction and analysis. We
experimentally demonstrate the applicability of such an approach on a subset of
popular NAS-Benchmark 101 dataset and also evaluate the most popular neural
network architectures for two mobile GPUs. As a result, we construct latency
prediction model with good precision on the target evaluation subset. We
consider LETI as a useful tool for neural architecture search or massive

causing premature deaths. Therefore, it is necessary to devise systems to
prevent accidents in advance and respond proactively, using potential risky
situations as one of the surrogate safety measurements. This study introduces a
new concept of a pedestrian safety system that combines the field and the
centralized processes. The system can warn of upcoming risks immediately in the
field and improve the safety of risk frequent areas by assessing the safety
levels of roads without actual collisions. In particular, this study focuses on
the latter by introducing a new analytical framework for a crosswalk safety
assessment with behaviors of vehicle/pedestrian and environmental features. We
obtain these behavioral features from actual traffic video footage in the city
with complete automatic processing. The proposed framework mainly analyzes
these behaviors in multidimensional perspectives by constructing a data cube
structure, which combines the LSTM based predictive collision risk estimation
model and the on line analytical processing operations. From the PCR estimation
model, we categorize the severity of risks as four levels and apply the
proposed framework to assess the crosswalk safety with behavioral features. Our
analytic experiments are based on two scenarios, and the various descriptive
results are harvested the movement patterns of vehicles and pedestrians by road
environment and the relationships between risk levels and car speeds. Thus, the
proposed framework can support decision makers by providing valuable
information to improve pedestrian safety for future accidents, and it can help
us better understand their behaviors near crosswalks proactively. In order to
confirm the feasibility and applicability of the proposed framework, we
implement and apply it to actual operating CCTVs in Osan City, Korea.]]></summary>

for several decades, as researchers have worked on increasingly challenging
tasks. In the 1990's it was discovered, that conversational speech between two
humans turns out to be considerably more difficult than read speech as
hesitations, disfluencies, false starts and sloppy articulation complicate
acoustic processing and require robust handling of acoustic, lexical and
language context, jointly. Early attempts with statistical models could only
reach error rates over 50% and far from human performance (WER of around 5.5%).
Neural hybrid models and recent attention-based encoder-decoder models have
considerably improved performance as such contexts can now be learned in an
integral fashion. However, processing such contexts requires an entire
utterance presentation and thus introduces unwanted delays before a recognition
result can be output. In this paper, we address performance as well as latency.
We present results for a system that can achieve super-human performance (at a
WER of 5.0%, over the Switchboard conversational benchmark) at a word based
latency of only 1 second behind a speaker's speech. The system uses multiple
attention-based encoder-decoder networks integrated within a novel low latency
incremental inference approach.]]></summary>

carrier vehicle allows more flexibility in real applications such as rescue in
dangerous scenarios. The autonomous recovery system, which is used to guide the
small UGV back to the carrier vehicle, is an essential component to achieve a
seamless combination of the two vehicles. This paper proposes a novel
autonomous recovery framework with a low-cost monocular vision system to
provide accurate positioning and attitude estimation of the UGV during
navigation. First, we introduce a light-weight convolutional neural network
called UGV-KPNet to detect the keypoints of the small UGV from the images
captured by a monocular camera. UGV-KPNet is computationally efficient with a
small number of parameters and provides pixel-level accurate keypoints
detection results in real-time. Then, six degrees of freedom pose is estimated
using the detected keypoints to obtain positioning and attitude information of
the UGV. Besides, we are the first to create a large-scale real-world keypoints
dataset of the UGV. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
system achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We consider the abstract relational reasoning task, which is commonly used as
an intelligence test. Since some patterns have spatial rationales, while others
are only semantic, we propose a multi-scale architecture that processes each
query in multiple resolutions. We show that indeed different rules are solved
by different resolutions and a combined multi-scale approach outperforms the
existing state of the art in this task on all benchmarks by 5-54%. The success
of our method is shown to arise from multiple novelties. First, it searches for
relational patterns in multiple resolutions, which allows it to readily detect
visual relations, such as location, in higher resolution, while allowing the
lower resolution module to focus on semantic relations, such as shape type.
Second, we optimize the reasoning network of each resolution proportionally to
its performance, hereby we motivate each resolution to specialize on the rules
for which it performs better than the others and ignore cases that are already
solved by the other resolutions. Third, we propose a new way to pool
information along the rows and the columns of the illustration-grid of the
query. Our work also analyses the existing benchmarks, demonstrating that the
RAVEN dataset selects the negative examples in a way that is easily exploited.
We, therefore, propose a modified version of the RAVEN dataset, named
RAVEN-FAIR. Our code and pretrained models are available at

sparsity of the component points. Many of the recently proposed methods like
PointNet and PointCNN have been focusing on learning shape descriptions from
point coordinates as point-wise input features, which usually involves
complicated network architectures. In this work, we draw attention back to the
standard 3D convolutions towards an efficient 3D point cloud interpretation.
Instead of converting the entire point cloud into voxel representations like
the other volumetric methods, we voxelize the sub-portions of the point cloud
only at necessary locations within each convolution layer on-the-fly, using our
dynamic voxelization operation with self-adaptive voxelization resolution. In
addition, we incorporate 3D group convolution into our dense convolution kernel
implementation to further exploit the rotation invariant features of point
cloud. Benefiting from its simple fully-convolutional architecture, our network
is able to run and converge at a considerably fast speed, while yields on-par
or even better performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods on
several benchmark datasets.]]></summary>

causing gait disturbances. New advances in vision-based human pose-estimation
have opened possibilities for frequent and unobtrusive analysis of gait in
residential settings. This work proposes novel spatial-temporal graph
convolutional network (ST-GCN) architectures and training procedures to predict
clinical scores of parkinsonism in gait from video of individuals with
dementia. We propose a two-stage training approach consisting of a
self-supervised pretraining stage that encourages the ST-GCN model to learn
about gait patterns before predicting clinical scores in the finetuning stage.
The proposed ST-GCN models are evaluated on joint trajectories extracted from
video and are compared against traditional (ordinal, linear, random forest)
regression models and temporal convolutional network baselines. Three 2D human
pose-estimation libraries (OpenPose, Detectron, AlphaPose) and the Microsoft
Kinect (2D and 3D) are used to extract joint trajectories of 4787 natural
walking bouts from 53 older adults with dementia. A subset of 399 walks from 14
participants is annotated with scores of parkinsonism severity on the gait
criteria of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the
Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS). Our results demonstrate that ST-GCN models operating
on 3D joint trajectories extracted from the Kinect consistently outperform all
other models and feature sets. Prediction of parkinsonism scores in natural
walking bouts of unseen participants remains a challenging task, with the best
models achieving macro-averaged F1-scores of 0.53 +/- 0.03 and 0.40 +/- 0.02
for UPDRS-gait and SAS-gait, respectively. Pre-trained model and demo code for
this work is available:

intelligence (AI) have led to the development of challenging tasks at the
intersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Embodied AI.
Whereas many approaches and previous survey pursuits have characterised one or
two of these dimensions, there has not been a holistic analysis at the center
of all three. Moreover, even when combinations of these topics are considered,
more focus is placed on describing, e.g., current architectural methods, as
opposed to also illustrating high-level challenges and opportunities for the
field. In this survey paper, we discuss Embodied Vision-Language Planning
(EVLP) tasks, a family of prominent embodied navigation and manipulation
problems that jointly use computer vision and natural language. We propose a
taxonomy to unify these tasks and provide an in-depth analysis and comparison
of the new and current algorithmic approaches, metrics, simulated environments,
as well as the datasets used for EVLP tasks. Finally, we present the core
challenges that we believe new EVLP works should seek to address, and we
advocate for task construction that enables model generalizability and furthers

significant modality gap and the large intra-class variance in textual

this paper, we propose a Semantically Self-Aligned Network (SSAN) to handle the

design a multi-view non-local network that captures the relationships between

noun phrases. Third, we introduce a Compound Ranking (CR) loss that makes use
of textual descriptions for other images of the same identity to provide extra

features. Finally, to expedite future research in text-to-image ReID, we build
a new database named ICFG-PEDES. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSAN
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by significant margins. Both the new

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Localizing individuals in crowds is more in accordance with the practical
demands of subsequent high-level crowd analysis tasks than simply counting.
However, existing localization based methods relying on intermediate
representations (\textit{i.e.}, density maps or pseudo boxes) serving as
learning targets are counter-intuitive and error-prone. In this paper, we
propose a purely point-based framework for joint crowd counting and individual
localization. For this framework, instead of merely reporting the absolute
counting error at image level, we propose a new metric, called density
Normalized Average Precision (nAP), to provide more comprehensive and more
precise performance evaluation. Moreover, we design an intuitive solution under
this framework, which is called Point to Point Network (P2PNet). P2PNet
discards superfluous steps and directly predicts a set of point proposals to
represent heads in an image, being consistent with the human annotation
results. By thorough analysis, we reveal the key step towards implementing such
a novel idea is to assign optimal learning targets for these proposals.
Therefore, we propose to conduct this crucial association in an one-to-one
matching manner using the Hungarian algorithm. The P2PNet not only
significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods on popular counting
benchmarks, but also achieves promising localization accuracy. The codes will
be available at: https://github.com/TencentYoutuResearch/CrowdCounting-P2PNet.]]></summary>

CFLOW-AD is faster and smaller by a factor of 10x than prior state-of-the-art

necessitates a visual representation that jointly pursues two confounding
goals, i.e., fine-grained discrimination for temporal localization and
sufficient visual invariance for action classification. We address this
challenge by enriching both the local and global contexts in the popular
two-stage temporal localization framework, where action proposals are first
generated followed by action classification and temporal boundary regression.
Our proposed model, dubbed ContextLoc, can be divided into three sub-networks:
L-Net, G-Net and P-Net. L-Net enriches the local context via fine-grained
modeling of snippet-level features, which is formulated as a
query-and-retrieval process. G-Net enriches the global context via higher-level
modeling of the video-level representation. In addition, we introduce a novel
context adaptation module to adapt the global context to different proposals.
P-Net further models the context-aware inter-proposal relations. We explore two
existing models to be the P-Net in our experiments. The efficacy of our
proposed method is validated by experimental results on the THUMOS14 (54.3\% at

especially in medical imaging and machine learning. Potential data quality
issues can be exacerbated when human-based workflows use limited views of the

network issues, accelerated acquisitions, motion artifacts, and imaging
protocol design can impede the interpretation of image collections. The medical
image processing community has developed a wide variety of tools for the

large-scale data mining of clinically acquired CT data. Using the widely

4% of image volumes with quality concerns out of 17,392 scans. To assess

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite the remarkable success of deep learning, optimal convolution
operation on point cloud remains indefinite due to its irregular data
structure. In this paper, we present Cubic Kernel Convolution (CKConv) that
learns to voxelize the features of local points by exploiting both continuous
and discrete convolutions. Our continuous convolution uniquely employs a 3D
cubic form of kernel weight representation that splits a feature into voxels in
embedding space. By consecutively applying discrete 3D convolutions on the
voxelized features in a spatial manner, preceding continuous convolution is
forced to learn spatial feature mapping, i.e., feature voxelization. In this
way, geometric information can be detailed by encoding with subdivided
features, and our 3D convolutions on these fixed structured data do not suffer
from discretization artifacts thanks to voxelization in embedding space.
Furthermore, we propose a spatial attention module, Local Set Attention (LSA),
to provide comprehensive structure awareness within the local point set and
hence produce representative features. By learning feature voxelization with
LSA, CKConv can extract enriched features for effective point cloud analysis.
We show that CKConv has great applicability to point cloud processing tasks
including object classification, object part segmentation, and scene semantic
segmentation with state-of-the-art results.]]></summary>

These methods use learned and handcrafted features, such as mel-frequency

of classifiers to estimate the type and amount of the content with acoustic
data, and geometric approaches with visual data to determine the capacity of
the container. Results on a newly distributed dataset show that audio alone is
a strong modality and methods achieves a weighted average F1-score up to 81%

with the guidance of language descriptions, has been a challenging problem in
the fields of computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). Currently,
a number of efforts have been made for this task, but their performances are
still distant away from generating realistic and text-conformed manipulated
images. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a memory-based Image Manipulation
Network (MIM-Net), where a set of memories learned from images is introduced to
synthesize the texture information with the guidance of the textual
description. We propose a two-stage network with an additional reconstruction
stage to learn the latent memories efficiently. To avoid the unnecessary
background changes, we propose a Target Localization Unit (TLU) to focus on the
manipulation of the region mentioned by the text. Moreover, to learn a robust
memory, we further propose a novel randomized memory training loss. Experiments
on the four popular datasets show the better performance of our method compared

made by machine learning systems. However, discriminative classifiers based on
deep neural networks are often criticized for producing overconfident
predictions that fail to reflect the true correctness likelihood of
classification accuracy. We argue that such an inability to model uncertainty
is mainly caused by the closed-world nature in softmax: a model trained by the
cross-entropy loss will be forced to classify input into one of $K$ pre-defined
categories with high probability. To address this problem, we for the first
time propose a novel $K$+1-way softmax formulation, which incorporates the
modeling of open-world uncertainty as the extra dimension. To unify the
learning of the original $K$-way classification task and the extra dimension
that models uncertainty, we propose a novel energy-based objective function,
and moreover, theoretically prove that optimizing such an objective essentially
forces the extra dimension to capture the marginal data distribution. Extensive
experiments show that our approach, Energy-based Open-World Softmax
(EOW-Softmax), is superior to existing state-of-the-art methods in improving
confidence calibration.]]></summary>

good, reliable data in machine learning. The most methods of outlier detection
leverage an auxiliary reconstruction task by assuming that outliers are more

always true, especially for auto-encoder (AE) based models. They may recover
certain outliers even outliers are not in the training data, because they do
not constrain the feature learning. Instead, we think outlier detection can be
done in the feature space by measuring the feature distance between outliers
and inliers. We then propose a framework, MCOD, using a memory module and a
contrastive learning module. The memory module constrains the consistency of
features, which represent the normal data. The contrastive learning module
learns more discriminating features, which boosts the distinction between
outliers and inliers. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detection transformers have recently shown promising object detection results
and attracted increasing attention. However, how to develop effective domain
adaptation techniques to improve its cross-domain performance remains
unexplored and unclear. In this paper, we delve into this topic and empirically
find that direct feature distribution alignment on the CNN backbone only brings
limited improvements, as it does not guarantee domain-invariant sequence
features in the transformer for prediction. To address this issue, we propose a
novel Sequence Feature Alignment (SFA) method that is specially designed for
the adaptation of detection transformers. Technically, SFA consists of a domain
query-based feature alignment (DQFA) module and a token-wise feature alignment
(TDA) module. In DQFA, a novel domain query is used to aggregate and align
global context from the token sequence of both domains. DQFA reduces the domain
discrepancy in global feature representations and object relations when
deploying in the transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. Meanwhile, TDA
aligns token features in the sequence from both domains, which reduces the
domain gaps in local and instance-level feature representations in the
transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. Besides, a novel bipartite
matching consistency loss is proposed to enhance the feature discriminability
for robust object detection. Experiments on three challenging benchmarks show
that SFA outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptive object detection methods.

many mission-critical systems for real time video analytics at the edge, such
as autonomous driving and video surveillance. A common performance requirement
in these mission-critical edge services is the near real-time latency of online
object detection on edge devices. However, even with well-trained DNN object
detectors, the online detection quality at edge may deteriorate for a number of
reasons, such as limited capacity to run DNN object detection models on
heterogeneous edge devices, and detection quality degradation due to random
frame dropping when the detection processing rate is significantly slower than
the incoming video frame rate. This paper addresses these problems by
exploiting multi-model multi-device detection parallelism for fast object
detection in edge systems with heterogeneous edge devices. First, we analyze
the performance bottleneck of running a well-trained DNN model at edge for real
time online object detection. We use the offline detection as a reference
model, and examine the root cause by analyzing the mismatch among the incoming
video streaming rate, video processing rate for object detection, and output
rate for real time detection visualization of video streaming. Second, we study
performance optimizations by exploiting multi-model detection parallelism. We
show that the model-parallel detection approach can effectively speed up the
FPS detection processing rate, minimizing the FPS disparity with the incoming
video frame rate on heterogeneous edge devices. We evaluate the proposed
approach using SSD300 and YOLOv3 on benchmark videos of different video stream
rates. The results show that exploiting multi-model detection parallelism can
speed up the online object detection processing rate and deliver near real-time
object detection performance for efficient video analytics at edge.]]></summary>

requirements in the industry. Existing color-guided depth map super-resolution
methods usually necessitate an extra branch to extract high-frequency detail
information from RGB image to guide the low-resolution depth map
reconstruction. However, because there are still some differences between the
two modalities, direct information transmission in the feature dimension or
edge map dimension cannot achieve satisfactory result, and may even trigger
texture copying in areas where the structures of the RGB-D pair are
inconsistent. Inspired by the multi-task learning, we propose a joint learning
network of depth map super-resolution (DSR) and monocular depth estimation
(MDE) without introducing additional supervision labels. For the interaction of
two subnetworks, we adopt a differentiated guidance strategy and design two
bridges correspondingly. One is the high-frequency attention bridge (HABdg)
designed for the feature encoding process, which learns the high-frequency
information of the MDE task to guide the DSR task. The other is the content
guidance bridge (CGBdg) designed for the depth map reconstruction process,
which provides the content guidance learned from DSR task for MDE task. The
entire network architecture is highly portable and can provide a paradigm for
associating the DSR and MDE tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the classic setting of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), the labeled
source data are available in the training phase. However, in many real-world
scenarios, owing to some reasons such as privacy protection and information
security, the source data is inaccessible, and only a model trained on the
source domain is available. This paper proposes a novel deep clustering method
for this challenging task. Aiming at the dynamical clustering at feature-level,
we introduce extra constraints hidden in the geometric structure between data
to assist the process. Concretely, we propose a geometry-based constraint,
named semantic consistency on the nearest neighborhood (SCNNH), and use it to
encourage robust clustering. To reach this goal, we construct the nearest
neighborhood for every target data and take it as the fundamental clustering
unit by building our objective on the geometry. Also, we develop a more
SCNNH-compliant structure with an additional semantic credibility constraint,
named semantic hyper-nearest neighborhood (SHNNH). After that, we extend our
method to this new geometry. Extensive experiments on three challenging UDA
datasets indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. The
proposed method has significant improvement on all datasets (as we adopt SHNNH,
the average accuracy increases by over 3.0\% on the large-scaled dataset). Code

detection. The majority of existing network structure design is based on the
subjective experience of scholars and the process of feature fusion does not
consider the relationship between the fused features and highest-level
features. In this paper, we focus on the feature relationship and propose a
novel global attention unit, which we term the "perception- and-regulation"
(PR) block, that adaptively regulates the feature fusion process by explicitly
modeling interdependencies between features. The perception part uses the
structure of fully-connected layers in classification networks to learn the
size and shape of objects. The regulation part selectively strengthens and
weakens the features to be fused. An imitating eye observation module (IEO) is
further employed for improving the global perception ability of the network.
The imitation of foveal vision and peripheral vision enables IEO to scrutinize
highly detailed objects and to organize the broad spatial scene to better
segment objects. Sufficient experiments conducted on SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method performs favorably against 22 state-of-the-art
methods.]]></summary>

disrupts activations of early convolutional layers in deep learning models. Our
hypothesis is that perturbations produced in the wavelet space disrupt early
convolutional layers more effectively than perturbations performed in the time
domain. The main challenge in adversarial attacks is to preserve low frequency
image content while minimally changing the most meaningful high frequency
content. To address this, we formulate an optimization problem using time-scale
(wavelet) representations as a dual space in three steps. First, we project
original images into orthonormal sub-spaces for low and high scales via wavelet
coefficients. Second, we perturb wavelet coefficients for high scale projection
using a generator network. Third, we generate new adversarial images by
projecting back the original coefficients from the low scale and the perturbed
coefficients from the high scale sub-space. We provide a theoretical framework
that guarantees a dual mapping from time and time-scale domain representations.
We compare our results with state-of-the-art black-box attacks from
generative-based and gradient-based models. We also verify efficacy against
multiple defense methods such as JPEG compression, Guided Denoiser and
Comdefend. Our results show that wavelet-based perturbations consistently
outperform time-based attacks thus providing new insights into vulnerabilities
of deep learning models and could potentially lead to robust architectures or
new defense and attack mechanisms by leveraging time-scale representations.]]></summary>

than its outdoor counterpart in at least the following two aspects: (i) the
depth range of indoor sequences varies a lot across different frames, making it
difficult for the depth network to induce consistent depth cues, whereas the
maximum distance in outdoor scenes mostly stays the same as the camera usually
sees the sky; (ii) the indoor sequences contain much more rotational motions,
which cause difficulties for the pose network, while the motions of outdoor
sequences are pre-dominantly translational, especially for driving datasets
such as KITTI. In this paper, special considerations are given to those
challenges and a set of good practices are consolidated for improving the
performance of self-supervised monocular depth estimation in indoor
environments. The proposed method mainly consists of two novel modules, \ie, a
depth factorization module and a residual pose estimation module, each of which
is designed to respectively tackle the aforementioned challenges. The
effectiveness of each module is shown through a carefully conducted ablation
study and the demonstration of the state-of-the-art performance on two indoor
datasets, \ie, EuRoC and NYUv2.]]></summary>

Motion-Aware Mask Propagation (MAMP) for semi-supervised video object
segmentation. During training, MAMP leverages the frame reconstruction task to
train the model without the need for annotations. During inference, MAMP
extracts high-resolution features from each frame to build a memory bank from
the features as well as the predicted masks of selected past frames. MAMP then
propagates the masks from the memory bank to subsequent frames according to our
motion-aware spatio-temporal matching module, also proposed in this paper.
Evaluation on DAVIS-2017 and YouTube-VOS datasets show that MAMP achieves
state-of-the-art performance with stronger generalization ability compared to
existing self-supervised methods, i.e. 4.9\% higher mean
$\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ on DAVIS-2017 and 4.85\% higher mean
$\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ on the unseen categories of YouTube-VOS than the
nearest competitor. Moreover, MAMP performs on par with many supervised video

underspecified, for example "Can you bring me the wireless mouse?" When viewing
mice on the shelf, the number of buttons or presence of a wire may not be
visible from certain angles or positions. Flat images of candidate mice may not
provide the discriminative information needed for "wireless". The world, and
objects in it, are not flat images but complex 3D shapes. If a human requests
an object based on any of its basic properties, such as color, shape, or
texture, robots should perform the necessary exploration to accomplish the
task. In particular, while substantial effort and progress has been made on
understanding explicitly visual attributes like color and category,
comparatively little progress has been made on understanding language about
shapes and contours. In this work, we introduce a novel reasoning task that
targets both visual and non-visual language about 3D objects. Our new
benchmark, ShapeNet Annotated with Referring Expressions (SNARE), requires a
model to choose which of two objects is being referenced by a natural language
description. We introduce several CLIP-based models for distinguishing objects
and demonstrate that while recent advances in jointly modeling vision and
language are useful for robotic language understanding, it is still the case
that these models are weaker at understanding the 3D nature of objects --
properties which play a key role in manipulation. In particular, we find that
adding view estimation to language grounding models improves accuracy on both
SNARE and when identifying objects referred to in language on a robot platform.]]></summary>

submission to 2021 HACS Temporal Action Localization Challenge on both
Supervised Learning Track and Weakly-Supervised Learning Track. Temporal Action
Localization (TAL) requires to not only precisely locate the temporal
boundaries of action instances, but also accurately classify the untrimmed
videos into specific categories. However, Weakly-Supervised TAL indicates
locating the action instances using only video-level class labels. In this
paper, to train a supervised temporal action localizer, we adopt Temporal
Context Aggregation Network (TCANet) to generate high-quality action proposals
through ``local and global" temporal context aggregation and complementary as
well as progressive boundary refinement. As for the WSTAL, a novel framework is
proposed to handle the poor quality of CAS generated by simple classification
network, which can only focus on local discriminative parts, rather than locate
the entire interval of target actions. Further inspired by the transfer
learning method, we also adopt an additional module to transfer the knowledge
from trimmed videos (HACS Clips dataset) to untrimmed videos (HACS Segments
dataset), aiming at promoting the classification performance on untrimmed
videos. Finally, we employ a boundary regression module embedded with
Outer-Inner-Contrastive (OIC) loss to automatically predict the boundaries
based on the enhanced CAS. Our proposed scheme achieves 39.91 and 29.78 average
mAP on the challenge testing set of supervised and weakly-supervised temporal
action localization track respectively.]]></summary>

tremendous improvements recently by using deep learning to combat complex
real-world variations, but a majority of methods build models on the per-object
level, failing to scale to multiple objects simultaneously. In this paper, we
present a novel approach for scalable 6D pose estimation, by self-supervised
learning on synthetic data of multiple objects using a single autoencoder. To
handle multiple objects and generalize to unseen objects, we disentangle the
latent object shape and pose representations, so that the latent shape space
models shape similarities, and the latent pose code is used for rotation
retrieval by comparison with canonical rotations. To encourage shape space
construction, we apply contrastive metric learning and enable the processing of
unseen objects by referring to similar training objects. The different
symmetries across objects induce inconsistent latent pose spaces, which we
capture with a conditioned block producing shape-dependent pose codebooks by
re-entangling shape and pose representations. We test our method on two
multi-object benchmarks with real data, T-LESS and NOCS REAL275, and show it
outperforms existing RGB-based methods in terms of pose estimation accuracy and
generalization.]]></summary>

content quality of a summary is that it should estimate how much information
that summary has in common with a reference. Traditional text overlap based
metrics such as ROUGE fail to achieve this because they are limited to matching
tokens, either lexically or via embeddings. In this work, we propose a metric
to evaluate the content quality of a summary using question-answering (QA).
QA-based methods directly measure a summary's information overlap with a
reference, making them fundamentally different than text overlap metrics. We
demonstrate the experimental benefits of QA-based metrics through an analysis
of our proposed metric, QAEval. QAEval out-performs current state-of-the-art
metrics on most evaluations using benchmark datasets, while being competitive
on others due to limitations of state-of-the-art models. Through a careful
analysis of each component of QAEval, we identify its performance bottlenecks
and estimate that its potential upper-bound performance surpasses all other
automatic metrics, approaching that of the gold-standard Pyramid Method.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Advanced tensor decomposition, such as Tensor train (TT) and Tensor ring
(TR), has been widely studied for deep neural network (DNN) model compression,
especially for recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, compressing
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using TT/TR always suffers significant
accuracy loss. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for tensor
decomposition-based model compression using Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM). By formulating TT decomposition-based model compression to
an optimization problem with constraints on tensor ranks, we leverage ADMM
technique to systemically solve this optimization problem in an iterative way.
During this procedure, the entire DNN model is trained in the original
structure instead of TT format, but gradually enjoys the desired low tensor
rank characteristics. We then decompose this uncompressed model to TT format
and fine-tune it to finally obtain a high-accuracy TT-format DNN model. Our
framework is very general, and it works for both CNNs and RNNs, and can be
easily modified to fit other tensor decomposition approaches. We evaluate our
proposed framework on different DNN models for image classification and video
recognition tasks. Experimental results show that our ADMM-based TT-format
models demonstrate very high compression performance with high accuracy.
Notably, on CIFAR-100, with 2.3X and 2.4X compression ratios, our models have
1.96% and 2.21% higher top-1 accuracy than the original ResNet-20 and
ResNet-32, respectively. For compressing ResNet-18 on ImageNet, our model
achieves 2.47X FLOPs reduction without accuracy loss.]]></summary>

that focuses on identifying the description of the cause behind an emotion
expression from a text passage (e.g., in the sentence "I am happy that I passed

We compare the performance of a conditional random field (CRF) model (trained
monolingually on German and cross-lingually via projection) with a multilingual
XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R) model. Our results show that training with the German

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weakly supervised temporal action localization (WS-TAL) is a challenging task
that aims to localize action instances in the given video with video-level
categorical supervision. Both appearance and motion features are used in
previous works, while they do not utilize them in a proper way but apply simple
concatenation or score-level fusion. In this work, we argue that the features
extracted from the pretrained extractor, e.g., I3D, are not the
WS-TALtask-specific features, thus the feature re-calibration is needed for
reducing the task-irrelevant information redundancy. Therefore, we propose a
cross-modal consensus network (CO2-Net) to tackle this problem. In CO2-Net, we
mainly introduce two identical proposed cross-modal consensus modules (CCM)
that design a cross-modal attention mechanism to filter out the task-irrelevant
information redundancy using the global information from the main modality and
the cross-modal local information of the auxiliary modality. Moreover, we treat
the attention weights derived from each CCMas the pseudo targets of the
attention weights derived from another CCM to maintain the consistency between
the predictions derived from two CCMs, forming a mutual learning manner.
Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two common used temporal action
localization datasets, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.2, to verify our method and
achieve the state-of-the-art results. The experimental results show that our
proposed cross-modal consensus module can produce more representative features
for temporal action localization.]]></summary>

explain how its constituting steps are implemented in practice, depending on

networks, with a focus on the way they are interpreted in this context. We

intensification of agriculture and addressing global food security. A dataset
like ImageNet that revolutionized computer vision applications can accelerate
development of novel crop mapping techniques. Currently, the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) annually releases the Cropland Data Layer
(CDL) which contains crop labels at 30m resolution for the entire United States
of America. While CDL is state of the art and is widely used for a number of
agricultural applications, it has a number of limitations (e.g., pixelated
errors, labels carried over from previous errors and absence of input imagery
along with class labels). In this work, we create a new semantic segmentation
benchmark dataset, which we call CalCROP21, for the diverse crops in the
Central Valley region of California at 10m spatial resolution using a Google
Earth Engine based robust image processing pipeline and a novel attention based
spatio-temporal semantic segmentation algorithm STATT. STATT uses re-sampled
(interpolated) CDL labels for training, but is able to generate a better
prediction than CDL by leveraging spatial and temporal patterns in Sentinel2
multi-spectral image series to effectively capture phenologic differences
amongst crops and uses attention to reduce the impact of clouds and other
atmospheric disturbances. We also present a comprehensive evaluation to show
that STATT has significantly better results when compared to the resampled CDL
labels. We have released the dataset and the processing pipeline code for
generating the benchmark dataset.]]></summary>

people who suffer from mental disorders to share moments of hardship, and
receive emotional and informational support. In this work, we analyze how
discussions in Reddit communities related to mental disorders can help improve
the health conditions of their users. Using the emotional tone of users'
writing as a proxy for emotional state, we uncover relationships between user
interactions and state changes. First, we observe that authors of negative
posts often write rosier comments after engaging in discussions, indicating
that users' emotional state can improve due to social support. Second, we build
models based on SOTA text embedding techniques and RNNs to predict shifts in
emotional tone. This differs from most of related work, which focuses primarily
on detecting mental disorders from user activity. We demonstrate the
feasibility of accurately predicting the users' reactions to the interactions
experienced in these platforms, and present some examples which illustrate that
the models are correctly capturing the effects of comments on the author's
emotional tone. Our models hold promising implications for interventions to

weight of a container and the amount of its content when the container is

problem challenging. In this paper, we present an open benchmarking framework
and an in-depth comparative analysis of recent methods that estimate the

These methods use learned and handcrafted features, such as mel-frequency
cepstrum coefficients, zero-crossing rate, spectrograms, with different types
of classifiers to estimate the type and amount of the content with acoustic
data, and geometric approaches with visual data to determine the capacity of
the container. Results on a newly distributed dataset show that audio alone is
a strong modality and methods achieves a weighted average F1-score up to 81%
and 97% for content type and level classification, respectively. Estimating the
container capacity with vision-only approaches and filling mass with
multi-modal, multi-stage algorithms reaches up to 65% weighted average capacity

represent characters and edges correspond to interactions between them. A
number of narrative-related problems can be addressed automatically through the
analysis of character networks, such as summarization, classification, or role
detection. Character networks are particularly relevant when considering works
of fictions (e.g. novels, plays, movies, TV series), as their exploitation
allows developing information retrieval and recommendation systems. However,
works of fiction possess specific properties making these tasks harder. This
survey aims at presenting and organizing the scientific literature related to
the extraction of character networks from works of fiction, as well as their
analysis. We first describe the extraction process in a generic way, and
explain how its constituting steps are implemented in practice, depending on
the medium of the narrative, the goal of the network analysis, and other
factors. We then review the descriptive tools used to characterize character
networks, with a focus on the way they are interpreted in this context. We
illustrate the relevance of character networks by also providing a review of
applications derived from their analysis. Finally, we identify the limitations
of the existing approaches, and the most promising perspectives.]]></summary>

models which learn to associate linguistic units with emotions. While this
often leads to good predictive performance, it does only help to a limited
degree to understand how emotions are communicated in various domains. The
emotion component process model (CPM) by Scherer (2005) is an interesting
approach to explain emotion communication. It states that emotions are a
coordinated process of various subcomponents, in reaction to an event, namely
the subjective feeling, the cognitive appraisal, the expression, a
physiological bodily reaction, and a motivational action tendency. We
hypothesize that these components are associated with linguistic realizations:
an emotion can be expressed by describing a physiological bodily reaction ("he
was trembling"), or the expression ("she smiled"), etc. We annotate existing
literature and Twitter emotion corpora with emotion component classes and find
that emotions on Twitter are predominantly expressed by event descriptions or
subjective reports of the feeling, while in literature, authors prefer to
describe what characters do, and leave the interpretation to the reader. We
further include the CPM in a multitask learning model and find that this
supports the emotion categorization. The annotated corpora are available at

gradually increasing over the years. With the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers
have turned to more nontraditional sources of clinical data to characterize the
disease in near real-time, study the societal implications of interventions, as
well as the sequelae that recovered COVID-19 cases present (Long-COVID).
However, manually curated social media datasets are difficult to come by due to
the expensive costs of manual annotation and the efforts needed to identify the
correct texts. When datasets are available, they are usually very small and
their annotations do not generalize well over time or to larger sets of
documents. As part of the 2021 Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon, we
release our dataset of over 120 million automatically annotated tweets for
biomedical research purposes. Incorporating best practices, we identify tweets
with potentially high clinical relevance. We evaluated our work by comparing
several SpaCy-based annotation frameworks against a manually annotated
gold-standard dataset. Selecting the best method to use for automatic
annotation, we then annotated 120 million tweets and released them publicly for
future downstream usage within the biomedical domain.]]></summary>

problems of sequential recommendation. Existing methods in this field are
widely distributed from conventional methods to deep learning methods. However,
most of them only model users' interests within their own sequences and ignore
the dynamic collaborative signals among different user sequences, making it
insufficient to explore users' preferences. We take inspiration from dynamic
graph neural networks to cope with this challenge, modeling the user sequence
and dynamic collaborative signals into one framework. We propose a new method
named Dynamic Graph Neural Network for Sequential Recommendation (DGSR), which
connects different user sequences through a dynamic graph structure, exploring
the interactive behavior of users and items with time and order information.
Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Graph Recommendation Network to extract user's
preferences from the dynamic graph. Consequently, the next-item prediction task
in sequential recommendation is converted into a link prediction between the
user node and the item node in a dynamic graph. Extensive experiments on three
public benchmarks show that DGSR outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.
Further studies demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of modeling user
sequences through a dynamic graph.]]></summary>

recommender system results. Deep matrix factorization and their related
collaborative neural networks are the state-of-art in the field; nevertheless,
both models lack the necessary stochasticity to create the robust, continuous,
and structured latent spaces that variational autoencoders exhibit. On the
other hand, data augmentation through variational autoencoder does not provide
accurate results in the collaborative filtering field due to the high sparsity
of recommender systems. Our proposed models apply the variational concept to
inject stochasticity in the latent space of the deep architecture, introducing
the variational technique in the neural collaborative filtering field. This
method does not depend on the particular model used to generate the latent
representation. In this way, this approach can be applied as a plugin to any
current and future specific models. The proposed models have been tested using
four representative open datasets, three different quality measures, and
state-of-art baselines. The results show the superiority of the proposed
approach in scenarios where the variational enrichment exceeds the injected
noise effect. Additionally, a framework is provided to enable the
reproducibility of the conducted experiments.]]></summary>

Natural Language Processing. Using a grammar that can be interpreted as tensor
contractions, each word is represented as a quantum state that serves as input
to the quantum circuit. We here introduce a quantum measurement to contract the
representations of words, resulting in the representation of larger text

that contains all the possible answers in equal quantum superposition, and
allows for the building of an oracle that can detect a correct answer, being
agnostic to the specific question. Furthermore, we show that our construction

impairments, holding a paintbrush to create a work is a very difficult task.
People in this special group are eager to pick up the paintbrush, like Leonardo
da Vinci, to create and make full use of their own talents. Therefore, to
maximally bridge this gap, we propose a painting navigation system to assist
blind people in painting and artistic creation. The proposed system is composed
of cognitive system and guidance system. The system adopts drawing board
positioning based on QR code, brush navigation based on target detection and
bush real-time positioning. Meanwhile, this paper uses human-computer
interaction on the basis of voice and a simple but efficient position
information coding rule. In addition, we design a criterion to efficiently
judge whether the brush reaches the target or not. According to the
experimental results, the thermal curves extracted from the faces of testers
show that it is relatively well accepted by blindfolded and even blind testers.
With the prompt frequency of 1s, the painting navigation system performs best
with the completion degree of 89% with SD of 8.37% and overflow degree of 347%
with SD of 162.14%. Meanwhile, the excellent and good types of brush tip
trajectory account for 74%, and the relative movement distance is 4.21 with SD
of 2.51. This work demonstrates that it is practicable for the blind people to
feel the world through the brush in their hands. In the future, we plan to
deploy Angle's Eyes on the phone to make it more portable. The demo video of
the proposed painting navigation system is available at:

It also utilizes the application logs created by the decoder to identify
correct parameter values. Evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed
method on more than 55K videos with diverse provenance shows that it can
generate valid headers on average in 11.3 decoding trials per video. This

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Matching images and sentences demands a fine understanding of both
modalities. In this paper, we propose a new system to discriminatively embed
the image and text to a shared visual-textual space. In this field, most
existing works apply the ranking loss to pull the positive image / text pairs
close and push the negative pairs apart from each other. However, directly
deploying the ranking loss is hard for network learning, since it starts from
the two heterogeneous features to build inter-modal relationship. To address
this problem, we propose the instance loss which explicitly considers the
intra-modal data distribution. It is based on an unsupervised assumption that
each image / text group can be viewed as a class. So the network can learn the
fine granularity from every image/text group. The experiment shows that the
instance loss offers better weight initialization for the ranking loss, so that
more discriminative embeddings can be learned. Besides, existing works usually
apply the off-the-shelf features, i.e., word2vec and fixed visual feature. So
in a minor contribution, this paper constructs an end-to-end dual-path
convolutional network to learn the image and text representations. End-to-end
learning allows the system to directly learn from the data and fully utilize
the supervision. On two generic retrieval datasets (Flickr30k and MSCOCO),
experiments demonstrate that our method yields competitive accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, in language based person retrieval, we
improve the state of the art by a large margin. The code has been made publicly

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The goal of dialogue state tracking (DST) is to predict the current dialogue
state given all previous dialogue contexts. Existing approaches generally
predict the dialogue state at every turn from scratch. However, the
overwhelming majority of the slots in each turn should simply inherit the slot
values from the previous turn. Therefore, the mechanism of treating slots
equally in each turn not only is inefficient but also may lead to additional
errors because of the redundant slot value generation. To address this problem,
we devise the two-stage DSS-DST which consists of the Dual Slot Selector based
on the current turn dialogue, and the Slot Value Generator based on the
dialogue history. The Dual Slot Selector determines each slot whether to update
slot value or to inherit the slot value from the previous turn from two
aspects: (1) if there is a strong relationship between it and the current turn
dialogue utterances; (2) if a slot value with high reliability can be obtained
for it through the current turn dialogue. The slots selected to be updated are
permitted to enter the Slot Value Generator to update values by a hybrid
method, while the other slots directly inherit the values from the previous
turn. Empirical results show that our method achieves 56.93%, 60.73%, and
58.04% joint accuracy on MultiWOZ 2.0, MultiWOZ 2.1, and MultiWOZ 2.2 datasets

counting, which is a critical task attracting widespread attention due to its
various industrial applications. Despite such progress, trained data-dependent
models usually can not generalize well to unseen scenarios because of the
inherent domain shift. To facilitate this issue, this paper proposes a novel
adversarial scoring network (ASNet) to gradually bridge the gap across domains
from coarse to fine granularity. In specific, at the coarse-grained stage, we
design a dual-discriminator strategy to adapt source domain to be close to the
targets from the perspectives of both global and local feature space via
adversarial learning. The distributions between two domains can thus be aligned
roughly. At the fine-grained stage, we explore the transferability of source
characteristics by scoring how similar the source samples are to target ones
from multiple levels based on generative probability derived from coarse stage.
Guided by these hierarchical scores, the transferable source features are
properly selected to enhance the knowledge transfer during the adaptation
process. With the coarse-to-fine design, the generalization bottleneck induced
from the domain discrepancy can be effectively alleviated. Three sets of
migration experiments show that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art
counting performance compared with major unsupervised methods.]]></summary>

unprecedented intensity. Besides the fear of getting infected, the outbreak of
COVID-19 also created significant disruptions in people's daily life and thus
evoked intensive psychological responses indirect to COVID-19 infections. Here,
we construct an expressed fear database using 16 million social media posts
generated by 536 thousand users between January 1st, 2019 and August 31st, 2020
in China. We employ deep learning techniques to detect the fear emotion within
each post and apply topic models to extract the central fear topics. Based on
this database, we find that sleep disorders ("nightmare" and "insomnia") take
up the largest share of fear-labeled posts in the pre-pandemic period (January
2019-December 2019), and significantly increase during the COVID-19. We
identify health and work-related concerns are the two major sources of fear
induced by the COVID-19. We also detect gender differences, with females
generating more posts containing the daily-life fear sources during the
COVID-19 period. This research adopts a data-driven approach to trace back
public emotion, which can be used to complement traditional surveys to achieve
real-time emotion monitoring to discern societal concerns and support policy
decision-making.]]></summary>

underspecified, for example "Can you bring me the wireless mouse?" When viewing
mice on the shelf, the number of buttons or presence of a wire may not be
visible from certain angles or positions. Flat images of candidate mice may not
provide the discriminative information needed for "wireless". The world, and
objects in it, are not flat images but complex 3D shapes. If a human requests
an object based on any of its basic properties, such as color, shape, or
texture, robots should perform the necessary exploration to accomplish the
task. In particular, while substantial effort and progress has been made on
understanding explicitly visual attributes like color and category,
comparatively little progress has been made on understanding language about
shapes and contours. In this work, we introduce a novel reasoning task that
targets both visual and non-visual language about 3D objects. Our new
benchmark, ShapeNet Annotated with Referring Expressions (SNARE), requires a
model to choose which of two objects is being referenced by a natural language
description. We introduce several CLIP-based models for distinguishing objects
and demonstrate that while recent advances in jointly modeling vision and
language are useful for robotic language understanding, it is still the case
that these models are weaker at understanding the 3D nature of objects --
properties which play a key role in manipulation. In particular, we find that
adding view estimation to language grounding models improves accuracy on both
SNARE and when identifying objects referred to in language on a robot platform.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus is a controlled vocabulary
widely used in biomedical knowledge systems, particularly for semantic indexing
of scientific literature. As the MeSH hierarchy evolves through annual version
updates, some new descriptors are introduced that were not previously
available. This paper explores the conceptual provenance of these new
descriptors. In particular, we investigate whether such new descriptors have
been previously covered by older descriptors and what is their current relation
to them. To this end, we propose a framework to categorize new descriptors
based on their current relation to older descriptors. Based on the proposed
classification scheme, we quantify, analyse and present the different types of
new descriptors introduced in MeSH during the last fifteen years. The results
show that only about 25% of new MeSH descriptors correspond to new emerging
concepts, whereas the rest were previously covered by one or more existing
descriptors, either implicitly or explicitly. Most of them were covered by a
single existing descriptor and they usually end up as descendants of it in the
current hierarchy, gradually leading towards a more fine-grained MeSH
vocabulary. These insights about the dynamics of the thesaurus are useful for
the retrospective study of scientific articles annotated with MeSH, but could
also be used to inform the policy of updating the thesaurus in the future.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Though the pre-trained contextualized language model (PrLM) has made a
significant impact on NLP, training PrLMs in languages other than English can
be impractical for two reasons: other languages often lack corpora sufficient
for training powerful PrLMs, and because of the commonalities among human
languages, computationally expensive PrLM training for different languages is
somewhat redundant. In this work, building upon the recent works connecting
cross-lingual model transferring and neural machine translation, we thus
propose a novel cross-lingual model transferring framework for PrLMs: TreLM. To
handle the symbol order and sequence length differences between languages, we
propose an intermediate ``TRILayer" structure that learns from these
differences and creates a better transfer in our primary translation direction,
as well as a new cross-lingual language modeling objective for transfer
training. Additionally, we showcase an embedding aligning that adversarially
adapts a PrLM's non-contextualized embedding space and the TRILayer structure
to learn a text transformation network across languages, which addresses the
vocabulary difference between languages. Experiments on both language
understanding and structure parsing tasks show the proposed framework
significantly outperforms language models trained from scratch with limited
data in both performance and efficiency. Moreover, despite an insignificant
performance loss compared to pre-training from scratch in resource-rich
scenarios, our cross-lingual model transferring framework is significantly more
economical.]]></summary>

bias in VQA that comes from two aspects, i.e., distribution bias and shortcut
bias. We further propose a new de-bias framework, Greedy Gradient Ensemble
(GGE), which combines multiple biased models for unbiased base model learning.
With the greedy strategy, GGE forces the biased models to over-fit the biased
data distribution in priority, thus makes the base model pay more attention to
examples that are hard to solve by biased models. The experiments demonstrate
that our method makes better use of visual information and achieves

years. Addressing the issue requires a combination of content moderation by

directed at different target groups using a completely different vocabulary.
Further the authors of the hate speech are incentivized to disguise their

develop a comprehensive data set for training and evaluating hate speech
detection models because the examples that represent one hate speech domain do
not typically represent others, even within the same language or culture. We
propose an unsupervised domain adaptation approach to augment labeled data for
hate speech detection. We evaluate the approach with three different models

vision and graphics. The required smoothing properties can be different or even
contradictive among different tasks. Nevertheless, the inherent smoothing
nature of one smoothing operator is usually fixed and thus cannot meet the
various requirements of different applications. In this paper, we first
introduce the truncated Huber penalty function which shows strong flexibility
under different parameter settings. A generalized framework is then proposed
with the introduced truncated Huber penalty function. When combined with its
strong flexibility, our framework is able to achieve diverse smoothing natures
where contradictive smoothing behaviors can even be achieved. It can also yield
the smoothing behavior that can seldom be achieved by previous methods, and
superior performance is thus achieved in challenging cases. These together
enable our framework capable of a range of applications and able to outperform
the state-of-the-art approaches in several tasks, such as image detail
enhancement, clip-art compression artifacts removal, guided depth map
restoration, image texture removal, etc. In addition, an efficient numerical
solution is provided and its convergence is theoretically guaranteed even the
optimization framework is non-convex and non-smooth. A simple yet effective
approach is further proposed to reduce the computational cost of our method

restrictions on data availability. To still obtain viable models, continual
learning aims to train in sequential order, as and when data is available. The
main challenge that continual learning methods face is to prevent catastrophic
forgetting, i.e., a decrease in performance on the data encountered earlier.
This issue makes continuous training of segmentation models for medical
applications extremely difficult. Yet, often, data from at least two different
domains is available which we can exploit to train the model in a way that it
disregards domain-specific information. We propose an architecture that
leverages the simultaneous availability of two or more datasets to learn a
disentanglement between the content and domain in an adversarial fashion. The
domain-invariant content representation then lays the base for continual
semantic segmentation. Our approach takes inspiration from domain adaptation
and combines it with continual learning for hippocampal segmentation in brain
MRI. We showcase that our method reduces catastrophic forgetting and

environments: an abrupt environment where changes occur instantaneously and a
gradual environment where changes occur progressively. We demonstrate that
ADR-bandit has nearly optimal performance when the abrupt or global changes
occur in a coordinated manner that we call global changes. We demonstrate that
forced exploration is unnecessary when we restrict the interest to the global
changes. Unlike the existing nonstationary bandit algorithms, ADR-bandit has
optimal performance in stationary environments as well as nonstationary
environments with global changes. Our experiments show that the proposed
algorithms outperform the existing approaches in synthetic and real-world
environments.]]></summary>

(https://www.ethnologue.com/guides/ethnologue200), with 230 million native

language processing (NLP) community. With three decades of research, Bangla NLP
(BNLP) is still lagging behind mainly due to the scarcity of resources and the
challenges that come with it. There is sparse work in different areas of BNLP;
however, a thorough survey reporting previous work and recent advances is yet
to be done. In this study, we first provide a review of Bangla NLP tasks,
resources, and tools available to the research community; we benchmark datasets
collected from various platforms for nine NLP tasks using current
state-of-the-art algorithms (i.e., transformer-based models). We provide
comparative results for the studied NLP tasks by comparing monolingual vs.
multilingual models of varying sizes. We report our results using both
individual and consolidated datasets and provide data splits for future
research. We reviewed a total of 108 papers and conducted 175 sets of
experiments. Our results show promising performance using transformer-based
models while highlighting the trade-off with computational costs. We hope that
such a comprehensive survey will motivate the community to build on and further
advance the research on Bangla NLP.]]></summary>

deep learning-based image upsampling applications. State-of-the-art deep
learning solutions for image upsampling are currently trained using either
resize or sub-pixel convolution to learn kernels that generate high fidelity
images with minimal artifacts. However, performing inference with these learned
convolution kernels requires memory-intensive feature map transformations that
dominate time and energy costs in real-time applications. To alleviate this
pressure on memory bandwidth, we confine the use of resize or sub-pixel
convolution to training in the cloud by transforming learned convolution
kernels to deconvolution kernels before deploying them for inference as a
functionally equivalent deconvolution. These kernel transformations, intended
as a one-time cost when shifting from training to inference, enable a systems
designer to use each algorithm in their optimal context by preserving the image
fidelity learned when training in the cloud while minimizing data transfer
penalties during inference at the edge. We also explore existing variants of
deconvolution inference algorithms and introduce a novel variant for
consideration. We analyze and compare the inference properties of
convolution-based upsampling algorithms using a quantitative model of incurred
time and energy costs and show that using deconvolution for inference at the
edge improves both system latency and energy efficiency when compared to their
sub-pixel or resize convolution counterparts.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most recent graph clustering methods have resorted to Graph Auto-Encoders
(GAEs) to perform joint clustering and embedding learning. However, two
critical issues have been overlooked. First, the accumulative error, inflicted
by learning with noisy clustering assignments, degrades the effectiveness and
robustness of the clustering model. This problem is called Feature Randomness.
Second, reconstructing the adjacency matrix sets the model to learn irrelevant
similarities for the clustering task. This problem is called Feature Drift.
Interestingly, the theoretical relation between the aforementioned problems has
not yet been investigated. We study these issues from two aspects: (1) there is
a trade-off between Feature Randomness and Feature Drift when clustering and
reconstruction are performed at the same level, and (2) the problem of Feature
Drift is more pronounced for GAE models, compared with vanilla auto-encoder
models, due to the graph convolutional operation and the graph decoding design.
Motivated by these findings, we reformulate the GAE-based clustering
methodology. Our solution is two-fold. First, we propose a sampling operator
$\Xi$ that triggers a protection mechanism against the noisy clustering
assignments. Second, we propose an operator $\Upsilon$ that triggers a
correction mechanism against Feature Drift by gradually transforming the
reconstructed graph into a clustering-oriented one. As principal advantages,
our solution grants a considerable improvement in clustering effectiveness and
robustness and can be easily tailored to existing GAE models.]]></summary>

(DRL) via combining deep learning (DL) with reinforcement learning (RL), which
has noticed that the distribution of the acquired data would change during the
training process. DQN found this property might cause instability for training,
so it proposed effective methods to handle the downside of the property.
Instead of focusing on the unfavourable aspects, we find it critical for RL to
ease the gap between the estimated data distribution and the ground truth data
distribution while supervised learning (SL) fails to do so. From this new
perspective, we extend the basic paradigm of RL called the Generalized Policy
Iteration (GPI) into a more generalized version, which is called the
Generalized Data Distribution Iteration (GDI). We see massive RL algorithms and
techniques can be unified into the GDI paradigm, which can be considered as one
of the special cases of GDI. We provide theoretical proof of why GDI is better
than GPI and how it works. Several practical algorithms based on GDI have been
proposed to verify the effectiveness and extensiveness of it. Empirical
experiments prove our state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on Arcade Learning
Environment (ALE), wherein our algorithm has achieved 9620.98% mean human
normalized score (HNS), 1146.39% median HNS and 22 human world record

identification of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) due to its ability to obtain
high resolution information about the genes and mechanisms that are causing
resistance and driving pathogen mobility. By contrast, traditional phenotypic
(antibiogram) testing cannot easily elucidate such information. Yet development
of AMR prediction tools from genotype-phenotype data can be biased, since
sampling is non-randomized. Sample provenience, period of collection, and
species representation can confound the association of genetic traits with AMR.
Thus, prediction models can perform poorly on new data with sampling
distribution shifts. In this work -- under an explicit set of causal
assumptions -- we evaluate the effectiveness of propensity-based rebalancing
and confounding adjustment on AMR prediction using genotype-phenotype AMR data
from the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC). We select bacterial
genotypes (encoded as k-mer signatures, i.e. DNA fragments of length k),
country, year, species, and AMR phenotypes for the tetracycline drug class,
preparing test data with recent genomes coming from a single country. We test
boosted logistic regression (BLR) and random forests (RF) with/without
bias-handling. On 10,936 instances, we find evidence of species, location and
year imbalance with respect to the AMR phenotype. The crude versus
bias-adjusted change in effect of genetic signatures on AMR varies but only
moderately (selecting the top 20,000 out of 40+ million k-mers). The area under
the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of the RF (0.95) is comparable to
that of BLR (0.94) on both out-of-bag samples from bootstrap and the external
test (n=1,085), where AUROCs do not decrease. We observe a 1%-5% gain in AUROC
with bias-handling compared to the sole use of genetic signatures. ...]]></summary>

representation learning on documents that naturally occur as graphs, e.g.,
citation or social networks. However, sensitive personal information, such as
documents with people's profiles or relationships as edges, are prone to
privacy leaks, as the trained model might reveal the original input. Although
differential privacy (DP) offers a well-founded privacy-preserving framework,
GCNs pose theoretical and practical challenges due to their training specifics.
We address these challenges by adapting differentially-private gradient-based
training to GCNs and conduct experiments using two optimizers on five NLP
datasets in two languages. We propose a simple yet efficient method based on
random graph splits that not only improves the baseline privacy bounds by a
factor of 2.7 while retaining competitive F1 scores, but also provides strong
privacy guarantees of epsilon = 1.0. We show that, under certain modeling

simplicity its main feature is that no tuning is necessary. Under weak

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[High-quality labels are expensive to obtain for many machine learning tasks,
such as medical image classification tasks. Therefore, probabilistic (weak)
labels produced by weak supervision tools are used to seed a process in which
influential samples with weak labels are identified and cleaned by several
human annotators to improve the model performance. To lower the overall cost
and computational overhead of this process, we propose a solution called CHEF
(CHEap and Fast label cleaning), which consists of the following three
components. First, to reduce the cost of human annotators, we use Infl, which
prioritizes the most influential training samples for cleaning and provides
cleaned labels to save the cost of one human annotator. Second, to accelerate
the sample selector phase and the model constructor phase, we use Increm-Infl
to incrementally produce influential samples, and DeltaGrad-L to incrementally
update the model. Third, we redesign the typical label cleaning pipeline so
that human annotators iteratively clean smaller batch of samples rather than
one big batch of samples. This yields better over all model performance and
enables possible early termination when the expected model performance has been
achieved. Extensive experiments show that our approach gives good model
prediction performance while achieving significant speed-ups.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Entity matching (EM) refers to the problem of identifying tuple pairs in one
or more relations that refer to the same real world entities. Supervised
machine learning (ML) approaches, and deep learning based approaches in
particular, typically achieve state-of-the-art matching results. However, these
approaches require many labeled examples, in the form of matching and
non-matching pairs, which are expensive and time-consuming to label. In this
paper, we introduce Panda, a weakly supervised system specifically designed for
EM. Panda uses the same labeling function abstraction as Snorkel, where
labeling functions (LF) are user-provided programs that can generate large
amounts of (somewhat noisy) labels quickly and cheaply, which can then be
combined via a labeling model to generate accurate final predictions. To
support users developing LFs for EM, Panda provides an integrated development
environment (IDE) that lives in a modern browser architecture. Panda's IDE
facilitates the development, debugging, and life-cycle management of LFs in the
context of EM tasks, similar to how IDEs such as Visual Studio or Eclipse excel
in general-purpose programming. Panda's IDE includes many novel features
purpose-built for EM, such as smart data sampling, a builtin library of EM
utility functions, automatically generated LFs, visual debugging of LFs, and
finally, an EM-specific labeling model. We show in this demo that Panda IDE can
greatly accelerate the development of high-quality EM solutions using weak
supervision.]]></summary>

experiment ever built. Its main objective is to detect the gravitational wave
from the strongest events in the universe by observing if the length of its
4-kilometer arms change by a distance 10,000 times smaller than the diameter of
a proton. Due to its sensitivity, LIGO is prone to the disturbance of external
noises which affects the data being collected to detect the gravitational wave.
These noises are commonly called by the LIGO community as glitches. The
objective of this study is to evaluate the effeciency of various deep trasnfer
learning models namely VGG19, ResNet50V2, VGG16 and ResNet101 to detect glitch
waveform in gravitational wave data. The accuracy achieved by the said models
are 98.98%, 98.35%, 97.56% and 94.73% respectively. Even though the models
achieved fairly high accuracy, it is observed that all of the model suffered
from the lack of data for certain classes which is the main concern found in
the experiment.]]></summary>

comonotonicity as a useful criterion for sufficiency. We revisit the probing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Boundary Representations (B-Reps) are the industry standard in 3D Computer
Aided Design/Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) and industrial design due to their
fidelity in representing stylistic details. However, they have been ignored in
the 3D style research. Existing 3D style metrics typically operate on meshes or
pointclouds, and fail to account for end-user subjectivity by adopting fixed
definitions of style, either through crowd-sourcing for style labels or
hand-crafted features. We propose UVStyle-Net, a style similarity measure for
B-Reps that leverages the style signals in the second order statistics of the
activations in a pre-trained (unsupervised) 3D encoder, and learns their
relative importance to a subjective end-user through few-shot learning. Our
approach differs from all existing data-driven 3D style methods since it may be
used in completely unsupervised settings, which is desirable given the lack of
publicly available labelled B-Rep datasets. More importantly, the few-shot
learning accounts for the inherent subjectivity associated with style. We show
quantitatively that our proposed method with B-Reps is able to capture stronger
style signals than alternative methods on meshes and pointclouds despite its
significantly greater computational efficiency. We also show it is able to
generate meaningful style gradients with respect to the input shape, and that
few-shot learning with as few as two positive examples selected by an end-user
is sufficient to significantly improve the style measure. Finally, we
demonstrate its efficacy on a large unlabeled public dataset of CAD models.
Source code and data will be released in the future.]]></summary>

representation of the high-energy collision event. In this study, we use
low-level detector information from the simulated CMS Open Data samples to
construct the top jet classifiers. To optimize classifier performance we
progressively add low-level information from the CMS tracking detector,
including pixel detector reconstructed hits and impact parameters, and
demonstrate the value of additional tracking information even when no new
spatial structures are added. Relying only on calorimeter energy deposits and
reconstructed pixel detector hits, the end-to-end classifier achieves an AUC
score of 0.975$\pm$0.002 for the task of classifying boosted top quark jets.
After adding derived track quantities, the classifier AUC score increases to
0.9824$\pm$0.0013, serving as the first performance benchmark for these CMS
Open Data samples. We additionally provide a timing performance comparison of
different processor unit architectures for training the network.]]></summary>

tampered regions, the former aims to learn semantic-agnostic and thus more

proteins' functions along with a range of other biological processes. As such,
precise computational methods for protein interface prediction (PIP) come
highly sought after as they could yield significant advances in drug discovery

benchmark dataset for this task, Docking Benchmark 5 (DB5), contains only a
modest 230 complexes for training, validating, and testing different machine
learning algorithms. In this work, we expand on a dataset recently introduced
for this task, the Database of Interacting Protein Structures (DIPS), to
present DIPS-Plus, an enhanced, feature-rich dataset of 42,112 complexes for
geometric deep learning of protein interfaces. The previous version of DIPS
contains only the Cartesian coordinates and types of the atoms comprising a
given protein complex, whereas DIPS-Plus now includes a plethora of new
residue-level features including protrusion indices, half-sphere amino acid
compositions, and new profile hidden Markov model (HMM)-based sequence features
for each amino acid, giving researchers a large, well-curated feature bank for
training protein interface prediction methods. We demonstrate through rigorous
benchmarks that training an existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) model for PIP on

success of high-energy physics experiments, such as the IceCube Neutrino
Observatory. In IceCube, further challenges arise as the detector is situated
at the geographic South Pole where computational resources are limited.
However, to perform real-time analyses and to issue alerts to telescopes around
the world, powerful and fast reconstruction methods are desired. Deep neural
networks can be extremely powerful, and their usage is computationally
inexpensive once the networks are trained. These characteristics make a deep
learning-based approach an excellent candidate for the application in IceCube.
A reconstruction method based on convolutional architectures and hexagonally
shaped kernels is presented. The presented method is robust towards systematic
uncertainties in the simulation and has been tested on experimental data. In
comparison to standard reconstruction methods in IceCube, it can improve upon
the reconstruction accuracy, while reducing the time necessary to run the

photonic systems, we propose a method that finds efficiently the configuration
that has prescribed transfer properties. Specifically, we use physics-informed
machine-learning (PIML) techniques to find the parameters for the efficient
transfer of an electron (or photon) to a targeted state in a non-linear dimer.
We create a machine learning model containing two variables, $\chi_D$, and
$\chi_A$, representing the non-linear terms in the donor and acceptor target
system states. We then introduce a data-free physics-informed loss function as
$1.0 - P_j$, where $P_j$ is the probability, the electron being in the targeted
state, $j$. By minimizing the loss function, we maximize the occupation
probability to the targeted state. The method recovers known results in the
Targeted Energy Transfer (TET) model, and it is then applied to a more complex
system with an additional intermediate state. In this trimer configuration, the
PIML approach discovers desired resonant paths from the donor to acceptor
units. The proposed PIML method is general and may be used in the chemical
design of molecular complexes or engineering design of quantum or photonic
systems.]]></summary>

the development of safety-critical applications. Reinforcement learning
environments -- simple simulations coupled with a problem specification in the
form of a reward function -- are also important to standardize the development
(and benchmarking) of learning algorithms. Yet, full-scale simulators typically
lack portability and parallelizability. Vice versa, many reinforcement learning
environments trade-off realism for high sample throughputs in toy-like
problems. While public data sets have greatly benefited deep learning and
computer vision, we still lack the software tools to simultaneously develop --
and fairly compare -- control theory and reinforcement learning approaches. In
this paper, we propose an open-source OpenAI Gym-like environment for multiple
quadcopters based on the Bullet physics engine. Its multi-agent and vision
based reinforcement learning interfaces, as well as the support of realistic
collisions and aerodynamic effects, make it, to the best of our knowledge, a
first of its kind. We demonstrate its use through several examples, either for
control (trajectory tracking with PID control, multi-robot flight with
downwash, etc.) or reinforcement learning (single and multi-agent stabilization
tasks), hoping to inspire future research that combines control theory and
machine learning.]]></summary>

between entities in complex systems in the physical, biological, social, and
information sciences. Moreover, to study the large-scale behavior of complex
systems, it is important to study mesoscale structures in networks as building
blocks that influence such behavior. In this paper, we present a new approach
for describing low-rank mesoscale structure in networks, and we illustrate our
approach using several synthetic network models and empirical friendship,
collaboration, and protein--protein interaction (PPI) networks. We find that
these networks possess a relatively small number of `latent motifs' that
together can successfully approximate most subnetworks at a fixed mesoscale. We
use an algorithm that we call "network dictionary learning" (NDL), which
combines a network sampling method and nonnegative matrix factorization, to
learn the latent motifs of a given network. The ability to encode a network
using a set of latent motifs has a wide range of applications to
network-analysis tasks, such as comparison, denoising, and edge inference.
Additionally, using our new network denoising and reconstruction (NDR)
algorithm, we demonstrate how to denoise a corrupted network by using only the
latent motifs that one learns directly from the corrupted networks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We address an inherent difficulty in welfare-theoretic fair machine learning
by proposing an equivalently axiomatically-justified alternative and studying
the resulting computational and statistical learning questions. Welfare metrics
quantify overall wellbeing across a population of one or more groups, and
welfare-based objectives and constraints have recently been proposed to
incentivize fair machine learning methods to produce satisfactory solutions
that consider the diverse needs of multiple groups. Unfortunately, many
machine-learning problems are more naturally cast as loss minimization tasks,
rather than utility maximization, which complicates direct application of
welfare-centric methods to fair machine learning. In this work, we define a
complementary measure, termed malfare, measuring overall societal harm (rather
than wellbeing), with axiomatic justification via the standard axioms of
cardinal welfare. We then cast fair machine learning as malfare minimization
over the risk values (expected losses) of each group. Surprisingly, the axioms
of cardinal welfare (malfare) dictate that this is not equivalent to simply
defining utility as negative loss. Building upon these concepts, we define
fair-PAC (FPAC) learning, where an FPAC learner is an algorithm that learns an
$\varepsilon$-$\delta$ malfare-optimal model with bounded sample complexity,
for any data distribution, and for any (axiomatically justified) malfare
concept. Finally, we show broad conditions under which, with appropriate
modifications, standard PAC-learners may be converted to FPAC learners. This
places FPAC learning on firm theoretical ground, as it yields statistical and
computational efficiency guarantees for many well-studied machine-learning
models, and is also practically relevant, as it democratizes fair ML by
providing concrete training algorithms and rigorous generalization guarantees
for these models]]></summary>

enter the underlying network, while using graph neural networks (GNNs) widely
studied for effective representation learning of graphs thanks to its highly
expressive capability via message passing. Our study is motivated by the fact
that existing GNNs cannot be adopted for our problem since message passing to
such edgeless nodes having no connections is impossible. To tackle this
challenge, we propose Edgeless-GNN, a new framework that enables GNNs to
generate node embeddings even for edgeless nodes through unsupervised inductive
learning. Specifically, we start by constructing a $k$-nearest neighbor graph
($k$NNG) based on the similarity of node attributes to replace the GNN's
computation graph defined by the neighborhood-based aggregation of each node.
As our main contributions, the known network structure is used to train model
parameters, while a new loss function is established using energy-based
learning in such a way that our model learns the network structure. For the
edgeless nodes, we inductively infer embeddings for the edgeless nodes by using
edges via $k$NNG construction as a computation graph. By evaluating the
performance of various downstream machine learning (ML) tasks, we empirically
demonstrate that Edgeless-GNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
of inductive network embedding. Moreover, our findings corroborate the
effectiveness of Edgeless-GNN in judiciously combining the replaced computation
graph with our newly designed loss. Our framework is GNN-model-agnostic; thus,
GNN models can be appropriately chosen according to ones' needs and ML tasks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent works in self-supervised learning have advanced the state-of-the-art
by relying on the contrastive learning paradigm, which learns representations
by pushing positive pairs, or similar examples from the same class, closer
together while keeping negative pairs far apart. Despite the empirical
successes, theoretical foundations are limited -- prior analyses assume
conditional independence of the positive pairs given the same class label, but
recent empirical applications use heavily correlated positive pairs (i.e., data
augmentations of the same image). Our work analyzes contrastive learning
without assuming conditional independence of positive pairs using a novel
concept of the augmentation graph on data. Edges in this graph connect
augmentations of the same data, and ground-truth classes naturally form
connected sub-graphs. We propose a loss that performs spectral decomposition on
the population augmentation graph and can be succinctly written as a
contrastive learning objective on neural net representations. Minimizing this
objective leads to features with provable accuracy guarantees under linear
probe evaluation. By standard generalization bounds, these accuracy guarantees
also hold when minimizing the training contrastive loss. Empirically, the
features learned by our objective can match or outperform several strong
baselines on benchmark vision datasets. In all, this work provides the first
provable analysis for contrastive learning where guarantees for linear probe
evaluation can apply to realistic empirical settings.]]></summary>

information readily accessible to retailers, and this information has been
widely used in pricing decisions. When involving personalized information, how
to protect the privacy of such information becomes a critical issue in
practice. In this paper, we consider a dynamic pricing problem over $T$ time
periods with an \emph{unknown} demand function of posted price and personalized
information. At each time $t$, the retailer observes an arriving customer's
personal information and offers a price. The customer then makes the purchase
decision, which will be utilized by the retailer to learn the underlying demand
function. There is potentially a serious privacy concern during this process: a
third party agent might infer the personalized information and purchase
decisions from price changes from the pricing system. Using the fundamental
framework of differential privacy from computer science, we develop a
privacy-preserving dynamic pricing policy, which tries to maximize the retailer
revenue while avoiding information leakage of individual customer's information
and purchasing decisions. To this end, we first introduce a notion of
\emph{anticipating} $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy that is
tailored to dynamic pricing problem. Our policy achieves both the privacy
guarantee and the performance guarantee in terms of regret. Roughly speaking,
for $d$-dimensional personalized information, our algorithm achieves the
expected regret at the order of $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-1} \sqrt{d^3 T})$,
when the customers' information is adversarially chosen. For stochastic
personalized information, the regret bound can be further improved to
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d^2T} + \varepsilon^{-2} d^2)$]]></summary>

model-agnostic, robust against model mismatch, and interpretable. Assuming that
a small number of initial samples are available, we derive the optimal training
density that minimizes the generalization error of local polynomial smoothing
(LPS) with its kernel bandwidth tuned locally: We adopt the mean integrated
squared error (MISE) as a generalization criterion, and use the asymptotic
behavior of the MISE as well as the locally optimal bandwidths (LOB) - the
bandwidth function that minimizes MISE in the asymptotic limit. The asymptotic
expression of our objective then reveals the dependence of the MISE on the
training density, enabling analytic minimization. As a result,we obtain the
optimal training density in a closed-form. The almost model-free nature of our
approach thus helps to encode the essential properties of the target problem,
providing a robust and model-agnostic active learning strategy. Furthermore,
the obtained training density factorizes the influence of local function
complexity, noise level and test density in a transparent and interpretable
way. We validate our theory in numerical simulations, and show that the
proposed active learning method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art
model-agnostic approaches.]]></summary>

Aided Design/Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) and industrial design due to their
fidelity in representing stylistic details. However, they have been ignored in
the 3D style research. Existing 3D style metrics typically operate on meshes or
pointclouds, and fail to account for end-user subjectivity by adopting fixed
definitions of style, either through crowd-sourcing for style labels or
hand-crafted features. We propose UVStyle-Net, a style similarity measure for
B-Reps that leverages the style signals in the second order statistics of the
activations in a pre-trained (unsupervised) 3D encoder, and learns their
relative importance to a subjective end-user through few-shot learning. Our
approach differs from all existing data-driven 3D style methods since it may be
used in completely unsupervised settings, which is desirable given the lack of
publicly available labelled B-Rep datasets. More importantly, the few-shot
learning accounts for the inherent subjectivity associated with style. We show
quantitatively that our proposed method with B-Reps is able to capture stronger
style signals than alternative methods on meshes and pointclouds despite its
significantly greater computational efficiency. We also show it is able to
generate meaningful style gradients with respect to the input shape, and that
few-shot learning with as few as two positive examples selected by an end-user
is sufficient to significantly improve the style measure. Finally, we
demonstrate its efficacy on a large unlabeled public dataset of CAD models.
Source code and data will be released in the future.]]></summary>

settings, they will need to develop an understanding of human mental life.
Intuitive psychology, the ability to reason about hidden mental variables that
drive observable actions, comes naturally to people: even pre-verbal infants
can tell agents from objects, expecting agents to act efficiently to achieve
goals given constraints. Despite recent interest in machine agents that reason
about other agents, it is not clear if such agents learn or hold the core
psychology principles that drive human reasoning. Inspired by cognitive
development studies on intuitive psychology, we present a benchmark consisting
of a large dataset of procedurally generated 3D animations, AGENT (Action,
Goal, Efficiency, coNstraint, uTility), structured around four scenarios (goal
preferences, action efficiency, unobserved constraints, and cost-reward
trade-offs) that probe key concepts of core intuitive psychology. We validate
AGENT with human-ratings, propose an evaluation protocol emphasizing
generalization, and compare two strong baselines built on Bayesian inverse
planning and a Theory of Mind neural network. Our results suggest that to pass
the designed tests of core intuitive psychology at human levels, a model must
acquire or have built-in representations of how agents plan, combining utility

which knowledge discovery is executed interactively between the user and system
in a human-centered manner. The purpose of this study is to develop a method
for the VA of set data aimed at supporting knowledge discovery and member
selection. A typical target application is a visual support system for team
analysis and member selection, by which users can analyze past teams and
examine candidate lineups for new teams. Because there are several
difficulties, such as the combinatorial explosion problem, developing a VA
system of set data is challenging. In this study, we first define the
requirements that the target system should satisfy and clarify the accompanying
challenges. Then we propose a method for the VA of set data, which satisfies
the requirements. The key idea is to model the generation process of sets and
their outputs using a manifold network model. The proposed method visualizes
the relevant factors as a set of topographic maps on which various information
is visualized. Furthermore, using the topographic maps as a bidirectional
interface, users can indicate their targets of interest in the system on these
maps. We demonstrate the proposed method by applying it to basketball teams,
and compare with a benchmark system for outcome prediction and lineup
reconstruction tasks. Because the method can be adapted to individual
application cases by extending the network structure, it can be a general

achieving high accuracy across a variety of machine learning tasks, fair ERM is
hindered by the incompatibility of fairness constraints with stochastic
optimization. In this paper, we propose the fair empirical risk minimization
via exponential R\'enyi mutual information (FERMI) framework. FERMI is built on
a stochastic estimator for exponential R\'enyi mutual information (ERMI), an
information divergence measuring the degree of the dependence of predictions on
sensitive attributes. Theoretically, we show that ERMI upper bounds existing
popular fairness violation metrics, thus controlling ERMI provides guarantees
on other commonly used violations, such as $L_\infty$. We derive an unbiased
estimator for ERMI, which we use to derive the FERMI algorithm. We prove that
FERMI converges for demographic parity, equalized odds, and equal opportunity
notions of fairness in stochastic optimization. Empirically, we show that FERMI
is amenable to large-scale problems with multiple (non-binary) sensitive
attributes and non-binary targets. Extensive experiments show that FERMI
achieves the most favorable tradeoffs between fairness violation and test
accuracy across all tested setups compared with state-of-the-art baselines for
demographic parity, equalized odds, equal opportunity. These benefits are
especially significant for non-binary classification with large sensitive sets
and small batch sizes, showcasing the effectiveness of the FERMI objective and
the developed stochastic algorithm for solving it.]]></summary>

ranging from chemistry all the way to finance. The training of VQAs with

early stage, the simulation of variational quantum circuits on noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices suffers from noisy outputs. Just like
classical deep learning, it also suffers from vanishing gradient problems. It
is a realistic goal to study the topology of loss landscape, to visualize the
curvature information and trainability of these circuits in the existence of
vanishing gradients. In this paper, we calculated the Hessian and visualized
the loss landscape of variational quantum classifiers at different points in
parameter space. The curvature information of variational quantum classifiers
(VQC) is interpreted and the loss function's convergence is shown. It helps us
better understand the behavior of variational quantum circuits to tackle
optimization problems efficiently. We investigated the variational quantum

parity problem to gain insight into the practical behavior of Hessian, then
thoroughly analyzed the behavior of Hessian's eigenvalues on training the

enrich economic models. Our framework takes a standard economic model and
recasts the parameters as fully flexible nonparametric functions, to capture
the rich heterogeneity based on potentially high dimensional or complex
observable characteristics. These "parameter functions" retain the
interpretability, economic meaning, and discipline of classical parameters.
Deep learning is particularly well-suited to structured modeling of
heterogeneity in economics. We show how to design the network architecture to
match the structure of the economic model, delivering novel methodology that
moves deep learning beyond prediction. We prove convergence rates for the
estimated parameter functions. These functions are the key inputs into the
finite-dimensional parameter of inferential interest. We obtain inference based
on a novel influence function calculation that covers any second-stage
parameter and any machine-learning-enriched model that uses a smooth
per-observation loss function. No additional derivations are required. The
score can be taken directly to data, using automatic differentiation if needed.
The researcher need only define the original model and define the parameter of
interest. A key insight is that we need not write down the influence function
in order to evaluate it on the data. Our framework gives new results for a host
of contexts, covering such diverse examples as price elasticities,
willingness-to-pay, and surplus measures in binary or multinomial choice
models, effects of continuous treatment variables, fractional outcome models,
count data, heterogeneous production functions, and more. We apply our

order - one of the most important characteristics of a sequence? Not always! We
found 75% to 90% of the correct predictions of BERT-based classifiers, trained
on many GLUE tasks, remain constant after input words are randomly shuffled.
Despite BERT embeddings are famously contextual, the contribution of each
individual word to downstream tasks is almost unchanged even after the word's
context is shuffled. BERT-based models are able to exploit superficial cues
(e.g. the sentiment of keywords in sentiment analysis; or the word-wise
similarity between sequence-pair inputs in natural language inference) to make
correct decisions when tokens are arranged in random orders. Encouraging
classifiers to capture word order information improves the performance on most
GLUE tasks, SQuAD 2.0 and out-of-samples. Our work suggests that many GLUE
tasks are not challenging machines to understand the meaning of a sentence.]]></summary>

object recognition is now close to that of humans. This success was achieved at
the price of complicated architectures depending on millions of parameters and
it has become quite challenging to understand how particular predictions are
made. Interpretability methods propose to give us this understanding. In this
paper, we study LIME, perhaps one of the most popular. On the theoretical side,
we show that when the number of generated examples is large, LIME explanations
are concentrated around a limit explanation for which we give an explicit
expression. We further this study for elementary shape detectors and linear
models. As a consequence of this analysis, we uncover a connection between LIME
and integrated gradients, another explanation method. More precisely, the LIME
explanations are similar to the sum of integrated gradients over the
superpixels used in the preprocessing step of LIME.]]></summary>

Learning is significantly affected by non-independent and identically
distributed (non-IID) data partitions, even more so in a fully decentralized
setting without a central server. In this paper, we show that the impact of
local class bias, an important type of data non-IIDness, can be significantly
reduced by carefully designing the underlying communication topology. We
present D-Cliques, a novel topology that reduces gradient bias by grouping
nodes in interconnected cliques such that the local joint distribution in a
clique is representative of the global class distribution. We also show how to
adapt the updates of decentralized SGD to obtain unbiased gradients and
implement an effective momentum with D-Cliques. Our empirical evaluation on
MNIST and CIFAR10 demonstrates that our approach provides similar convergence
speed as a fully-connected topology with a significant reduction in the number
of edges and messages. In a 1000-node topology, D-Cliques requires 98% less
edges and 96% less total messages, with further possible gains using a
small-world topology across cliques.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most change detection methods assume that pre-change and post-change images
are acquired by the same sensor. However, in many real-life scenarios, e.g.,
natural disaster, it is more practical to use the latest available images
before and after the occurrence of incidence, which may be acquired using
different sensors. In particular, we are interested in the combination of the
images acquired by optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. SAR
images appear vastly different from the optical images even when capturing the
same scene. Adding to this, change detection methods are often constrained to
use only target image-pair, no labeled data, and no additional unlabeled data.
Such constraints limit the scope of traditional supervised machine learning and
unsupervised generative approaches for multi-sensor change detection. Recent
rapid development of self-supervised learning methods has shown that some of
them can even work with only few images. Motivated by this, in this work we
propose a method for multi-sensor change detection using only the unlabeled
target bi-temporal images that are used for training a network in
self-supervised fashion by using deep clustering and contrastive learning. The
proposed method is evaluated on four multi-modal bi-temporal scenes showing
change and the benefits of our self-supervised approach are demonstrated.]]></summary>

behavior of a time series, are often deployed with limited resources, e.g., to
edge computing settings such as mobile phones or industrial sensors. In these
scenarios it may be beneficial to trade the cost of collecting an environmental
measurement against the quality or "fidelity" of this measurement and how the
measurement affects changepoint estimation. For instance, one might decide
between inertial measurements or GPS to determine changepoints for motion. A
Bayesian approach to changepoint detection is particularly appealing because we
can represent our posterior uncertainty about changepoints and make active,
cost-sensitive decisions about data fidelity to reduce this posterior
uncertainty. Moreover, the total cost could be dramatically lowered through
active fidelity switching, while remaining robust to changes in data
distribution. We propose a multi-fidelity approach that makes cost-sensitive
decisions about which data fidelity to collect based on maximizing information
gain with respect to changepoints. We evaluate this framework on synthetic,
video, and audio data and show that this information-based approach results in
accurate predictions while reducing total cost.]]></summary>

the flattest directions of the true loss surface. We demonstrate that typical

constants) serve to bias relative movement towards flat directions relative to
sharp directions, effectively amplifying the noise-to-signal ratio and harming
generalisation. We further demonstrate that the numerical stability/damping
constant used in these methods can be decomposed into a learning rate reduction
and linear shrinkage of the estimated curvature matrix. We then demonstrate
significant generalisation improvements by increasing the shrinkage
coefficient, closing the generalisation gap entirely in both Logistic
Regression and Deep Neural Network experiments. Finally, we show that other
popular modifications to adaptive methods, such as decoupled weight decay and
partial adaptivity can be shown to calibrate parameter updates to make better

number of new architectures as well as novel applications. However, current
research focuses on proposing and evaluating specific architectural designs of
GNNs, as opposed to studying the more general design space of GNNs that
consists of a Cartesian product of different design dimensions, such as the
number of layers or the type of the aggregation function. Additionally, GNN
designs are often specialized to a single task, yet few efforts have been made
to understand how to quickly find the best GNN design for a novel task or a
novel dataset. Here we define and systematically study the architectural design
space for GNNs which consists of 315,000 different designs over 32 different
predictive tasks. Our approach features three key innovations: (1) A general
GNN design space; (2) a GNN task space with a similarity metric, so that for a
given novel task/dataset, we can quickly identify/transfer the best performing
architecture; (3) an efficient and effective design space evaluation method
which allows insights to be distilled from a huge number of model-task
combinations. Our key results include: (1) A comprehensive set of guidelines
for designing well-performing GNNs; (2) while best GNN designs for different
tasks vary significantly, the GNN task space allows for transferring the best
designs across different tasks; (3) models discovered using our design space
achieve state-of-the-art performance. Overall, our work offers a principled and
scalable approach to transition from studying individual GNN designs for
specific tasks, to systematically studying the GNN design space and the task
space. Finally, we release GraphGym, a powerful platform for exploring
different GNN designs and tasks. GraphGym features modularized GNN
implementation, standardized GNN evaluation, and reproducible and scalable

ranking trajectories that the agent observes, while the policy update is
performed with the newly inferred, typically dense reward function. We
introduce theory that shows that, under certain conditions, this alteration of
the reward function will not change the optimal policy of the original MDP,
while potentially increasing learning speed significantly. Experimental results
on several sparse-reward environments demonstrate that, across multiple

monitoring if the predicted states satisfy requirements -- offers a promising
paradigm in supporting the decision making of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS).
Existing works of predictive monitoring mostly focus on monitoring individual
predictions rather than sequential predictions. We develop a novel approach for
monitoring sequential predictions generated from Bayesian Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs) that can capture the inherent uncertainty in CPS, drawing on
insights from our study of real-world CPS datasets. We propose a new logic
named \emph{Signal Temporal Logic with Uncertainty} (STL-U) to monitor a
flowpipe containing an infinite set of uncertain sequences predicted by
Bayesian RNNs. We define STL-U strong and weak satisfaction semantics based on
if all or some sequences contained in a flowpipe satisfy the requirement. We
also develop methods to compute the range of confidence levels under which a
flowpipe is guaranteed to strongly (weakly) satisfy an STL-U formula.
Furthermore, we develop novel criteria that leverage STL-U monitoring results
to calibrate the uncertainty estimation in Bayesian RNNs. Finally, we evaluate
the proposed approach via experiments with real-world datasets and a simulated
smart city case study, which show very encouraging results of STL-U based
predictive monitoring approach outperforming baselines.]]></summary>

Specifically, there is no general algorithm for the adversarial RKHS bandit

hinders practical application. We address these issues by considering a novel
amalgamation of approximation theory and the misspecified linear bandit

concurrently trained models by encouraging them to represent the same function
through an auxiliary loss. This contrasts with the more commonly used
fully-synchronous data-parallel stochastic gradient descent methods, where
different model replicas average their gradients (or parameters) at every
iteration and thus maintain identical parameters. We investigate codistillation
in a distributed training setup, complementing previous work which focused on
extremely large batch sizes. Surprisingly, we find that even at moderate batch
sizes, models trained with codistillation can perform as well as models trained
with synchronous data-parallel methods, despite using a much weaker
synchronization mechanism. These findings hold across a range of batch sizes
and learning rate schedules, as well as different kinds of models and datasets.
Obtaining this level of accuracy, however, requires properly accounting for the
regularization effect of codistillation, which we highlight through several
empirical observations. Overall, this work contributes to a better
understanding of codistillation and how to best take advantage of it in a

decisions and ensuring treatment outcomes. However, medical jargon and the
complex structure of professional language in this domain make health
information especially hard to interpret. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need
for automated methods to enhance the accessibility of the biomedical literature
to the general population. This problem can be framed as a type of translation
problem between the language of healthcare professionals, and that of the
general public. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of automated
generation of lay language summaries of biomedical scientific reviews, and
construct a dataset to support the development and evaluation of automated
methods through which to enhance the accessibility of the biomedical
literature. We conduct analyses of the various challenges in solving this task,
including not only summarization of the key points but also explanation of
background knowledge and simplification of professional language. We experiment
with state-of-the-art summarization models as well as several data augmentation
techniques, and evaluate their performance using both automated metrics and
human assessment. Results indicate that automatically generated summaries
produced using contemporary neural architectures can achieve promising quality
and readability as compared with reference summaries developed for the lay
public by experts (best ROUGE-L of 50.24 and Flesch-Kincaid readability score
of 13.30). We also discuss the limitations of the current attempt, providing
insights and directions for future work.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Building neural network classifiers with an ability to distinguish between in
and out-of distribution inputs is an important step towards faithful deep
learning systems. Some of the successful approaches for this, resort to
architectural novelties, such as ensembles, with increased complexities in
terms of the number of parameters and training procedures. Whereas some other
approaches make use of surrogate samples, which are easy to create and work as
proxies for actual out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, to train the networks for
OOD detection. In this paper, we propose a very simple approach for enhancing
the ability of a pretrained network to detect OOD inputs without even altering
the original parameter values. We define a probabilistic trust interval for
each weight parameter of the network and optimize its size according to the
in-distribution (ID) inputs. It allows the network to sample additional weight
values along with the original values at the time of inference and use the
observed disagreement among the corresponding outputs for OOD detection. In
order to capture the disagreement effectively, we also propose a measure and
establish its suitability using empirical evidence. Our approach outperforms
the existing state-of-the-art methods on various OOD datasets by considerable
margins without using any real or surrogate OOD samples. We also analyze the
performance of our approach on adversarial and corrupted inputs such as
CIFAR-10-C and demonstrate its ability to clearly distinguish such inputs as
well. By using fundamental theorem of calculus on neural networks, we explain
why our technique doesn't need to observe OOD samples during training to
achieve results better than the previous works.]]></summary>

training robot controllers. This is especially true for soft robots that are
more adaptive and safe but also more difficult to accurately model and control.
The sim2real gap is the main barrier to successfully transfer policies from
simulation to a real robot. System identification can be applied to reduce this
gap but traditional identification methods require a lot of manual tuning.
Data-driven alternatives can tune dynamical models directly from data but are
often data hungry, which also incorporates human effort in collecting data.
This work proposes a data-driven, end-to-end differentiable simulator focused
on the exciting but challenging domain of tensegrity robots. To the best of the
authors' knowledge, this is the first differentiable physics engine for
tensegrity robots that supports cable, contact, and actuation modeling. The aim
is to develop a reasonably simplified, data-driven simulation, which can learn
approximate dynamics with limited ground truth data. The dynamics must be
accurate enough to generate policies that can be transferred back to the
ground-truth system. As a first step in this direction, the current work
demonstrates sim2sim transfer, where the unknown physical model of MuJoCo acts
as a ground truth system. Two different tensegrity robots are used for
evaluation and learning of locomotion policies, a 6-bar and a 3-bar tensegrity.
The results indicate that only 0.25\% of ground truth data are needed to train
a policy that works on the ground truth system when the differentiable engine
is used for training against training the policy directly on the ground truth
system.]]></summary>

Convolutional Neural Networks (G-CNNs). In this framework, a network layer is
seen as a set of PDE-solvers where geometrically meaningful PDE-coefficients
become the layer's trainable weights. Formulating our PDEs on homogeneous
spaces allows these networks to be designed with built-in symmetries such as
rotation in addition to the standard translation equivariance of CNNs.

Having all the desired symmetries included in the design obviates the need to
include them by means of costly techniques such as data augmentation. We will
discuss our PDE-based G-CNNs (PDE-G-CNNs) in a general homogeneous space
setting while also going into the specifics of our primary case of interest:
roto-translation equivariance.

We solve the PDE of interest by a combination of linear group convolutions
and non-linear morphological group convolutions with analytic kernel
approximations that we underpin with formal theorems. Our kernel approximations
allow for fast GPU-implementation of the PDE-solvers, we release our
implementation with this article. Just like for linear convolution a
morphological convolution is specified by a kernel that we train in our
PDE-G-CNNs. In PDE-G-CNNs we do not use non-linearities such as max/min-pooling
and ReLUs as they are already subsumed by morphological convolutions.

We present a set of experiments to demonstrate the strength of the proposed
PDE-G-CNNs in increasing the performance of deep learning based imaging
applications with far fewer parameters than traditional CNNs.]]></summary>

artworks to determine their motifs and themes andto characterize the way these
are represented. It is a subject of active research for a variety of purposes,
including the interpretation of meaning, the investigation of the origin and
diffusion in time and space of representations, and the study of influences
across artists and art works. With the proliferation of digital archives of art
images, the possibility arises of applying Computer Vision techniques to the
analysis of art images at an unprecedented scale, which may support iconography
research and education. In this paper we introduce a novel paintings data set
for iconography classification and present the quantitativeand qualitative
results of applying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to the
recognition of the iconography of artworks. The proposed classifier achieves
good performances (71.17% Precision, 70.89% Recall, 70.25% F1-Score and 72.73%
Average Precision) in the task of identifying saints in Christian religious
paintings, a task made difficult by the presence of classes with very similar
visual features. Qualitative analysis of the results shows that the CNN focuses
on the traditional iconic motifs that characterize the representation of each
saint and exploits such hints to attain correct identification. The ultimate
goal of our work is to enable the automatic extraction, decomposition, and
comparison of iconography elements to support iconographic studies and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We investigate gradient descent training of wide neural networks and the
corresponding implicit bias in function space. For univariate regression, we
show that the solution of training a width-$n$ shallow ReLU network is within
$n^{- 1/2}$ of the function which fits the training data and whose difference
from the initial function has the smallest 2-norm of the second derivative
weighted by a curvature penalty that depends on the probability distribution
that is used to initialize the network parameters. We compute the curvature
penalty function explicitly for various common initialization procedures. For
instance, asymmetric initialization with a uniform distribution yields a
constant curvature penalty, and thence the solution function is the natural
cubic spline interpolation of the training data. We obtain a similar result for
different activation functions. For multivariate regression we show an
analogous result, whereby the second derivative is replaced by the Radon
transform of a fractional Laplacian. For initialization schemes that yield a
constant penalty function, the solutions are polyharmonic splines. Moreover, we
show that the training trajectories are captured by trajectories of smoothing
splines with decreasing regularization strength.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Price movement forecasting aims at predicting the future trends of financial
assets based on the current market conditions and other relevant information.
Recently, machine learning(ML) methods have become increasingly popular and
achieved promising results for price movement forecasting in both academia and
industry. Most existing ML solutions formulate the forecasting problem as a
classification(to predict the direction) or a regression(to predict the return)
problem in the entire set of training data. However, due to the extremely low
signal-to-noise ratio and stochastic nature of financial data, good trading
opportunities are extremely scarce. As a result, without careful selection of
potentially profitable samples, such ML methods are prone to capture the
patterns of noises instead of real signals. To address the above issues, we
propose a novel framework-LARA(Locality-Aware Attention and Adaptive Refined
Labeling), which contains the following three components: 1)Locality-aware
attention automatically extracts the potentially profitable samples by
attending to their label information in order to construct a more accurate
classifier on these selected samples. 2)Adaptive refined labeling further
iteratively refines the labels, alleviating the noise of samples. 3)Equipped
with metric learning techniques, Locality-aware attention enjoys task-specific
distance metrics and distributes attention on potentially profitable samples in
a more effective way. To validate our method, we conduct comprehensive
experiments on three real-world financial markets: ETFs, the China's A-share
stock market, and the cryptocurrency market. LARA achieves superior performance
compared with the time-series analysis methods and a set of machine learning
based competitors on the Qlib platform. Extensive ablation studies and
experiments demonstrate that LARA indeed captures more reliable trading
opportunities.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The predict-then-optimize framework is fundamental in many practical
settings: predict the unknown parameters of an optimization problem, and then
solve the problem using the predicted values of the parameters. A natural loss
function in this environment is to consider the cost of the decisions induced
by the predicted parameters, in contrast to the prediction error of the
parameters. This loss function was recently introduced in Elmachtoub and Grigas
(2017) and referred to as the Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) loss. In this
work, we seek to provide bounds on how well the performance of a prediction
model fit on training data generalizes out-of-sample, in the context of the SPO
loss. Since the SPO loss is non-convex and non-Lipschitz, standard results for
deriving generalization bounds do not apply.

We first derive bounds based on the Natarajan dimension that, in the case of
a polyhedral feasible region, scale at most logarithmically in the number of
extreme points, but, in the case of a general convex feasible region, have
linear dependence on the decision dimension. By exploiting the structure of the
SPO loss function and a key property of the feasible region, which we denote as
the strength property, we can dramatically improve the dependence on the
decision and feature dimensions. Our approach and analysis rely on placing a
margin around problematic predictions that do not yield unique optimal
solutions, and then providing generalization bounds in the context of a
modified margin SPO loss function that is Lipschitz continuous. Finally, we
characterize the strength property and show that the modified SPO loss can be
computed efficiently for both strongly convex bodies and polytopes with an
explicit extreme point representation.]]></summary>

model natural images and raw audio waveforms through a paired diffusion and
reverse processes. The unique property of the reverse process (namely,
eliminating non-target signals from the Gaussian noise and noisy signals) could
be utilized to restore clean signals. Based on this property, we propose a
diffusion probabilistic model-based speech enhancement (DiffuSE) model that
aims to recover clean speech signals from noisy signals. The fundamental
architecture of the proposed DiffuSE model is similar to that of DiffWave--a
high-quality audio waveform generation model that has a relatively low
computational cost and footprint. To attain better enhancement performance, we
designed an advanced reverse process, termed the supportive reverse process,
which adds noisy speech in each time-step to the predicted speech. The
experimental results show that DiffuSE yields performance that is comparable to
related audio generative models on the standardized Voice Bank corpus SE task.
Moreover, relative to the generally suggested full sampling schedule, the
proposed supportive reverse process especially improved the fast sampling,
taking few steps to yield better enhancement results over the conventional full
step inference process.]]></summary>

propose a general decentralized federated learning framework to strike a

proposed framework performs both multiple local updates and multiple inter-node
communications periodically, unifying traditional decentralized SGD methods. We
establish strong convergence guarantees for the proposed DFL algorithm without
the assumption of convex objective function. The balance of communication and
computation rounds is essential to optimize decentralized federated learning
under constrained communication and computation resources. For further
improving communication-efficiency of DFL, compressed communication is applied
to DFL, named DFL with compressed communication (C-DFL). The proposed C-DFL
exhibits linear convergence for strongly convex objectives. Experiment results
based on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets illustrate the superiority of DFL over

collaboratively contribute to a global neural network model while keeping the
training data locally. Unlike the centralized training setting, the non-IID and
imbalanced (statistical heterogeneity) training data of FL is distributed in
the federated network, which will increase the divergences between the local
models and global model, further degrading performance. In this paper, we
propose a novel clustered federated learning (CFL) framework FedGroup, in which
we 1) group the training of clients based on the similarities between the
clients' optimization directions for high training performance; 2) construct a
new data-driven distance measure to improve the efficiency of the client
clustering procedure. 3) implement a newcomer device cold start mechanism based
on the auxiliary global model for framework scalability and practicality.

FedGroup can achieve improvements by dividing joint optimization into groups
of sub-optimization and can be combined with FL optimizer FedProx. The
convergence and complexity are analyzed to demonstrate the efficiency of our
proposed framework. We also evaluate FedGroup and FedGrouProx (combined with
FedProx) on several open datasets and made comparisons with related CFL
frameworks. The results show that FedGroup can significantly improve absolute

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context: Machine Learning (ML) has been at the heart of many innovations over
the past years. However, including it in so-called 'safety-critical' systems
such as automotive or aeronautic has proven to be very challenging, since the
shift in paradigm that ML brings completely changes traditional certification
approaches.

Objective: This paper aims to elucidate challenges related to the
certification of ML-based safety-critical systems, as well as the solutions
that are proposed in the literature to tackle them, answering the question 'How
to Certify Machine Learning Based Safety-critical Systems?'.

Method: We conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of research papers
published between 2015 to 2020, covering topics related to the certification of
ML systems. In total, we identified 229 papers covering topics considered to be
the main pillars of ML certification: Robustness, Uncertainty, Explainability,
Verification, Safe Reinforcement Learning, and Direct Certification. We
analyzed the main trends and problems of each sub-field and provided summaries
of the papers extracted.

Results: The SLR results highlighted the enthusiasm of the community for this
subject, as well as the lack of diversity in terms of datasets and type of
models. It also emphasized the need to further develop connections between
academia and industries to deepen the domain study. Finally, it also
illustrated the necessity to build connections between the above mention main
pillars that are for now mainly studied separately.

Conclusion: We highlighted current efforts deployed to enable the
certification of ML based software systems, and discuss some future research

provide platforms for empowering freedom of expressions and individual voices,
but also enables people to express anti-social behavior like online harassment,
cyberbullying, and hate speech. Numerous works have been proposed to utilize
textual data for social and anti-social behavior analysis, by predicting the
contexts mostly for highly-resourced languages like English. However, some
languages are under-resourced, e.g., South Asian languages like Bengali, that
lack computational resources for accurate natural language processing (NLP). In
this paper, we propose an explainable approach for hate speech detection from
the under-resourced Bengali language, which we called DeepHateExplainer.
Bengali texts are first comprehensively preprocessed, before classifying them
into political, personal, geopolitical, and religious hates using a neural
ensemble method of transformer-based neural architectures (i.e., monolingual
Bangla BERT-base, multilingual BERT-cased/uncased, and XLM-RoBERTa).
Important~(most and least) terms are then identified using sensitivity analysis
and layer-wise relevance propagation~(LRP), before providing
human-interpretable explanations. Finally, we compute comprehensiveness and
sufficiency scores to measure the quality of explanations w.r.t faithfulness.
Evaluations against machine learning~(linear and tree-based models) and neural
networks (i.e., CNN, Bi-LSTM, and Conv-LSTM with word embeddings) baselines
yield F1-scores of 78%, 91%, 89%, and 84%, for political, personal,
geopolitical, and religious hates, respectively, outperforming both ML and DNN
baselines.]]></summary>

private information from a wireless signal classifier. Machine learning (ML)
provides powerful means to classify wireless signals, e.g., for PHY-layer
authentication. As an adversarial machine learning attack, the MIA infers
whether a signal of interest has been used in the training data of a target
classifier. This private information incorporates waveform, channel, and device
characteristics, and if leaked, can be exploited by an adversary to identify
vulnerabilities of the underlying ML model (e.g., to infiltrate the PHY-layer
authentication). One challenge for the over-the-air MIA is that the received
signals and consequently the RF fingerprints at the adversary and the intended
receiver differ due to the discrepancy in channel conditions. Therefore, the
adversary first builds a surrogate classifier by observing the spectrum and
then launches the black-box MIA on this classifier. The MIA results show that
the adversary can reliably infer signals (and potentially the radio and channel
information) used to build the target classifier. Therefore, a proactive
defense is developed against the MIA by building a shadow MIA model and fooling
the adversary. This defense can successfully reduce the MIA accuracy and
prevent information leakage from the wireless signal classifier.]]></summary>

Moreover, we extend the use of cross derivatives as an explanatory device in

gradient-based explanatory tool for CNNs, to the higher order. While Grad-CAM
can only explain the importance of individual objects in images, our method,

physics experiments, yielding a multitude of advances, predominantly in event
classification and reconstruction tasks. Many of these applications have been
adopted from other domains. However, data in the field of physics are unique in
the context of machine learning, insofar as their generation process and the
laws and symmetries they abide by are usually well understood. Most commonly
used deep learning architectures fail at utilizing this available information.
In contrast, more traditional likelihood-based methods are capable of
exploiting domain knowledge, but they are often limited by computational
complexity. In this contribution, a hybrid approach is presented that utilizes
generative neural networks to approximate the likelihood, which may then be
used in a traditional maximum-likelihood setting. Domain knowledge, such as
invariances and detector characteristics, can easily be incorporated in this
approach. The hybrid approach is illustrated by the example of event
reconstruction in IceCube.]]></summary>

deep neural networks (DNNs) into making wrong predictions. Enhancing the
adversarial robustness of DNNs has gained considerable interest in recent
years. Although image transformation-based defenses were widely considered at
an earlier time, most of them have been defeated by adaptive attacks. In this
paper, we propose a new image transformation defense based on error diffusion
halftoning, and combine it with adversarial training to defend against
adversarial examples. Error diffusion halftoning projects an image into a 1-bit
space and diffuses quantization error to neighboring pixels. This process can
remove adversarial perturbations from a given image while maintaining
acceptable image quality in the meantime in favor of recognition. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to improve adversarial
robustness even under advanced adaptive attacks, while most of the other image
transformation-based defenses do not. We show that a proper image
transformation can still be an effective defense approach. Code:

Corrupted data can severely bias the learned model and can also lead to invalid
inferences. We present, Picket, a simple framework to safeguard against data
corruptions during both training and deployment of machine learning models over
tabular data. For the training stage, Picket identifies and removes corrupted
data points from the training data to avoid obtaining a biased model. For the
deployment stage, Picket flags, in an online manner, corrupted query points to
a trained machine learning model that due to noise will result in incorrect
predictions. To detect corrupted data, Picket uses a self-supervised deep
learning model for mixed-type tabular data, which we call PicketNet. To
minimize the burden of deployment, learning a PicketNet model does not require
any human-labeled data. Picket is designed as a plugin that can increase the
robustness of any machine learning pipeline. We evaluate Picket on a diverse
array of real-world data considering different corruption models that include
systematic and adversarial noise during both training and testing. We show that
Picket consistently safeguards against corrupted data during both training and
deployment of various models ranging from SVMs to neural networks, beating a

models to robust outlier-detection models.]]></summary>

morbidity rate and a mortality rate of more than three percent, which seriously
endangers human health. The main method of acquiring brain tumors in the clinic
is MRI. Segmentation of brain tumor regions from multi-modal MRI scan images is
helpful for treatment inspection, post-diagnosis monitoring, and effect
evaluation of patients. However, the common operation in clinical brain tumor
segmentation is still manual segmentation, lead to its time-consuming and large
performance difference between different operators, a consistent and accurate
automatic segmentation method is urgently needed. Methods: To meet the above
challenges, we propose an automatic brain tumor MRI data segmentation framework
which is called AGSE-VNet. In our study, the Squeeze and Excite (SE) module is
added to each encoder, the Attention Guide Filter (AG) module is added to each
decoder, using the channel relationship to automatically enhance the useful
information in the channel to suppress the useless information, and use the
attention mechanism to guide the edge information and remove the influence of
irrelevant information such as noise. Results: We used the BraTS2020 challenge
online verification tool to evaluate our approach. The focus of verification is
that the Dice scores of the whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC) and enhanced
tumor (ET) are 0.68, 0.85 and 0.70, respectively. Conclusion: Although MRI
images have different intensities, AGSE-VNet is not affected by the size of the
tumor, and can more accurately extract the features of the three regions, it
has achieved impressive results and made outstanding contributions to the
clinical diagnosis and treatment of brain tumor patients.]]></summary>

changes in image style, image blurriness, geographic location, camera
operation, and more. With our new datasets, we take stock of previously
proposed methods for improving out-of-distribution robustness and put them to
the test. We find that using larger models and artificial data augmentations
can improve robustness on real-world distribution shifts, contrary to claims in
prior work. We find improvements in artificial robustness benchmarks can
transfer to real-world distribution shifts, contrary to claims in prior work.
Motivated by our observation that data augmentations can help with real-world
distribution shifts, we also introduce a new data augmentation method which
advances the state-of-the-art and outperforms models pretrained with 1000 times
more labeled data. Overall we find that some methods consistently help with
distribution shifts in texture and local image statistics, but these methods do
not help with some other distribution shifts like geographic changes. Our
results show that future research must study multiple distribution shifts
simultaneously, as we demonstrate that no evaluated method consistently
improves robustness.]]></summary>

suffer from high variance of gradient estimate. To reduce the variance, the
state value function is applied commonly. However, the effect of the state
value function becomes limited in stochastic dynamic environments, where the
unexpected state dynamics and rewards will increase the variance. In this
paper, we propose to replace the state value function with a novel hindsight
value function, which leverages the information from the future to reduce the
variance of the gradient estimate for stochastic dynamic environments.

Particularly, to obtain an ideally unbiased gradient estimate, we propose an
information-theoretic approach, which optimizes the embeddings of the future to
be independent of previous actions. In our experiments, we apply the proposed
hindsight value function in stochastic dynamic environments, including
discrete-action environments and continuous-action environments. Compared with
the standard state value function, the proposed hindsight value function
consistently reduces the variance, stabilizes the training, and improves the
eventual policy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While clients' sampling is a central operation of current state-of-the-art
federated learning (FL) approaches, the impact of this procedure on the
convergence and speed of FL remains to date under-investigated. In this work we
introduce a novel decomposition theorem for the convergence of FL, allowing to
clearly quantify the impact of client sampling on the global model update.
Contrarily to previous convergence analyses, our theorem provides the exact
decomposition of a given convergence step, thus enabling accurate
considerations about the role of client sampling and heterogeneity. First, we
provide a theoretical ground for previously reported results on the
relationship between FL convergence and the variance of the aggregation
weights. Second, we prove for the first time that the quality of FL convergence
is also impacted by the resulting covariance between aggregation weights.
Third, we establish that the sum of the aggregation weights is another source
of slow-down and should be equal to 1 to improve FL convergence speed. Our
theory is general, and is here applied to Multinomial Distribution (MD) and
Uniform sampling, the two default client sampling in FL, and demonstrated
through a series of experiments in non-iid and unbalanced scenarios. Our
results suggest that MD sampling should be used as default sampling scheme, due
to the resilience to the changes in data ratio during the learning process,
while Uniform sampling is superior only in the special case when clients have
the same amount of data.]]></summary>

contrastive loss tends to bias on high-frequency classes and thus increases the

analyze our PaCo loss under a balanced setting. Our analysis demonstrates that
PaCo can adaptively enhance the intensity of pushing samples of the same class

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The performance of spectral clustering heavily relies on the quality of
affinity matrix. A variety of affinity-matrix-construction methods have been
proposed but they have hyper-parameters to determine beforehand, which requires
strong experience and lead to difficulty in real applications especially when
the inter-cluster similarity is high or/and the dataset is large. On the other
hand, we often have to determine to use a linear model or a nonlinear model,
which still depends on experience. To solve these two problems, in this paper,
we present an eigen-gap guided search method for subspace clustering. The main
idea is to find the most reliable affinity matrix among a set of candidates
constructed by linear and kernel regressions, where the reliability is
quantified by the \textit{relative-eigen-gap} of graph Laplacian defined in
this paper. We show, theoretically and numerically, that the Laplacian matrix
with a larger relative-eigen-gap often yields a higher clustering accuracy and
stability. Our method is able to automatically search the best model and
hyper-parameters in a pre-defined space. The search space is very easy to
determine and can be arbitrarily large, though a relatively compact search
space can reduce the highly unnecessary computation. Our method has high
flexibility and convenience in real applications, and also has low
computational cost because the affinity matrix is not computed by iterative
optimization. We extend the method to large-scale datasets such as MNIST, on
which the time cost is less than 90s and the clustering accuracy is
state-of-the-art. Extensive experiments of natural image clustering show that
our method is more stable, accurate, and efficient than baseline methods.]]></summary>

due to their economic efficiency. Their economic viability depends to a large
extent on the resulting product quality and the associated customer
satisfaction as well as on possible downtimes. In particular, the occurrence of
increased tool wear reduces the product quality and leads to downtimes, which
is why considerable research has been carried out in recent years with regard
to wear detection. While processes have widely been monitored based on force
and acceleration signals, a new approach is pursued in this paper. Blanked
workpieces manufactured by punches with 16 different wear states are
photographed and then used as inputs for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to
classify wear states. The results show that wear states can be predicted with
surprisingly high accuracy, opening up new possibilities and research

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Networks are frequently used to model complex systems comprised of
interacting elements. While links capture the topology of direct interactions,
the true complexity of many systems originates from higher-order patterns in
paths by which nodes can indirectly influence each other. Path data,
representing ordered sequences of consecutive direct interactions, can be used
to model these patterns. However, to avoid overfitting, such models should only
consider those higher-order patterns for which the data provide sufficient
statistical evidence. On the other hand, we hypothesise that network models,
which capture only direct interactions, underfit higher-order patterns present
in data. Consequently, both approaches are likely to misidentify influential
nodes in complex networks. We contribute to this issue by proposing eight
centrality measures based on MOGen, a multi-order generative model that
accounts for all paths up to a maximum distance but disregards paths at higher
distances. We compare MOGen-based centralities to equivalent measures for
network models and path data in a prediction experiment where we aim to
identify influential nodes in out-of-sample data. Our results show strong
evidence supporting our hypothesis. MOGen consistently outperforms both the
network model and path-based prediction. We further show that the performance
difference between MOGen and the path-based approach disappears if we have
sufficient observations, confirming that the error is due to overfitting.]]></summary>

approach in robust machine learning is to exert lower weights on samples which
are likely to be noisy or hard. This study reveals another undiscovered
strategy, namely, compensating, that has also been widely used in machine
learning. Learning with compensating is called compensation learning and a
systematic taxonomy is constructed for it in this study. In our taxonomy,
compensation learning is divided on the basis of the compensation targets,
inference manners, and granularity levels. Many existing learning algorithms
including some classical ones can be seen as a special case of compensation
learning or partially leveraging compensating. Furthermore, a family of new
learning algorithms can be obtained by plugging the compensation learning into
existing learning algorithms. Specifically, three concrete new learning
algorithms are proposed for robust machine learning. Extensive experiments on
text sentiment analysis, image classification, and graph classification verify
the effectiveness of the three new algorithms. Compensation learning can also
be used in various learning scenarios, such as imbalance learning, clustering,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, a shallow Ritz-type neural network for solving elliptic
problems with delta function singular sources on an interface is developed.
There are three novel features in the present work; namely, (i) the delta
function singularity is naturally removed, (ii) level set function is
introduced as a feather input, (iii) it is completely shallow consisting of
only one hidden layer. We first introduce the energy functional of the problem
and then transform the contribution of singular sources to a regular surface
integral along the interface. In such a way the delta function singularity can
be naturally removed without the introduction of discrete delta function that
is commonly used in traditional regularization methods such as the well-known
immersed boundary method. The original problem is then reformulated as a
minimization problem. We propose a shallow Ritz-type neural network with one
hidden layer to approximate the global minimizer of the energy functional. As a
result, the network is trained by minimizing the loss function that is a
discrete version of the energy. In addition, we include the level set function
of the interface as a feature input and find that it significantly improves the
training efficiency and accuracy. We perform a series of numerical tests to
demonstrate the accuracy of the present network as well as its capability for
problems in irregular domains and in higher dimensions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The planted clique problem is well-studied in the context of observing,
explaining, and predicting interesting computational phenomena associated with
statistical problems. When equating computational efficiency with the existence
of polynomial time algorithms, the computational hardness of (some variant of)
the planted clique problem can be used to infer the computational hardness of a
host of other statistical problems.

Is this ability to transfer computational hardness from (some variant of) the
planted clique problem to other statistical problems robust to changing our
notion of computational efficiency to space efficiency?

We answer this question affirmatively for three different statistical
problems, namely Sparse PCA, submatrix detection, and testing almost k-wise
independence. The key challenge is that space efficient randomized reductions
need to repeatedly access the randomness they use. Known reductions to these
problems are all randomized and need polynomially many random bits to
implement. Since we can not store polynomially many random bits in memory, it
is unclear how to implement these existing reductions space efficiently. There
are two ideas involved in circumventing this issue and implementing known
reductions to these problems space efficiently.

1. When solving statistical problems, we can use parts of the input itself as
randomness.

2. Secret leakage variants of the planted clique problem with appropriate
secret leakage can be more useful than the standard planted clique problem when
we want to use parts of the input as randomness.

clots. PE accounts for approximately 100,000 deaths per year in the United
States alone. The clinical presentation of PE is often nonspecific, making the
diagnosis challenging. Thus, rapid and accurate risk stratification is of
paramount importance. High-risk PE is caused by right ventricular (RV)
dysfunction from acute pressure overload, which in return can help identify
which patients require more aggressive therapy. Reconstructed four-chamber
views of the heart on chest CT can detect right ventricular enlargement. CT
pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the golden standard in the diagnostic workup of
suspected PE. Therefore, it can link between diagnosis and risk stratification
strategies. We developed a weakly supervised deep learning algorithm, with an
emphasis on a novel attention mechanism, to automatically classify RV strain on
CTPA. Our method is a 3D DenseNet model with integrated 3D residual attention
blocks. We evaluated our model on a dataset of CTPAs of emergency department
(ED) PE patients. This model achieved an area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.88 for classifying RV strain. The model showed
a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 83.7%. Our solution outperforms
state-of-the-art 3D CNN networks. The proposed design allows for a fully
automated network that can be trained easily in an end-to-end manner without
requiring computationally intensive and time-consuming preprocessing or
strenuous labeling of the data.We infer that unmarked CTPAs can be used for
effective RV strain classification. This could be used as a second reader,
alerting for high-risk PE patients. To the best of our knowledge, there are no
previous deep learning-based studies that attempted to solve this problem.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the main challenges in autonomous robotic exploration and navigation
in unknown and unstructured environments is determining where the robot can or
cannot safely move. A significant source of difficulty in this determination
arises from stochasticity and uncertainty, coming from localization error,
sensor sparsity and noise, difficult-to-model robot-ground interactions, and
disturbances to the motion of the vehicle. Classical approaches to this problem
rely on geometric analysis of the surrounding terrain, which can be prone to
modeling errors and can be computationally expensive. Moreover, modeling the
distribution of uncertain traversability costs is a difficult task, compounded
by the various error sources mentioned above. In this work, we take a
principled learning approach to this problem. We introduce a neural network
architecture for robustly learning the distribution of traversability costs.
Because we are motivated by preserving the life of the robot, we tackle this
learning problem from the perspective of learning tail-risks, i.e. the
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We show that this approach reliably learns
the expected tail risk given a desired probability risk threshold between 0 and
1, producing a traversability costmap which is more robust to outliers, more
accurately captures tail risks, and is more computationally efficient, when
compared against baselines. We validate our method on data collected a legged
robot navigating challenging, unstructured environments including an abandoned
subway, limestone caves, and lava tube caves.]]></summary>

$\mathcal{P}$ be a causal model on a set $\mathbf{V}$ of observable variables

\mathbf{V}$, and setting ${\bf x}$ to $\mathbf{X}$, let $P_{\bf x}(\mathbf{Y})$
denote the interventional distribution on $\mathbf{Y}$ with respect to an
intervention ${\bf x}$ to variables ${\bf x}$. Shpitser and Pearl (AAAI 2006),
building on the work of Tian and Pearl (AAAI 2001), gave an exact
characterization of the class of causal graphs for which the interventional
distribution $P_{\bf x}({\mathbf{Y}})$ can be uniquely determined. We give the
first efficient version of the Shpitser-Pearl algorithm. In particular, under

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We consider finite-horizon restless bandits with multiple pulls per period,
which play an important role in recommender systems, active learning, revenue
management, and many other areas. While an optimal policy can be computed, in
principle, using dynamic programming, the computation required scales
exponentially in the number of arms $N$. Thus, there is substantial value in
understanding the performance of index policies and other policies that can be
computed efficiently for large $N$. We study the growth of the optimality gap,
i.e., the loss in expected performance compared to an optimal policy, for such
policies in a classical asymptotic regime proposed by Whittle in which $N$
grows while holding constant the fraction of arms that can be pulled per
period. Intuition from the Central Limit Theorem and the tightest previous
theoretical bounds suggest that this optimality gap should grow like
$O(\sqrt{N})$. Surprisingly, we show that it is possible to outperform this
bound. We characterize a non-degeneracy condition and a wide class of novel
practically-computable policies, called fluid-priority policies, in which the
optimality gap is $O(1)$. These include most widely-used index policies. When
this non-degeneracy condition does not hold, we show that fluid-priority
policies nevertheless have an optimality gap that is $O(\sqrt{N})$,
significantly generalizing the class of policies for which convergence rates
are known. We demonstrate that fluid-priority policies offer state-of-the-art
performance on a collection of restless bandit problems in numerical
experiments.]]></summary>

in sparse-reward settings. Imitation Learning (IL) can learn from expert
demonstrations without exploration, but it never exceeds the expert's
performance and is also vulnerable to distributional shift between
demonstration and execution. In this paper, we radically unify RL and IL based
on Free Energy Principle (FEP). FEP is a unified Bayesian theory of the brain
that explains perception, action and model learning by a common fundamental
principle. We present a theoretical extension of FEP and derive an algorithm in
which an agent learns the world model that internalizes expert demonstrations
and at the same time uses the model to infer the current and future states and
actions that maximize rewards. The algorithm thus reduces exploration costs by
partially imitating experts as well as maximizing its return in a seamless way,
resulting in a higher performance than the suboptimal expert. Our experimental
results show that this approach is promising in visual control tasks especially
in sparse-reward environments.]]></summary>

prediction, but missing data in clinical cohorts limits the number of subjects
in multi-modal learning context. Multi-modal missing imputation is challenging
with existing methods when 1) the missing data span across heterogeneous
modalities (e.g., image vs. non-image); or 2) one modality is largely missing.
In this paper, we address imputation of missing data by modeling the joint
distribution of multi-modal data. Motivated by partial bidirectional generative
adversarial net (PBiGAN), we propose a new Conditional PBiGAN (C-PBiGAN) method
that imputes one modality combining the conditional knowledge from another
modality. Specifically, C-PBiGAN introduces a conditional latent space in a
missing imputation framework that jointly encodes the available multi-modal
data, along with a class regularization loss on imputed data to recover
discriminative information. To our knowledge, it is the first generative
adversarial model that addresses multi-modal missing imputation by modeling the
joint distribution of image and non-image data. We validate our model with both
the national lung screening trial (NLST) dataset and an external clinical
validation cohort. The proposed C-PBiGAN achieves significant improvements in
lung cancer risk estimation compared with representative imputation methods
(e.g., AUC values increase in both NLST (+2.9\%) and in-house dataset (+4.3\%)
compared with PBiGAN, p$<$0.05).]]></summary>

measure does not correlate well with the energy consumption of hardware
equipped with massively parallel processing units like GPUs or TPUs. In this
article, we propose a simple refinement of the formula used to compute floating

application in safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS). One source of
uncertainty arises from distribution shifts in the input data between training
and test scenarios. Detecting such distribution shifts in real-time is an
emerging approach to address the challenge. The high dimensional input space in
CPS applications involving imaging adds extra difficulty to the task.
Generative learning models are widely adopted for the task, namely
out-of-distribution (OoD) detection. To improve the state-of-the-art, we
studied existing proposals from both machine learning and CPS fields. In the
latter, safety monitoring in real-time for autonomous driving agents has been a
focus. Exploiting the spatiotemporal correlation of motion in videos, we can
robustly detect hazardous motion around autonomous driving agents. Inspired by
the latest advances in the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) theory and practice,
we tapped into the prior knowledge in data to further boost OoD detection's
robustness. Comparison studies over nuScenes and Synthia data sets show our
methods significantly improve detection capabilities of OoD factors unique to
driving scenarios, 42% better than state-of-the-art approaches. Our model also
generalized near-perfectly, 97% better than the state-of-the-art across the
real-world and simulation driving data sets experimented. Finally, we
customized one proposed method into a twin-encoder model that can be deployed
to resource limited embedded devices for real-time OoD detection. Its execution
time was reduced over four times in low-precision 8-bit integer inference,
while detection capability is comparable to its corresponding floating-point
model.]]></summary>

promising results but are still on the lower side than other vision tasks (such

existing video captioning methods is that they are optimized over cross-entropy
loss function, which is uncorrelated to the de facto evaluation metrics (BLEU,
METEOR, CIDER, ROUGE).In other words, cross-entropy is not a proper surrogate
of the true loss function for video captioning. This paper addresses the
drawback by introducing a dynamic loss network (DLN), which provides an
additional feedback signal that directly reflects the evaluation metrics. Our

further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the transformer, there are
two trains of thought among existing works: (1) going wider by scaling to more
trainable parameters; (2) going shallower by parameter sharing or model
compressing along with the depth. However, larger models usually do not scale
well when fewer tokens are available to train, and advanced parallelisms are
required when the model is extremely large. Smaller models usually achieve
inferior performance compared to the original transformer model due to the loss
of representation power. In this paper, to achieve better performance with
fewer trainable parameters, we propose a framework to deploy trainable
parameters efficiently, by going wider instead of deeper. Specially, we scale
along model width by replacing feed-forward network (FFN) with
mixture-of-experts (MoE). We then share the MoE layers across transformer
blocks using individual layer normalization. Such deployment plays the role to
transform various semantic representations, which makes the model more
parameter-efficient and effective. To evaluate our framework, we design WideNet
and evaluate it on ImageNet-1K. Our best model outperforms Vision Transformer
(ViT) by $1.46\%$ with $0.72 \times$ trainable parameters. Using $0.46 \times$
and $0.13 \times$ parameters, our WideNet can still surpass ViT and ViT-MoE by
$0.83\%$ and $2.08\%$, respectively.]]></summary>

contemporary machine learning. This becomes even more difficult when considered
the context of big data that calls for dedicated architectures capable of
high-performance processing. Apache Spark is a highly efficient and popular
architecture, but it poses specific challenges for algorithms to be implemented
for it. While oversampling algorithms are an effective way for handling class
imbalance, they have not been designed for distributed environments. In this
paper, we propose a holistic look on oversampling algorithms for imbalanced big
data. We discuss the taxonomy of oversampling algorithms and their mechanisms
used to handle skewed class distributions. We introduce a Spark library with 14
state-of-the-art oversampling algorithms implemented and evaluate their
efficacy via extensive experimental study. Using binary and multi-class massive
data sets, we analyze the effectiveness of oversampling algorithms and their
relationships with different types of classifiers. We evaluate the trade-off
between accuracy and time complexity of oversampling algorithms, as well as
their scalability when increasing the size of data. This allows us to gain
insight into the usefulness of specific components of oversampling algorithms
for big data, as well as formulate guidelines and recommendations for designing
future resampling approaches for massive imbalanced data. Our library can be

recent years, but it is still challenging to enable VQA models to adaptively
generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Intuitively, recompositions of
existing visual concepts (i.e., attributes and objects) can generate unseen
compositions in the training set, which will promote VQA models to generalize
to OOD samples. In this paper, we formulate OOD generalization in VQA as a
compositional generalization problem and propose a graph generative
modeling-based training scheme (X-GGM) to handle the problem implicitly. X-GGM
leverages graph generative modeling to iteratively generate a relation matrix
and node representations for the predefined graph that utilizes
attribute-object pairs as nodes. Furthermore, to alleviate the unstable
training issue in graph generative modeling, we propose a gradient distribution
consistency loss to constrain the data distribution with adversarial
perturbations and the generated distribution. The baseline VQA model (LXMERT)
trained with the X-GGM scheme achieves state-of-the-art OOD performance on two
standard VQA OOD benchmarks, i.e., VQA-CP v2 and GQA-OOD. Extensive ablation

offline-policy learning algorithms are mostly based on inverse propensity score

many real-world systems do not guarantee such logging policies, especially when
the action space is large and many actions have poor or missing rewards. With
such \emph{support deficiency}, the offline learning fails to find optimal
policies. We propose a novel approach that uses a hybrid of offline learning

actions in the logged data whilst offline learning is used to exploit supported
actions from the logged data avoiding unnecessary explorations. Our approach
determines an optimal policy with theoretical guarantees using the minimal

recognition and classification tasks. However, fusing multiple modalities in

The model is composed of stacked auto encoders that harness the cross key-value

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Smart contract vulnerability detection draws extensive attention in recent
years due to the substantial losses caused by hacker attacks. Existing efforts
for contract security analysis heavily rely on rigid rules defined by experts,
which are labor-intensive and non-scalable. More importantly, expert-defined
rules tend to be error-prone and suffer the inherent risk of being cheated by
crafty attackers. Recent researches focus on the symbolic execution and formal
analysis of smart contracts for vulnerability detection, yet to achieve a
precise and scalable solution. Although several methods have been proposed to
detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, there is still a lack of effort that
considers combining expert-defined security patterns with deep neural networks.
In this paper, we explore using graph neural networks and expert knowledge for
smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we cast the rich control-
and data- flow semantics of the source code into a contract graph. To highlight
the critical nodes in the graph, we further design a node elimination phase to
normalize the graph. Then, we propose a novel temporal message propagation
network to extract the graph feature from the normalized graph, and combine the
graph feature with designed expert patterns to yield a final detection system.
Extensive experiments are conducted on all the smart contracts that have source
code in Ethereum and VNT Chain platforms. Empirical results show significant
accuracy improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on three types of
vulnerabilities, where the detection accuracy of our method reaches 89.15%,
89.02%, and 83.21% for reentrancy, timestamp dependence, and infinite loop
vulnerabilities, respectively.]]></summary>

critical concern. In this work, we propose a way to construct neural network
classifiers that dynamically repair violations of non-relational safety
constraints called safe ordering properties. Safe ordering properties relate
requirements on the ordering of a network's output indices to conditions on
their input, and are sufficient to express most useful notions of
non-relational safety for classifiers. Our approach is based on a novel
self-repairing layer, which provably yields safe outputs regardless of the
characteristics of its input. We compose this layer with an existing network to
construct a self-repairing network (SR-Net), and show that in addition to
providing safe outputs, the SR-Net is guaranteed to preserve the accuracy of
the original network. Notably, our approach is independent of the size and
architecture of the network being repaired, depending only on the specified
property and the dimension of the network's output; thus it is scalable to
large state-of-the-art networks. We show that our approach can be implemented
using vectorized computations that execute efficiently on a GPU, introducing
run-time overhead of less than one millisecond on current hardware -- even on

learned from one bridge to diagnose damage in another bridge without any labels
from the target bridge. Our framework trains a hierarchical neural network
model in an adversarial way to extract task-shared and task-specific features
that are informative to multiple diagnostic tasks and invariant across multiple
bridges. We evaluate our framework on experimental data collected from 2
bridges and 3 vehicles. We achieve accuracies of 95% for damage detection, 93%
for localization, and up to 72% for quantification, which are ~2 times
improvements from baseline methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Non-Euclidean geometry with constant negative curvature, i.e., hyperbolic
space, has attracted sustained attention in the community of machine learning.
Hyperbolic space, owing to its ability to embed hierarchical structures
continuously with low distortion, has been applied for learning data with
tree-like structures. Hyperbolic Neural Networks (HNNs) that operate directly
in hyperbolic space have also been proposed recently to further exploit the
potential of hyperbolic representations. While HNNs have achieved better
performance than Euclidean neural networks (ENNs) on datasets with implicit
hierarchical structure, they still perform poorly on standard classification
benchmarks such as CIFAR and ImageNet. The traditional wisdom is that it is
critical for the data to respect the hyperbolic geometry when applying HNNs. In
this paper, we first conduct an empirical study showing that the inferior
performance of HNNs on standard recognition datasets can be attributed to the
notorious vanishing gradient problem. We further discovered that this problem
stems from the hybrid architecture of HNNs. Our analysis leads to a simple yet
effective solution called Feature Clipping, which regularizes the hyperbolic
embedding whenever its norm exceeding a given threshold. Our thorough
experiments show that the proposed method can successfully avoid the vanishing
gradient problem when training HNNs with backpropagation. The improved HNNs are
able to achieve comparable performance with ENNs on standard image recognition
datasets including MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet, while demonstrating
more adversarial robustness and stronger out-of-distribution detection
capability.]]></summary>

automatically analyzes each layer to identify the optimal per-layer compression
ratio, while simultaneously achieving the desired overall compression. Our
algorithm hinges on the idea of compressing each convolutional (or

decomposing each group via low-rank decomposition. At the core of our algorithm
is the derivation of layer-wise error bounds from the Eckart Young Mirsky
theorem. We then leverage these bounds to frame the compression problem as an
optimization problem where we wish to minimize the maximum compression error
across layers and propose an efficient algorithm towards a solution. Our
experiments indicate that our method outperforms existing low-rank compression
approaches across a wide range of networks and data sets. We believe that our

for many fundamental applications, including augmented reality (AR) in retail,
AR-powered recruitment, and visual language navigation. With this goal in mind,
we propose PV-SOD, a new task that aims to segment salient objects from
panoramic videos. In contrast to existing fixation-level or object-level
saliency detection tasks, we focus on multi-modal salient object detection
(SOD), which mimics human attention mechanism by segmenting salient objects
with the guidance of audio-visual cues. To support this task, we collect the
first large-scale dataset, named ASOD60K, which contains 4K-resolution video
frames annotated with a six-level hierarchy, thus distinguishing itself with
richness, diversity and quality. Specifically, each sequence is marked with
both its super-/sub-class, with objects of each sub-class being further
annotated with human eye fixations, bounding boxes, object-/instance-level
masks, and associated attributes (e.g., geometrical distortion). These
coarse-to-fine annotations enable detailed analysis for PV-SOD modeling, e.g.,
determining the major challenges for existing SOD models, and predicting
scanpaths to study the long-term eye fixation behaviors of humans. We
systematically benchmark 11 representative approaches on ASOD60K and derive
several interesting findings. We hope this study could serve as a good starting
point for advancing SOD research towards panoramic videos.]]></summary>

practical classifiers. Instead, it is a useful sanity check to test whether
empirical detection results imply something much stronger than the authors

from the client Internet Protocol (IP) and node perspectives, therefore to
identify the denial of service (DoS) and cache pollution attack (CPA) patterns.
Experimental results are presented based on the analytics of eight days of
real-world CDN log data provided by a major CDN operator. Through experiments,
the abnormal contents, compromised nodes, malicious IPs, as well as their
corresponding attack types, are identified effectively by the proposed

That is, existing constructions either require sample complexity that grows

$d$. We present a novel algorithm that reduces the sample complexity to only
$\tilde{O}\left\{d{\cdot}\left(\log^*|X|\right)^{1.5}\right\}$, attaining a
dimensionality optimal dependency without requiring the sample complexity to
grow with $\log|X|$.The technique used in order to attain this improvement
involves the deletion of "exposed" data-points on the go, in a fashion designed

a prominent role in the field of computer vision. However, when targeting the
pixel-wise tasks like image fusion, it would not fully perceive the
particularity of each pixel in the image if the uniform convolution kernel is
used on different patches. In this paper, we propose a local adaptive
convolution (LAConv), which is dynamically adjusted to different spatial
locations. LAConv enables the network to pay attention to every specific local
area in the learning process. Besides, the dynamic bias (DYB) is introduced to
provide more possibilities for the depiction of features and make the network
more flexible. We further design a residual structure network equipped with the
proposed LAConv and DYB modules, and apply it to two image fusion tasks.
Experiments for pansharpening and hyperspectral image super-resolution (HISR)
demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art methods.

invariant properties, as well as point cloud used for pre-training can
sometimes lead to conflicts and necessitating the seek of the Pareto optimal
solution. In these situations, weighted norms commonly used to handle multiple

algorithms may scale poorly with increasing dimensionality. To overcome this

modify a gradient descent approach to handle the issue of conflicting
gradients. Numerical experiments are compared the benchmark boundary value

we comprehensively evaluate the robustness of existing UDA methods and propose

UDA methods in semantic segmentation remains unexplored, which pose a security
concern in this field; and (ii) although commonly used self-supervision (e.g.,
rotation and jigsaw) benefits image tasks such as classification and
recognition, they fail to provide the critical supervision signals that could
learn discriminative representation for segmentation tasks. These observations
motivate us to propose adversarial self-supervision UDA (or ASSUDA) that

retinal images, leading to ~164k different models. We analyze the performance
of these linear probes by source and target task and by layer depth. We observe
that representations from the middle layers of the network are more

restrictions on data availability. To still obtain viable models, continual
learning aims to train in sequential order, as and when data is available. The
main challenge that continual learning methods face is to prevent catastrophic
forgetting, i.e., a decrease in performance on the data encountered earlier.
This issue makes continuous training of segmentation models for medical
applications extremely difficult. Yet, often, data from at least two different
domains is available which we can exploit to train the model in a way that it
disregards domain-specific information. We propose an architecture that
leverages the simultaneous availability of two or more datasets to learn a
disentanglement between the content and domain in an adversarial fashion. The
domain-invariant content representation then lays the base for continual
semantic segmentation. Our approach takes inspiration from domain adaptation
and combines it with continual learning for hippocampal segmentation in brain
MRI. We showcase that our method reduces catastrophic forgetting and
outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Efficient, reliable and reproducible target volume delineation is a key step
in the effective planning of breast radiotherapy. However, post-operative
breast target delineation is challenging as the contrast between the tumor bed
volume (TBV) and normal breast tissue is relatively low in CT images. In this
study, we propose to mimic the marker-guidance procedure in manual target
delineation. We developed a saliency-based deep learning segmentation (SDL-Seg)
algorithm for accurate TBV segmentation in post-operative breast irradiation.
The SDL-Seg algorithm incorporates saliency information in the form of markers'
location cues into a U-Net model. The design forces the model to encode the
location-related features, which underscores regions with high saliency levels
and suppresses low saliency regions. The saliency maps were generated by
identifying markers on CT images. Markers' locations were then converted to
probability maps using a distance-transformation coupled with a Gaussian
filter. Subsequently, the CT images and the corresponding saliency maps formed
a multi-channel input for the SDL-Seg network. Our in-house dataset was
comprised of 145 prone CT images from 29 post-operative breast cancer patients,
who received 5-fraction partial breast irradiation (PBI) regimen on GammaPod.
The performance of the proposed method was compared against basic U-Net. Our
model achieved mean (standard deviation) of 76.4 %, 6.76 mm, and 1.9 mm for
DSC, HD95, and ASD respectively on the test set with computation time of below
11 seconds per one CT volume. SDL-Seg showed superior performance relative to
basic U-Net for all the evaluation metrics while preserving low computation
cost. The findings demonstrate that SDL-Seg is a promising approach for
improving the efficiency and accuracy of the on-line treatment planning
procedure of PBI, such as GammaPod based PBI.]]></summary>

distribution generator (or data generator) and a metric generator. In our
framework, we view the real data set as some manifold embedded in a
high-dimensional Euclidean space. The distribution generator aims at generating
samples that follow some distribution condensed around the real data manifold.
It is achieved by matching two sets of points using their geometric shape
descriptors, such as centroid and $p$-diameter, with learned distance metric;
the metric generator utilizes both real data and generated samples to learn a
distance metric which is close to some intrinsic geodesic distance on the real
data manifold. The produced distance metric is further used for manifold
matching. The two networks are learned simultaneously during the training
process. We apply the approach on both unsupervised and supervised learning
tasks: in unconditional image generation task, the proposed method obtains
competitive results compared with existing generative models; in
super-resolution task, we incorporate the framework in perception-based models
and improve visual qualities by producing samples with more natural textures.
Both theoretical analysis and real data experiments demonstrate the feasibility

deep learning-based image upsampling applications. State-of-the-art deep
learning solutions for image upsampling are currently trained using either
resize or sub-pixel convolution to learn kernels that generate high fidelity
images with minimal artifacts. However, performing inference with these learned
convolution kernels requires memory-intensive feature map transformations that
dominate time and energy costs in real-time applications. To alleviate this
pressure on memory bandwidth, we confine the use of resize or sub-pixel
convolution to training in the cloud by transforming learned convolution
kernels to deconvolution kernels before deploying them for inference as a
functionally equivalent deconvolution. These kernel transformations, intended
as a one-time cost when shifting from training to inference, enable a systems
designer to use each algorithm in their optimal context by preserving the image
fidelity learned when training in the cloud while minimizing data transfer
penalties during inference at the edge. We also explore existing variants of
deconvolution inference algorithms and introduce a novel variant for
consideration. We analyze and compare the inference properties of
convolution-based upsampling algorithms using a quantitative model of incurred
time and energy costs and show that using deconvolution for inference at the
edge improves both system latency and energy efficiency when compared to their
sub-pixel or resize convolution counterparts.]]></summary>

understanding how concentrations of trash from across the world's ocean and
identifying high concentration garbage hotspots in dire need of trash removal.
Currently, the most common monitoring method to quantify floating plastic
requires the use of a manta trawl. Techniques requiring manta trawls (or
similar surface collection devices) utilize physical removal of marine plastic
debris as the first step and then analyze collected samples as a second step.
The need for physical removal before analysis incurs high costs and requires
intensive labor preventing scalable deployment of a real-time marine plastic
monitoring service across the entirety of Earth's ocean bodies. Without better
monitoring and sampling methods, the total impact of plastic pollution on the
environment as a whole, and details of impact within specific oceanic regions,
will remain unknown. This study presents a highly scalable workflow that
utilizes images captured within the epipelagic layer of the ocean as an input.
It produces real-time quantification of marine plastic debris for accurate
quantification and physical removal. The workflow includes creating and
preprocessing a domain-specific dataset, building an object detection model
utilizing a deep neural network, and evaluating the model's performance.
YOLOv5-S was the best performing model, which operates at a Mean Average

source domain and an unsupervised loss in an unlabeled target domain, which
often faces more severe overfitting (than classical supervised learning) as the
supervised source loss has clear domain gap and the unsupervised target loss is
often noisy due to the lack of annotations. This paper presents RDA, a robust
domain adaptation technique that introduces adversarial attacking to mitigate
overfitting in UDA. We achieve robust domain adaptation by a novel Fourier
adversarial attacking (FAA) method that allows large magnitude of perturbation
noises but has minimal modification of image semantics, the former is critical
to the effectiveness of its generated adversarial samples due to the existence
of 'domain gaps'. Specifically, FAA decomposes images into multiple frequency
components (FCs) and generates adversarial samples by just perturbating certain
FCs that capture little semantic information. With FAA-generated samples, the
training can continue the 'random walk' and drift into an area with a flat loss
landscape, leading to more robust domain adaptation. Extensive experiments over
multiple domain adaptation tasks show that RDA can work with different computer

being non-invasive, unobtrusive, not requiring cooperation and being less

reliable human-computer interactive systems. However, annotations of large
scale datasets in FER has been a key challenge as these datasets suffer from
noise due to various factors like crowd sourcing, subjectivity of annotators,
poor quality of images, automatic labelling based on key word search etc. Such
noisy annotations impede the performance of FER due to the memorization ability
of deep networks. During early learning stage, deep networks fit on clean data.
Then, eventually, they start overfitting on noisy labels due to their
memorization ability, which limits FER performance. This report presents
Consensual Collaborative Training (CCT) framework used in our submission to
expression recognition track of the Affective Behaviour Analysis in-the-wild
(ABAW) 2021 competition. CCT co-trains three networks jointly using a convex
combination of supervision loss and consistency loss, without making any
assumption about the noise distribution. A dynamic transition mechanism is used
to move from supervision loss in early learning to consistency loss for
consensus of predictions among networks in the later stage. Co-training reduces
overall error, and consistency loss prevents overfitting to noisy samples. The
performance of the model is validated on challenging Aff-Wild2 dataset for
categorical expression classification. Our code is made publicly available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image inpainting aims to restore the missing regions and make the recovery
results identical to the originally complete image, which is different from the
common generative task emphasizing the naturalness of generated images.
Nevertheless, existing works usually regard it as a pure generation problem and
employ cutting-edge generative techniques to address it. The generative
networks fill the main missing parts with realistic contents but usually
distort the local structures. In this paper, we formulate image inpainting as a
mix of two problems, i.e., predictive filtering and deep generation. Predictive
filtering is good at preserving local structures and removing artifacts but
falls short to complete the large missing regions. The deep generative network
can fill the numerous missing pixels based on the understanding of the whole
scene but hardly restores the details identical to the original ones. To make
use of their respective advantages, we propose the joint predictive filtering
and generative network (JPGNet) that contains three branches: predictive
filtering & uncertainty network (PFUNet), deep generative network, and
uncertainty-aware fusion network (UAFNet). The PFUNet can adaptively predict
pixel-wise kernels for filtering-based inpainting according to the input image
and output an uncertainty map. This map indicates the pixels should be
processed by filtering or generative networks, which is further fed to the
UAFNet for a smart combination between filtering and generative results. Note
that, our method as a novel framework for the image inpainting problem can
benefit any existing generation-based methods. We validate our method on three
public datasets, i.e., Dunhuang, Places2, and CelebA, and demonstrate that our
method can enhance three state-of-the-art generative methods (i.e., StructFlow,
EdgeConnect, and RFRNet) significantly with the slightly extra time cost.]]></summary>

vision and graphics. The required smoothing properties can be different or even
contradictive among different tasks. Nevertheless, the inherent smoothing
nature of one smoothing operator is usually fixed and thus cannot meet the
various requirements of different applications. In this paper, we first
introduce the truncated Huber penalty function which shows strong flexibility
under different parameter settings. A generalized framework is then proposed
with the introduced truncated Huber penalty function. When combined with its
strong flexibility, our framework is able to achieve diverse smoothing natures
where contradictive smoothing behaviors can even be achieved. It can also yield
the smoothing behavior that can seldom be achieved by previous methods, and
superior performance is thus achieved in challenging cases. These together
enable our framework capable of a range of applications and able to outperform
the state-of-the-art approaches in several tasks, such as image detail
enhancement, clip-art compression artifacts removal, guided depth map
restoration, image texture removal, etc. In addition, an efficient numerical
solution is provided and its convergence is theoretically guaranteed even the
optimization framework is non-convex and non-smooth. A simple yet effective
approach is further proposed to reduce the computational cost of our method
while maintaining its performance. The effectiveness and superior performance
of our approach are validated through comprehensive experiments in a range of
applications. Our code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RGB-Infrared (IR) person re-identification aims to retrieve
person-of-interest from heterogeneous cameras, easily suffering from large
image modality discrepancy caused by different sensing wavelength ranges.
Existing work usually minimizes such discrepancy by aligning domain
distribution of global features, while neglecting the intra-modality structural
relations between semantic parts. This could result in the network overly
focusing on local cues, without considering long-range body part dependencies,
leading to meaningless region representations. In this paper, we propose a
graph-enabled distribution matching solution, dubbed Geometry-Guided
Dual-Alignment (G2DA) learning, for RGB-IR ReID. It can jointly encourage the
cross-modal consistency between part semantics and structural relations for
fine-grained modality alignment by solving a graph matching task within a
multi-scale skeleton graph that embeds human topology information.
Specifically, we propose to build a semantic-aligned complete graph into which
all cross-modality images can be mapped via a pose-adaptive graph construction
mechanism. This graph represents extracted whole-part features by nodes and
expresses the node-wise similarities with associated edges. To achieve the
graph-based dual-alignment learning, an Optimal Transport (OT) based structured
metric is further introduced to simultaneously measure point-wise relations and
group-wise structural similarities across modalities. By minimizing the cost of
an inter-modality transport plan, G2DA can learn a consistent and
discriminative feature subspace for cross-modality image retrieval.
Furthermore, we advance a Message Fusion Attention (MFA) mechanism to
adaptively reweight the information flow of semantic propagation, effectively
strengthening the discriminability of extracted semantic features.]]></summary>

to train the attention weights, which drastically boosts the video matting
performance. Besides, we show how to effectively solve the trimap generation

camera from the captured image alone. Typically, a convolutional backbone with
a multi-layer perceptron head is trained with images and pose labels to embed a
single reference scene at a time. Recently, this scheme was extended for
learning multiple scenes by replacing the MLP head with a set of fully
connected layers. In this work, we propose to learn multi-scene absolute camera
pose regression with Transformers, where encoders are used to aggregate
activation maps with self-attention and decoders transform latent features and
scenes encoding into candidate pose predictions. This mechanism allows our
model to focus on general features that are informative for localization while
embedding multiple scenes in parallel. We evaluate our method on commonly
benchmarked indoor and outdoor datasets and show that it surpasses both

target location by following natural language instructions. Most of existing
works represent a navigation candidate by the feature of the corresponding
single view where the candidate lies in. However, an instruction may mention
landmarks out of the single view as references, which might lead to failures of
textual-visual matching of existing methods. In this work, we propose a
multi-module Neighbor-View Enhanced Model (NvEM) to adaptively incorporate
visual contexts from neighbor views for better textual-visual matching.
Specifically, our NvEM utilizes a subject module and a reference module to
collect contexts from neighbor views. The subject module fuses neighbor views
at a global level, and the reference module fuses neighbor objects at a local
level. Subjects and references are adaptively determined via attention
me'chanisms. Our model also includes an action module to utilize the strong
orientation guidance (e.g., "turn left") in instructions. Each module predicts
navigation action separately and their weighted sum is used for predicting the
final action. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method on the R2R and R4R benchmarks against several
state-of-the-art navigators, and NvEM even beats some pre-training ones. Our

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modern top-performing object detectors depend heavily on backbone networks,
whose advances bring consistent performance gains through exploring more
effective network structures. In this paper, we propose a novel and flexible
backbone framework, namely CBNetV2, to construct high-performance detectors
using existing open-sourced pre-trained backbones under the pre-training
fine-tuning paradigm. In particular, CBNetV2 architecture groups multiple
identical backbones, which are connected through composite connections.
Specifically, it integrates the high- and low-level features of multiple
backbone networks and gradually expands the receptive field to more efficiently
perform object detection. We also propose a better training strategy with
assistant supervision for CBNet-based detectors. Without additional
pre-training of the composite backbone, CBNetV2 can be adapted to various
backbones (CNN-based vs. Transformer-based) and head designs of most mainstream
detectors (one-stage vs. two-stage, anchor-based vs. anchor-free-based).
Experiments provide strong evidence that, compared with simply increasing the
depth and width of the network, CBNetV2 introduces a more efficient, effective,
and resource-friendly way to build high-performance backbone networks.
Particularly, our Dual-Swin-L achieves 59.4% box AP and 51.6% mask AP on COCO
test-dev under the single-model and single-scale testing protocol, which is
significantly better than the state-of-the-art result (57.7% box AP and 50.2%
mask AP) achieved by Swin-L, while the training schedule is reduced by
6$\times$. With multi-scale testing, we push the current best single model
result to a new record of 60.1% box AP and 52.3% mask AP without using extra
training data. Code is available at https://github.com/VDIGPKU/CBNetV2.]]></summary>

advances, CNN-based approaches typically apply filters in a spatially invariant

the pixel gradient statistics and guides the model towards spatially-variant
filters that enhance noise removal, prevent over-smoothing and preserve
detailed structures for different regions in CT imaging. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach achieved superior performance on both synthetic

based on a novel sparsity-inducing optimization framework. This method is
derived from the multiple observations, that is, semi-sparsity prior knowledge
is more universally applicable, especially in areas where sparsity is not fully
admitted, such as polynomial-smoothing surfaces. We illustrate that this
semi-sparsity can be identified into a generalized $L_0$-norm minimization in
higher-order gradient domains, thereby giving rise to a new "feature-aware"
filtering method with a powerful simultaneous-fitting ability in both sparse
features (singularities and sharpening edges) and non-sparse regions
(polynomial-smoothing surfaces). Notice that a direct solver is always
unavailable due to the non-convexity and combinatorial nature of $L_0$-norm
minimization. Instead, we solve the model based on an efficient half-quadratic
splitting minimization with fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) for acceleration. We
finally demonstrate its versatility and many benefits to a series of
signal/image processing and computer vision applications.]]></summary>

training on large-scale annotated datasets, which is not viable in many
situations. In this paper we present GAN-DL, a Discriminator Learner based on
the StyleGAN2 architecture, which we employ for self-supervised image
representation learning in the case of fluorescent biological images. We show
that Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks combined with linear Support
Vector Machines enable high-throughput compound screening based on raw images.
We demonstrate this by classifying active and inactive compounds tested for the
inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in VERO and HRCE cell lines. In contrast to
previous methods, our deep learning based approach does not require any
annotation besides the one that is normally collected during the sample
preparation process. We test our technique on the RxRx19a Sars-CoV-2 image
collection. The dataset consists of fluorescent images that were generated to
assess the ability of regulatory-approved or in late-stage clinical trials
compound to modulate the in vitro infection from SARS-CoV-2 in both VERO and
HRCE cell lines. We show that our technique can be exploited not only for
classification tasks, but also to effectively derive a dose response curve for
the tested treatments, in a self-supervised manner. Lastly, we demonstrate its
generalization capabilities by successfully addressing a zero-shot learning
task, consisting in the categorization of four different cell types of the
RxRx1 fluorescent images collection.]]></summary>

decision processes. Both the reward functions and the state transition
functions are allowed to vary arbitrarily over time as long as their cumulative
variations do not exceed certain variation budgets. We propose Restarted
Q-Learning with Upper Confidence Bounds (RestartQ-UCB), the first model-free
algorithm for non-stationary RL, and show that it outperforms existing
solutions in terms of dynamic regret. Specifically, RestartQ-UCB with
Freedman-type bonus terms achieves a dynamic regret bound of
$\widetilde{O}(S^{\frac{1}{3}} A^{\frac{1}{3}} \Delta^{\frac{1}{3}} H
T^{\frac{2}{3}})$, where $S$ and $A$ are the numbers of states and actions,
respectively, $\Delta>0$ is the variation budget, $H$ is the number of time
steps per episode, and $T$ is the total number of time steps. We further
present a parameter-free algorithm named Double-Restart Q-UCB that does not
require prior knowledge of the variation budget. We show that our algorithms
are \emph{nearly optimal} by establishing an information-theoretical lower
bound of $\Omega(S^{\frac{1}{3}} A^{\frac{1}{3}} \Delta^{\frac{1}{3}}
H^{\frac{2}{3}} T^{\frac{2}{3}})$, the first lower bound in non-stationary RL.
Numerical experiments validate the advantages of RestartQ-UCB in terms of both
cumulative rewards and computational efficiency. We demonstrate the power of
our results in examples of multi-agent RL and inventory control across related

appropriate trade-off. In this work we place a point process prior on the
inducing points and approximate the associated posterior through stochastic
variational inference. By letting the prior encourage a moderate number of

presents the first algorithm with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\kappa_{\mathbf

as variants of natural gradient descent (Amari, 1998), offer the prospect of
yielding more effective descent directions. For models with many parameters,
the covariance matrix they are based on becomes gigantic, making them
inapplicable in their original form. This has motivated research into both
simple diagonal approximations and more sophisticated factored approximations
such as KFAC (Heskes, 2000; Martens & Grosse, 2015; Grosse & Martens, 2016). In
the present work we draw inspiration from both to propose a novel approximation
that is provably better than KFAC and amendable to cheap partial updates. It
consists in tracking a diagonal variance, not in parameter coordinates, but in
a Kronecker-factored eigenbasis, in which the diagonal approximation is likely
to be more effective. Experiments show improvements over KFAC in optimization
speed for several deep network architectures.]]></summary>

learning, that one can a-priori use to scale any embedding technique. Our
local2global approach proceeds by first dividing the input graph into
overlapping subgraphs (or "patches") and training local representations for
each patch independently. In a second step, we combine the local
representations into a globally consistent representation by estimating the set
of rigid motions that best align the local representations using information
from the patch overlaps, via group synchronization. A key distinguishing
feature of local2global relative to existing work is that patches are trained
independently without the need for the often costly parameter synchronisation
during distributed training. This allows local2global to scale to large-scale
industrial applications, where the input graph may not even fit into memory and
may be stored in a distributed manner. Preliminary results on medium-scale data
sets (up to $\sim$7K nodes and $\sim$200K edges) are promising, with a graph
reconstruction performance for local2global that is comparable to that of
globally trained embeddings. A thorough evaluation of local2global on large
scale data and applications to downstream tasks, such as node classification
and link prediction, constitutes ongoing work.]]></summary>

Haralick features and further segmenting the characters using artificial neural
networks. The image is divided into kernels, each of which is converted to a
GLCM (Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix) on which a Haralick Feature generation
function is called, the result of which is an array with fourteen elements
corresponding to fourteen features The Haralick values and the corresponding
noise/text classification form a dictionary, which is then used to de-noise the
image through kernel comparison. Segmentation is the process of extracting
characters from a document and can be used when letters are separated by white
space, which is an explicit boundary marker. Segmentation is the first step in
many Natural Language Processing problems. This paper explores the process of
segmentation using Neural Networks. While there have been numerous methods to
segment characters of a document, this paper is only concerned with the
accuracy of doing so using neural networks. It is imperative that the
characters be segmented correctly, for failing to do so will lead to incorrect
recognition by Natural language processing tools. Artificial Neural Networks
was used to attain accuracy of upto 89%. This method is suitable for languages
where the characters are delimited by white space. However, this method will
fail to provide acceptable results when the language heavily uses connected
letters. An example would be the Devanagari script, which is predominantly used

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning-based models are developed to automatically detect if a retina
image is `referable' in diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening. However, their
classification accuracy degrades as the input images distributionally shift
from their training distribution. Further, even if the input is not a retina
image, a standard DR classifier produces a high confident prediction that the
image is `referable'. Our paper presents a Dirichlet Prior Network-based
framework to address this issue. It utilizes an out-of-distribution (OOD)
detector model and a DR classification model to improve generalizability by
identifying OOD images. Experiments on real-world datasets indicate that the
proposed framework can eliminate the unknown non-retina images and identify the
distributionally shifted retina images for human intervention.]]></summary>

national authorities. Restrictions found in these regulations may include
limits on times of activities, the overall number of noise events, as well as
limits on number of events depending on the class of noise or activity. A noise
monitoring system may be used to track overall sound levels, but rarely provide
the ability to detect activity or count the number of events, required to
compare directly with such regulations. This work investigates the feasibility
and performance of an automatic detection system to count noise events. An
empirical evaluation was done by collecting data at a newly constructed
shooting range and training facility. The data includes tests of multiple
weapon configurations from small firearms to high caliber rifles and
explosives, at multiple source positions, and collected on multiple different
days. Several alternative machine learning models are tested, using as inputs
time-series of standard acoustic indicators such as A-weighted sound levels and
1/3 octave spectrogram, and classifiers such as Logistic Regression and
Convolutional Neural Networks. Performance for the various alternatives are
reported in terms of the False Positive Rate and False Negative Rate. The
detection performance was found to be satisfactory for use in automatic logging
of time-periods with training activity.]]></summary>

distributed training and data privacy protection, it still encounters many
obstacles. One of these is the naturally existing statistical heterogeneity
among clients, making local data distributions non independently and
identically distributed (i.e., non-iid), which poses challenges for model
aggregation and personalization. For FL with a deep neural network (DNN),
privatizing some layers is a simple yet effective solution for non-iid
problems. However, which layers should we privatize to facilitate the learning
process? Do different categories of non-iid scenes have preferred privatization
ways? Can we automatically learn the most appropriate privatization way during
FL? In this paper, we answer these questions via abundant experimental studies
on several FL benchmarks. First, we present the detailed statistics of these
benchmarks and categorize them into covariate and label shift non-iid scenes.
Then, we investigate both coarse-grained and fine-grained network splits and
explore whether the preferred privatization ways have any potential relations
to the specific category of a non-iid scene. Our findings are exciting, e.g.,
privatizing the base layers could boost the performances even in label shift
non-iid scenes, which are inconsistent with some natural conjectures. We also
find that none of these privatization ways could improve the performances on
the Shakespeare benchmark, and we guess that Shakespeare may not be a seriously
non-iid scene. Finally, we propose several approaches to automatically learn
where to aggregate via cross-stitch, soft attention, and hard selection. We
advocate the proposed methods could serve as a preliminary try to explore where
to privatize for a novel non-iid scene.]]></summary>

speech waveforms by conditioning on videos of an individual's face. Using a
generative adversarial network (GAN) with linguistic and speaker characteristic
features as auxiliary conditions, our method directly converts face images into
speech waveforms under an end-to-end training framework. The linguistic
features are extracted from lip movements using a lip-reading model, and the
speaker characteristic features are predicted from face images using
cross-modal learning with a pre-trained acoustic model. Since these two
features are uncorrelated and controlled independently, we can flexibly
synthesize speech waveforms whose speaker characteristics vary depending on the
input face images. Therefore, our method can be regarded as a multi-speaker
face-to-speech waveform model. We show the superiority of our proposed model
over conventional methods in terms of both objective and subjective evaluation
results. Specifically, we evaluate the performances of the linguistic feature
and the speaker characteristic generation modules by measuring the accuracy of
automatic speech recognition and automatic speaker/gender recognition tasks,

a broad wavelength range and system compactness, which are difficult to achieve
by conventional imaging sensors. However, a common challenge is low image
quality arising from undersampling. Deep learning (DL) is an emerging and
powerful tool in computational imaging for many applications and researchers
have applied DL in SPI to achieve higher image quality than conventional
reconstruction approaches. One outstanding challenge, however, is that the
accuracy of DL predictions in SPI cannot be assessed in practical applications
where the ground truths are unknown. Here, we propose the use of the Bayesian
convolutional neural network (BCNN) to approximate the uncertainty (coming from
finite training data and network model) of the DL predictions in SPI. Each
pixel in the predicted result from BCNN represents the parameter of a
probability distribution rather than the image intensity value. Then, the
uncertainty can be approximated with BCNN by minimizing a negative
log-likelihood loss function in the training stage and Monte Carlo dropout in
the prediction stage. The results show that the BCNN can reliably approximate
the uncertainty of the DL predictions in SPI with varying compression ratios
and noise levels. The predicted uncertainty from BCNN in SPI reveals that most
of the reconstruction errors in deep-learning-based SPI come from the edges of
the image features. The results show that the proposed BCNN can provide a
reliable tool to approximate the uncertainty of DL predictions in SPI and can
be widely used in many applications of SPI.]]></summary>

conform to the expected normal instances. In this paper, the Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) based on encoder-decoder-encoder pipeline are used
for detection and achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, deep neural
networks are too over-parameterized to deploy on resource-limited devices.
Therefore, Progressive Knowledge Distillation with GANs (PKDGAN) is proposed to
learn compact and fast novelty detection networks. The P-KDGAN is a novel
attempt to connect two standard GANs by the designed distillation loss for
transferring knowledge from the teacher to the student. The progressive
learning of knowledge distillation is a two-step approach that continuously
improves the performance of the student GAN and achieves better performance
than single step methods. In the first step, the student GAN learns the basic
knowledge totally from the teacher via guiding of the pretrained teacher GAN
with fixed weights. In the second step, joint fine-training is adopted for the
knowledgeable teacher and student GANs to further improve the performance and
stability. The experimental results on CIFAR-10, MNIST, and FMNIST show that
our method improves the performance of the student GAN by 2.44%, 1.77%, and
1.73% when compressing the computation at ratios of 24.45:1, 311.11:1, and

privacy-preserving collaborative model training via frequent learning-updates
exchange between edge devices and server. Due to the constrained bandwidth,
only a subset of devices can upload their updates at each communication round.
This has led to an active research area in FEEL studying the optimal device
scheduling policy for minimizing communication time. However, owing to the
difficulty in quantifying the exact communication time, prior work in this area
can only tackle the problem partially by considering either the communication
rounds or per-round latency, while the total communication time is determined
by both metrics. To close this gap, we make the first attempt in this paper to
formulate and solve the communication time minimization problem. We first
derive a tight bound to approximate the communication time through
cross-disciplinary effort involving both learning theory for convergence
analysis and communication theory for per-round latency analysis. Building on
the analytical result, an optimized probabilistic scheduling policy is derived
in closed-form by solving the approximate communication time minimization
problem. It is found that the optimized policy gradually turns its priority
from suppressing the remaining communication rounds to reducing per-round
latency as the training process evolves. The effectiveness of the proposed
scheme is demonstrated via a use case on collaborative 3D objective detection
in autonomous driving.]]></summary>

such as node classification, link prediction, and node clustering. However,
GNNs gain their performance benefits mainly from performing the feature
propagation and smoothing across the edges of the graph, thus requiring
sufficient connectivity and label information for effective propagation.
Unfortunately, many real-world networks are sparse in terms of both edges and
labels, leading to sub-optimal performance of GNNs. Recent interest in this
sparse problem has focused on the self-training approach, which expands
supervised signals with pseudo labels. Nevertheless, the self-training approach
inherently cannot realize the full potential of refining the learning
performance on sparse graphs due to the unsatisfactory quality and quantity of
pseudo labels.

In this paper, we propose ROD, a novel reception-aware online knowledge
distillation approach for sparse graph learning. We design three supervision
signals for ROD: multi-scale reception-aware graph knowledge, task-based
supervision, and rich distilled knowledge, allowing online knowledge transfer
in a peer-teaching manner. To extract knowledge concealed in the multi-scale
reception fields, ROD explicitly requires individual student models to preserve
different levels of locality information. For a given task, each student would
predict based on its reception-scale knowledge, while simultaneously a strong
teacher is established on-the-fly by combining multi-scale knowledge. Our
approach has been extensively evaluated on 9 datasets and a variety of
graph-based tasks, including node classification, link prediction, and node
clustering. The result demonstrates that ROD achieves state-of-art performance
and is more robust for the graph sparsity.]]></summary>

used for unsupervised anomaly detection, where current techniques have
limitations such as the accurate detection of anomalies near the tail of a
distribution. GANs generally do not guarantee the existence of a probability
density and are susceptible to mode collapse, while few GANs use likelihood to
reduce mode collapse. In this paper, we create a GAN-based tail formation model
for anomaly detection, the Tail of distribution GAN (TailGAN), to generate
samples on the tail of the data distribution and detect anomalies near the
support boundary. Using TailGAN, we leverage GANs for anomaly detection and use
maximum entropy regularization. Using GANs that learn the probability of the
underlying distribution has advantages in improving the anomaly detection
methodology by allowing us to devise a generator for boundary samples, and use
this model to characterize anomalies. TailGAN addresses supports with disjoint
components and achieves competitive performance on images. We evaluate TailGAN
for identifying Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data and its performance evaluated on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, Baggage X-Ray, and OoD data shows competitiveness compared to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Natural convection in porous media is a highly nonlinear multiphysical
problem relevant to many engineering applications (e.g., the process of
$\mathrm{CO_2}$ sequestration). Here, we present a non-intrusive reduced order
model of natural convection in porous media employing deep convolutional
autoencoders for the compression and reconstruction and either radial basis
function (RBF) interpolation or artificial neural networks (ANNs) for mapping
parameters of partial differential equations (PDEs) on the corresponding
nonlinear manifolds. To benchmark our approach, we also describe linear
compression and reconstruction processes relying on proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD) and ANNs. We present comprehensive comparisons among
different models through three benchmark problems. The reduced order models,
linear and nonlinear approaches, are much faster than the finite element model,
obtaining a maximum speed-up of $7 \times 10^{6}$ because our framework is not
bound by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition; hence, it could deliver
quantities of interest at any given time contrary to the finite element model.
Our model's accuracy still lies within a mean squared error of 0.07 (two-order
of magnitude lower than the maximum value of the finite element results) in the
worst-case scenario. We illustrate that, in specific settings, the nonlinear
approach outperforms its linear counterpart and vice versa. We hypothesize that
a visual comparison between principal component analysis (PCA) or t-Distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) could indicate which method will perform
better prior to employing any specific compression strategy.]]></summary>

machine-learning methods as statistical emulators for use in the analysis of
agent-based models (ABMs). Analysing ABM outputs can be challenging, as the
relationships between input parameters can be non-linear or even chaotic even
in relatively simple models, and each model run can require significant CPU
time. Statistical emulation, in which a statistical model of the ABM is
constructed to facilitate detailed model analyses, has been proposed as an
alternative to computationally costly Monte Carlo methods. Here we compare
multiple machine-learning methods for ABM emulation in order to determine the
approaches best suited to emulating the complex behaviour of ABMs. Our results
suggest that, in most scenarios, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and
gradient-boosted trees outperform Gaussian process emulators, currently the
most commonly used method for the emulation of complex computational models.
ANNs produced the most accurate model replications in scenarios with high
numbers of model runs, although training times were longer than the other
methods. We propose that agent-based modelling would benefit from using
machine-learning methods for emulation, as this can facilitate more robust
sensitivity analyses for the models while also reducing CPU time consumption
when calibrating and analysing the simulation.]]></summary>

speech waveforms by conditioning on videos of an individual's face. Using a
generative adversarial network (GAN) with linguistic and speaker characteristic
features as auxiliary conditions, our method directly converts face images into
speech waveforms under an end-to-end training framework. The linguistic
features are extracted from lip movements using a lip-reading model, and the
speaker characteristic features are predicted from face images using
cross-modal learning with a pre-trained acoustic model. Since these two
features are uncorrelated and controlled independently, we can flexibly
synthesize speech waveforms whose speaker characteristics vary depending on the
input face images. Therefore, our method can be regarded as a multi-speaker
face-to-speech waveform model. We show the superiority of our proposed model
over conventional methods in terms of both objective and subjective evaluation
results. Specifically, we evaluate the performances of the linguistic feature
and the speaker characteristic generation modules by measuring the accuracy of
automatic speech recognition and automatic speaker/gender recognition tasks,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we study the problem of fair worker selection in Federated
Learning systems, where fairness serves as an incentive mechanism that
encourages more workers to participate in the federation. Considering the
achieved training accuracy of the global model as the utility of the selected
workers, which is typically a monotone submodular function, we formulate the
worker selection problem as a new multi-round monotone submodular maximization
problem with cardinality and fairness constraints. The objective is to maximize
the time-average utility over multiple rounds subject to an additional fairness
requirement that each worker must be selected for a certain fraction of time.
While the traditional submodular maximization with a cardinality constraint is
already a well-known NP-Hard problem, the fairness constraint in the
multi-round setting adds an extra layer of difficulty. To address this novel
challenge, we propose three algorithms: Fair Continuous Greedy (FairCG1 and
FairCG2) and Fair Discrete Greedy (FairDG), all of which satisfy the fairness
requirement whenever feasible. Moreover, we prove nontrivial lower bounds on
the achieved time-average utility under FairCG1 and FairCG2. In addition, by
giving a higher priority to fairness, FairDG ensures a stronger short-term
fairness guarantee, which holds in every round. Finally, we perform extensive
simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of
the time-average utility and fairness satisfaction.]]></summary>

Egyptian vehicles license plates. Two systems are based on character
recognition, which are (System1, Characters Recognition with Classical Machine

other two systems are based on the whole plate recognition which are (System3,

Whole License Plate Recognition with Deep Machine Learning). We use object
detection algorithms, and machine learning based object recognition algorithms.
The performance of the developed systems has been tested on real images, and
the experimental results demonstrate that the best detection accuracy rate for
VLP is provided by using the deep learning method. Where the VLP detection
accuracy rate is better than the classical system by 32%. However, the best
detection accuracy rate for Vehicle License Plate Arabic Character (VLPAC) is
provided by using the classical method. Where VLPAC detection accuracy rate is
better than the deep learning-based system by 6%. Also, the results show that

quantization, the mixed precision technique is incorporated in our framework by
approximating the inter-layer and intra-layer sensitivity. Extensive

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For machine agents to successfully interact with humans in real-world
settings, they will need to develop an understanding of human mental life.
Intuitive psychology, the ability to reason about hidden mental variables that
drive observable actions, comes naturally to people: even pre-verbal infants
can tell agents from objects, expecting agents to act efficiently to achieve
goals given constraints. Despite recent interest in machine agents that reason
about other agents, it is not clear if such agents learn or hold the core
psychology principles that drive human reasoning. Inspired by cognitive
development studies on intuitive psychology, we present a benchmark consisting
of a large dataset of procedurally generated 3D animations, AGENT (Action,
Goal, Efficiency, coNstraint, uTility), structured around four scenarios (goal
preferences, action efficiency, unobserved constraints, and cost-reward
trade-offs) that probe key concepts of core intuitive psychology. We validate
AGENT with human-ratings, propose an evaluation protocol emphasizing
generalization, and compare two strong baselines built on Bayesian inverse
planning and a Theory of Mind neural network. Our results suggest that to pass
the designed tests of core intuitive psychology at human levels, a model must
acquire or have built-in representations of how agents plan, combining utility
computations and core knowledge of objects and physics.]]></summary>

the task of discriminating top quark-initiated jets from those originating from
the hadronization of a light quark or a gluon. The end-to-end deep learning

representation of the high-energy collision event. In this study, we use
low-level detector information from the simulated CMS Open Data samples to
construct the top jet classifiers. To optimize classifier performance we
progressively add low-level information from the CMS tracking detector,
including pixel detector reconstructed hits and impact parameters, and
demonstrate the value of additional tracking information even when no new
spatial structures are added. Relying only on calorimeter energy deposits and
reconstructed pixel detector hits, the end-to-end classifier achieves an AUC
score of 0.975$\pm$0.002 for the task of classifying boosted top quark jets.
After adding derived track quantities, the classifier AUC score increases to
0.9824$\pm$0.0013, serving as the first performance benchmark for these CMS
Open Data samples. We additionally provide a timing performance comparison of
different processor unit architectures for training the network.]]></summary>

vision applications. It aims at providing different IDs to different objects of
the scene, even if they belong to the same class. Instance segmentation is
usually performed as a two-stage pipeline. First, an object is detected, then
semantic segmentation within the detected box area is performed which involves
costly up-sampling. In this paper, we propose Insta-YOLO, a novel one-stage
end-to-end deep learning model for real-time instance segmentation. Instead of
pixel-wise prediction, our model predicts instances as object contours
represented by 2D points in Cartesian space. We evaluate our model on three
datasets, namely, Carvana,Cityscapes and Airbus. We compare our results to the
state-of-the-art models for instance segmentation. The results show our model

non-linear and non-convex machine learning problems such as the training of
deep neural networks. However, previous works on SGD often rely on highly
restrictive and unrealistic assumptions about the nature of noise in SGD. In
this work, we mathematically construct examples that defy previous
understandings of SGD. For example, our constructions show that: (1) SGD may
converge to a local maximum; (2) SGD may escape a saddle point arbitrarily
slowly; (3) SGD may prefer sharp minima over the flat ones; and (4) AMSGrad may

module that enforces the segmentation network to yield similar pixel-level

achieve this, we maintain a memory bank continuously updated with relevant and
high-quality feature vectors from labeled data. In an end-to-end training, the
features from both labeled and unlabeled data are optimized to be similar to
same-class samples from the memory bank. Our approach outperforms the current
state-of-the-art for semi-supervised semantic segmentation and semi-supervised
domain adaptation on well-known public benchmarks, with larger improvements on
the most challenging scenarios, i.e., less available labeled data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While CNN-based models have made remarkable progress on human pose
estimation, what spatial dependencies they capture to localize keypoints
remains unclear. In this work, we propose a model called \textbf{TransPose},
which introduces Transformer for human pose estimation. The attention layers
built in Transformer enable our model to capture long-range relationships
efficiently and also can reveal what dependencies the predicted keypoints rely
on. To predict keypoint heatmaps, the last attention layer specially acts as an
aggregator, which collects contributions from image clues and forms maximum
positions of keypoints. Such a heatmap-based localization approach via
Transformer conforms to the principle of Activation Maximization
\cite{erhan2009visualizing}. And the revealed dependencies are image-specific
and fine-grained, which also can provide evidence of how the model handles
special cases, e.g., occlusion. The experiments show that TransPose achieves
75.8 AP and 75.0 AP on COCO validation and test-dev sets with 256 $\times$ 192
input resolution, while being more lightweight and faster than mainstream CNN
architectures. The TransPose model also transfers very well on MPII benchmark,
yielding 93.9\% accuracy on test set when fine-tuned with small training costs.

the FB layer suffers from the quadratic number of coefficients, overfitting and
the spurious correlations due to correlations between channels of hidden
representations that violate the i.i.d. assumption. Thus, we propose a compact
FB layer by defining a family of summarizing operators applied over the

Outdoor LiDAR point clouds are typically large-scale and complexly distributed,
which makes the registration challenging. In this paper, we propose an

point cloud registration. Instead of using all points in the point clouds,
HRegNet performs registration on hierarchically extracted keypoints and

robust and precise registration. We present a correspondence network to
generate correct and accurate keypoints correspondences. Moreover, bilateral
consensus and neighborhood consensus are introduced for keypoints matching and
novel similarity features are designed to incorporate them into the
correspondence network, which significantly improves the registration
performance. Besides, the whole network is also highly efficient since only a
small number of keypoints are used for registration. Extensive experiments are
conducted on two large-scale outdoor LiDAR point cloud datasets to demonstrate

as window reflections, fence occlusions, or adherent raindrops, from a short
sequence of images captured by a moving camera. Our method leverages motion
differences between the background and obstructing elements to recover both

of the two layers and reconstructing each layer from the flow-warped images via
a deep convolutional neural network. This learning-based layer reconstruction
module facilitates accommodating potential errors in the flow estimation and

image is `referable' in diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening. However, their
classification accuracy degrades as the input images distributionally shift

image, a standard DR classifier produces a high confident prediction that the

monitoring the face quality in pre-processing or predicting the data

category of losses that learn a universal feature embedding whose magnitude can

that the magnitude of the feature embedding monotonically increases if the
subject is more likely to be recognized. In addition, MagFace introduces an
adaptive mechanism to learn a wellstructured within-class feature distributions
by pulling easy samples to class centers while pushing hard samples away. This
prevents models from overfitting on noisy low-quality samples and improves face
recognition in the wild. Extensive experiments conducted on face recognition,

vision and has drawn an increasing amount of research interest in the past
decade. This paper provides the first comprehensive review and benchmark for
light field SOD, which has long been lacking in the saliency community.
Firstly, we introduce preliminary knowledge on light fields, including theory
and data forms, and then review existing studies on light field SOD, covering
ten traditional models, seven deep learning-based models, one comparative
study, and one brief review. Existing datasets for light field SOD are also
summarized with detailed information and statistical analyses. Secondly, we
benchmark nine representative light field SOD models together with several
cutting-edge RGB-D SOD models on four widely used light field datasets, from
which insightful discussions and analyses, including a comparison between light
field SOD and RGB-D SOD models, are achieved. Besides, due to the inconsistency
of datasets in their current forms, we further generate complete data and
supplement focal stacks, depth maps and multi-view images for the inconsistent
datasets, making them consistent and unified. Our supplemental data makes a
universal benchmark possible. Lastly, because light field SOD is quite a
special problem attributed to its diverse data representations and high
dependency on acquisition hardware, making it differ greatly from other
saliency detection tasks, we provide nine hints into the challenges and future
directions, and outline several open issues. We hope our review and
benchmarking could help advance research in this field. All the materials
including collected models, datasets, benchmarking results, and supplemented
light field datasets will be publicly available on our project site

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most recent semantic segmentation methods adopt a fully-convolutional network
(FCN) with an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder progressively reduces
the spatial resolution and learns more abstract/semantic visual concepts with
larger receptive fields. Since context modeling is critical for segmentation,
the latest efforts have been focused on increasing the receptive field, through
either dilated/atrous convolutions or inserting attention modules. However, the
encoder-decoder based FCN architecture remains unchanged. In this paper, we aim
to provide an alternative perspective by treating semantic segmentation as a
sequence-to-sequence prediction task. Specifically, we deploy a pure
transformer (ie, without convolution and resolution reduction) to encode an
image as a sequence of patches. With the global context modeled in every layer
of the transformer, this encoder can be combined with a simple decoder to
provide a powerful segmentation model, termed SEgmentation TRansformer (SETR).
Extensive experiments show that SETR achieves new state of the art on ADE20K
(50.28% mIoU), Pascal Context (55.83% mIoU) and competitive results on
Cityscapes. Particularly, we achieve the first position in the highly
competitive ADE20K test server leaderboard on the day of submission.]]></summary>

by users, the generated results are expected to have adequate diversities in
appearance while maintaining correct and reasonable structures in original
images. Such tasks become more challenging if only limited data is available.
Recently proposed generative models complete training based on only one image.
They pay much attention to the monolithic feature of the sample while ignoring
the actual semantic information of different objects inside the sample. As a
result, for ROI-based generation tasks, they may produce inappropriate samples
with excessive randomicity and without maintaining the related objects' correct
structures. To address this issue, this work introduces a
MOrphologic-structure-aware Generative Adversarial Network named MOGAN that
produces random samples with diverse appearances and reliable structures based
on only one image. For training for ROI, we propose to utilize the data coming
from the original image being augmented and bring in a novel module to
transform such augmented data into knowledge containing both structures and
appearances, thus enhancing the model's comprehension of the sample. To learn
the rest areas other than ROI, we employ binary masks to ensure the generation
isolated from ROI. Finally, we set parallel and hierarchical branches of the
mentioned learning process. Compared with other single image GAN schemes, our
approach focuses on internal features including the maintenance of rational
structures and variation on appearance. Experiments confirm a better capacity
of our model on ROI-based image generation tasks than its competitive peers.]]></summary>

the unknown depths for the remaining image pixels. Most methods model this as
depth interpolation and erroneously interpolate depth pixels into the empty
space between spatially distinct objects, resulting in depth-smearing across
occlusion boundaries. Here we propose a multi-hypothesis depth representation
that explicitly models both foreground and background depths in the difficult
occlusion-boundary regions. Our method can be thought of as performing
twin-surface extrapolation, rather than interpolation, in these regions. Next
our method fuses these extrapolated surfaces into a single depth image
leveraging the image data. Key to our method is the use of an asymmetric loss
function that operates on a novel twin-surface representation. This enables us
to train a network to simultaneously do surface extrapolation and surface
fusion. We characterize our loss function and compare with other common losses.
Finally, we validate our method on three different datasets; KITTI, an outdoor
real-world dataset, NYU2, indoor real-world depth dataset and Virtual KITTI, a
photo-realistic synthetic dataset with dense groundtruth, and demonstrate
improvement over the state of the art.]]></summary>

as an initialization for model fine-tuning. The fine-tuning is required because
the limited data present in smaller datasets is not adequate for action
recognition models to learn complex spatio-temporal features. Because the
clients present are often heterogeneous in their computing resources, we use an
asynchronous federated optimization and we further show a convergence bound. We
compare our approach to two baseline approaches: fine-tuning at the central
server (no clients) and fine-tuning using (heterogeneous) clients using
synchronous federated averaging. We empirically show on a testbed of

VFS surpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised approaches for both OTB visual

deep neural networks (DNNs) into making wrong predictions. Enhancing the
adversarial robustness of DNNs has gained considerable interest in recent
years. Although image transformation-based defenses were widely considered at
an earlier time, most of them have been defeated by adaptive attacks. In this
paper, we propose a new image transformation defense based on error diffusion
halftoning, and combine it with adversarial training to defend against
adversarial examples. Error diffusion halftoning projects an image into a 1-bit
space and diffuses quantization error to neighboring pixels. This process can
remove adversarial perturbations from a given image while maintaining
acceptable image quality in the meantime in favor of recognition. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to improve adversarial
robustness even under advanced adaptive attacks, while most of the other image
transformation-based defenses do not. We show that a proper image
transformation can still be an effective defense approach. Code:

a great loss all over the world, socially and economically. Due to the
false-negative rate and the time-consuming of the conventional Reverse
Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests, diagnosing based on
X-ray images and Computed Tomography (CT) images has been widely adopted.
Therefore, researchers of the computer vision area have developed many
automatic diagnosing models based on machine learning or deep learning to
assist the radiologists and improve the diagnosing accuracy. In this paper, we
present a review of these recently emerging automatic diagnosing models. 70
models proposed from February 14, 2020, to July 21, 2020, are involved. We
analyzed the models from the perspective of preprocessing, feature extraction,
classification, and evaluation. Based on the limitation of existing models, we
pointed out that domain adaption in transfer learning and interpretability
promotion would be the possible future directions.]]></summary>

instrument segmentation. However, the high computation cost may limit the
application of deep models to time-sensitive tasks such as online surgical
video analysis for robotic-assisted surgery. Moreover, current methods may
still suffer from challenging conditions in surgical images such as various
lighting conditions and the presence of blood. We propose a novel Multi-frame
Feature Aggregation (MFFA) module to aggregate video frame features temporally
and spatially in a recurrent mode. By distributing the computation load of deep
feature extraction over sequential frames, we can use a lightweight encoder to
reduce the computation costs at each time step. Moreover, public surgical
videos usually are not labeled frame by frame, so we develop a method that can
randomly synthesize a surgical frame sequence from a single labeled frame to
assist network training. We demonstrate that our approach achieves superior
performance to corresponding deeper segmentation models on two public surgery

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Micro-bubbles and bubbly flows are widely observed and applied in chemical
engineering, medicine, involves deformation, rupture, and collision of bubbles,
phase mixture, etc. We study bubble dynamics by setting up two numerical
simulation cases: bubbly flow with a single bubble and multiple bubbles, both
confined in the microchannel, with parameters corresponding to their medical
backgrounds. Both the cases have their medical background applications.
Multiphase flow simulation requires high computation accuracy due to possible
component losses that may be caused by sparse meshing during the computation.
Hence, data-driven methods can be adopted as an useful tool. Based on
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), we propose a novel deep learning
framework BubbleNet, which entails three main parts: deep neural networks (DNN)
with sub nets for predicting different physics fields; the
semi-physics-informed part, with only the fluid continuum condition and the
pressure Poisson equation $\mathcal{P}$ encoded within; the time discretized
normalizer (TDN), an algorithm to normalize field data per time step before
training. We apply the traditional DNN and our BubbleNet to train the coarsened
simulation data and predict the physics fields of both the two bubbly flow
cases. The BubbleNets are trained for both with and without $\mathcal{P}$, from
which we conclude that the 'physics-informed' part can serve as inner
supervision. Results indicate our framework can predict the physics fields more
accurately, estimating the prediction absolute errors. Our deep learning
predictions outperform traditional numerical methods computed with similar data
density meshing. The proposed network can potentially be applied to many other
engineering fields.]]></summary>

Convolutional Neural Networks (G-CNNs). In this framework, a network layer is
seen as a set of PDE-solvers where geometrically meaningful PDE-coefficients
become the layer's trainable weights. Formulating our PDEs on homogeneous
spaces allows these networks to be designed with built-in symmetries such as
rotation in addition to the standard translation equivariance of CNNs.

Having all the desired symmetries included in the design obviates the need to
include them by means of costly techniques such as data augmentation. We will
discuss our PDE-based G-CNNs (PDE-G-CNNs) in a general homogeneous space
setting while also going into the specifics of our primary case of interest:
roto-translation equivariance.

We solve the PDE of interest by a combination of linear group convolutions
and non-linear morphological group convolutions with analytic kernel
approximations that we underpin with formal theorems. Our kernel approximations
allow for fast GPU-implementation of the PDE-solvers, we release our
implementation with this article. Just like for linear convolution a
morphological convolution is specified by a kernel that we train in our
PDE-G-CNNs. In PDE-G-CNNs we do not use non-linearities such as max/min-pooling
and ReLUs as they are already subsumed by morphological convolutions.

We present a set of experiments to demonstrate the strength of the proposed
PDE-G-CNNs in increasing the performance of deep learning based imaging
applications with far fewer parameters than traditional CNNs.]]></summary>

major practical barrier to data sharing in medical research. However, in many
cases, researchers have no interest in a particular individual's information
but rather aim to derive insights at the level of cohorts. Here, we utilize
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create derived medical imaging
datasets consisting entirely of synthetic patient data. The synthetic images
ideally have, in aggregate, similar statistical properties to those of a source
dataset but do not contain sensitive personal information. We assess the
quality of synthetic data generated by two GAN models for chest radiographs
with 14 different radiology findings and brain computed tomography (CT) scans
with six types of intracranial hemorrhages. We measure the synthetic image
quality by the performance difference of predictive models trained on either
the synthetic or the real dataset. We find that synthetic data performance
disproportionately benefits from a reduced number of unique label combinations.
Our open-source benchmark also indicates that at low number of samples per
class, label overfitting effects start to dominate GAN training. We
additionally conducted a reader study in which trained radiologists do not
perform better than random on discriminating between synthetic and real medical
images for intermediate levels of resolutions. In accordance with our benchmark
results, the classification accuracy of radiologists increases at higher
spatial resolution levels. Our study offers valuable guidelines and outlines
practical conditions under which insights derived from synthetic medical images
are similar to those that would have been derived from real imaging data. Our
results indicate that synthetic data sharing may be an attractive and
privacy-preserving alternative to sharing real patient-level data in the right
settings.]]></summary>

independent data source or a complement. The robustness of skeleton-based
activity recognizers has been questioned recently, which shows that they are
vulnerable to adversarial attacks when the full-knowledge of the recognizer is
accessible to the attacker. However, this white-box requirement is overly
restrictive in most scenarios and the attack is not truly threatening. In this
paper, we show that such threats do exist under black-box settings too. To this
end, we propose the first black-box adversarial attack method BASAR. Through
BASAR, we show that adversarial attack is not only truly a threat but also can
be extremely deceitful, because on-manifold adversarial samples are rather
common in skeletal motions, in contrast to the common belief that adversarial
samples only exist off-manifold. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison,
we show that BASAR can deliver successful attacks across models, data, and
attack modes. Through harsh perceptual studies, we show that it achieves
effective yet imperceptible attacks. By analyzing the attack on different
activity recognizers, BASAR helps identify the potential causes of their
vulnerability and provides insights on what classifiers are likely to be more
robust against attack. Code is available at

mixing to efficiently combine the merits of both single and multiscale methods.
We show that an efficient multiscale method can be devised without the need for
denoising detail subbands which substantially reduces the runtime. The proposed
methods are initially derived within the framework of sparsifying transform
learning denoising, and then, they are generalized to propose our multiscale
extensions for the well-known K-SVD and SAIST image denoising methods. We
analyze and assess the studied methods thoroughly and compare them with the
well-known and state-of-the-art methods. The experiments show that our methods

boast an impressive capability in modeling long sequences, the latter allow
users to willingly exert control over different parts (e.g., bars) of the music
to be generated. In this paper, we are interested in bringing the two together
to construct a single model that exhibits both strengths. The task is split
into two steps. First, we equip Transformer decoders with the ability to accept
segment-level, time-varying conditions during sequence generation.
Subsequently, we combine the developed and tested in-attention decoder with a
Transformer encoder, and train the resulting MuseMorphose model with the VAE
objective to achieve style transfer of long musical pieces, in which users can
specify musical attributes including rhythmic intensity and polyphony (i.e.,
harmonic fullness) they desire, down to the bar level. Experiments show that
MuseMorphose outperforms recurrent neural network (RNN) based baselines on

in learning theory. In this paper, we investigate the excess risk performance
and towards improved learning rates for two popular approaches of stochastic
optimization: empirical risk minimization (ERM) and stochastic gradient descent

for supervised learning, current theoretical understandings of ERM and SGD
either have stronger assumptions in convex learning, e.g., strong convexity, or
show slow rates and less studied in nonconvex learning. Motivated by these
problems, we aim to provide improved rates under milder assumptions in convex
learning and derive faster rates in nonconvex learning. It is notable that our
analysis span two popular theoretical viewpoints: \emph{stability} and
\emph{uniform convergence}. Specifically, in stability regime, we present high
probability learning rates of order $\mathcal{O} (1/n)$ w.r.t. the sample size
$n$ for ERM and SGD with milder assumptions in convex learning and similar high
probability rates of order $\mathcal{O} (1/n)$ in nonconvex learning, rather
than in expectation. Furthermore, this type of learning rate is improved to
faster order $\mathcal{O} (1/n^2)$ in uniform convergence regime. To our best

requires a small subset of training data but produces less powerful quantized
models than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT). In this work, we propose a novel
PTQ framework, dubbed BRECQ, which pushes the limits of bitwidth in PTQ down to
INT2 for the first time. BRECQ leverages the basic building blocks in neural
networks and reconstructs them one-by-one. In a comprehensive theoretical study
of the second-order error, we show that BRECQ achieves a good balance between
cross-layer dependency and generalization error. To further employ the power of
quantization, the mixed precision technique is incorporated in our framework by
approximating the inter-layer and intra-layer sensitivity. Extensive
experiments on various handcrafted and searched neural architectures are
conducted for both image classification and object detection tasks. And for the
first time we prove that, without bells and whistles, PTQ can attain 4-bit

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep ensembles have recently gained popularity in the deep learning community
for their conceptual simplicity and efficiency. However, maintaining functional
diversity between ensemble members that are independently trained with gradient
descent is challenging. This can lead to pathologies when adding more ensemble
members, such as a saturation of the ensemble performance, which converges to
the performance of a single model. Moreover, this does not only affect the
quality of its predictions, but even more so the uncertainty estimates of the
ensemble, and thus its performance on out-of-distribution data. We hypothesize
that this limitation can be overcome by discouraging different ensemble members
from collapsing to the same function. To this end, we introduce a kernelized
repulsive term in the update rule of the deep ensembles. We show that this
simple modification not only enforces and maintains diversity among the members
but, even more importantly, transforms the maximum a posteriori inference into
proper Bayesian inference. Namely, we show that the training dynamics of our
proposed repulsive ensembles follow a Wasserstein gradient flow of the KL
divergence with the true posterior. We study repulsive terms in weight and
function space and empirically compare their performance to standard ensembles
and Bayesian baselines on synthetic and real-world prediction tasks.]]></summary>

theory and then introduced into the optimization community. BLO is able to
handle problems with a hierarchical structure, involving two levels of
optimization tasks, where one task is nested inside the other. In machine
learning and computer vision fields, despite the different motivations and
mechanisms, a lot of complex problems, such as hyper-parameter optimization,
multi-task and meta-learning, neural architecture search, adversarial learning
and deep reinforcement learning, actually all contain a series of closely
related subproblms. In this paper, we first uniformly express these complex
learning and vision problems from the perspective of BLO. Then we construct a
best-response-based single-level reformulation and establish a unified
algorithmic framework to understand and formulate mainstream gradient-based BLO
methodologies, covering aspects ranging from fundamental automatic
differentiation schemes to various accelerations, simplifications, extensions
and their convergence and complexity properties. Last but not least, we discuss
the potentials of our unified BLO framework for designing new algorithms and
point out some promising directions for future research.]]></summary>

navigation in unstructured environments. However, real-time constraints
frequently limit the accuracy of online tests especially in scenarios where
realistic robot-terrain interactions are complex to model. In this context, we
propose a deep learning framework trained in an end-to-end fashion from
elevation maps and trajectories to estimate the occurrence of failure events.
The network is first trained and tested in simulation over synthetic maps
generated by the OpenSimplex algorithm. The prediction performance of the Deep
Learning framework is illustrated by being able to retain over 94% recall of
the original simulator at 30% of the computational time. Finally, the network
is transferred and tested on real elevation maps collected by the SEEKER
consortium during the Martian rover test trial in the Atacama desert in Chile.
We show that transferring and fine-tuning of an application-independent
pre-trained model retains better performance than training uniquely on scarcely
available real data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper concentrates on the approximation power of deep feed-forward
neural networks in terms of width and depth. It is proved by construction that
ReLU networks with width $\mathcal{O}\big(\max\{d\lfloor N^{1/d}\rfloor,\,
N+2\}\big)$ and depth $\mathcal{O}(L)$ can approximate a H\"older continuous
function on $[0,1]^d$ with an approximation rate
$\mathcal{O}\big(\lambda\sqrt{d} (N^2L^2\ln N)^{-\alpha/d}\big)$, where
$\alpha\in (0,1]$ and $\lambda>0$ are H\"older order and constant,
respectively. Such a rate is optimal up to a constant in terms of width and
depth separately, while existing results are only nearly optimal without the
logarithmic factor in the approximation rate. More generally, for an arbitrary
continuous function $f$ on $[0,1]^d$, the approximation rate becomes
$\mathcal{O}\big(\,\sqrt{d}\,\omega_f\big( (N^2L^2\ln N)^{-1/d}\big)\,\big)$,
where $\omega_f(\cdot)$ is the modulus of continuity. We also extend our
analysis to any continuous function $f$ on a bounded set. Particularly, if ReLU
networks with depth $31$ and width $\mathcal{O}(N)$ are used to approximate
one-dimensional Lipschitz continuous functions on $[0,1]$ with a Lipschitz
constant $\lambda>0$, the approximation rate in terms of the total number of
parameters, $W=\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, becomes $\mathcal{O}(\tfrac{\lambda}{W\ln
W})$, which has not been discovered in the literature for fixed-depth ReLU
networks.]]></summary>

field, with applications ranging from telemonitoring of people at risk, to
using sensor derived information as objective endpoints in clinical trials. To
fully utilize sensor information, signals from distinct sensors often have to
be temporally aligned. However, due to imperfect oscillators and significant
noise, commonly encountered with biomedical signals, temporal alignment of raw
signals is an all but trivial problem, with, to-date, no generally applicable
solution. In this work, we present Deep Canonical Correlation Alignment (DCCA),
a novel, generally applicable solution for the temporal alignment of raw
(biomedical) sensor signals. DCCA allows practitioners to directly align raw
signals, from distinct sensors, without requiring deep domain knowledge. On a
selection of artificial and real datasets, we demonstrate the performance and
utility of DCCA under a variety of conditions. We compare the DCCA algorithm to
other warping based methods, DCCA outperforms dynamic time warping and cross
correlation based methods by an order of magnitude in terms of alignment error.
DCCA performs especially well on almost periodic biomedical signals such as
heart-beats and breathing patterns. In comparison to existing approaches, that
are not tailored towards raw sensor data, DCCA is not only fast enough to work
on signals with billions of data points but also provides automatic filtering
and transformation functionalities, allowing it to deal with very noisy and
even morphologically distinct signals.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning in deep neural networks (DNNs) is implemented through minimizing a
highly non-convex loss function, typically by a stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) method. This learning process can effectively find good wide minima
without being trapped in poor local ones. We present a novel account of how
such effective deep learning emerges through the interactions of the SGD and
the geometrical structure of the loss landscape. Rather than being a normal
diffusion process (i.e. Brownian motion) as often assumed, we find that the SGD
exhibits rich, complex dynamics when navigating through the loss landscape;
initially, the SGD exhibits anomalous superdiffusion, which attenuates
gradually and changes to subdiffusion at long times when the solution is
reached. Such learning dynamics happen ubiquitously in different DNNs such as
ResNet and VGG-like networks and are insensitive to batch size and learning
rate. The anomalous superdiffusion process during the initial learning phase
indicates that the motion of SGD along the loss landscape possesses
intermittent, big jumps; this non-equilibrium property enables the SGD to
escape from sharp local minima. By adapting the methods developed for studying
energy landscapes in complex physical systems, we find that such superdiffusive
learning dynamics are due to the interactions of the SGD and the fractal-like
structure of the loss landscape. We further develop a simple model to
demonstrate the mechanistic role of the fractal loss landscape in enabling the
SGD to effectively find global minima. Our results thus reveal the
effectiveness of deep learning from a novel perspective and have implications
for designing efficient deep neural networks.]]></summary>

are acquired by the same sensor. However, in many real-life scenarios, e.g.,
natural disaster, it is more practical to use the latest available images
before and after the occurrence of incidence, which may be acquired using
different sensors. In particular, we are interested in the combination of the
images acquired by optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. SAR
images appear vastly different from the optical images even when capturing the
same scene. Adding to this, change detection methods are often constrained to
use only target image-pair, no labeled data, and no additional unlabeled data.
Such constraints limit the scope of traditional supervised machine learning and
unsupervised generative approaches for multi-sensor change detection. Recent
rapid development of self-supervised learning methods has shown that some of
them can even work with only few images. Motivated by this, in this work we
propose a method for multi-sensor change detection using only the unlabeled
target bi-temporal images that are used for training a network in
self-supervised fashion by using deep clustering and contrastive learning. The
proposed method is evaluated on four multi-modal bi-temporal scenes showing
change and the benefits of our self-supervised approach are demonstrated.]]></summary>

theory and then introduced into the optimization community. BLO is able to
handle problems with a hierarchical structure, involving two levels of
optimization tasks, where one task is nested inside the other. In machine
learning and computer vision fields, despite the different motivations and
mechanisms, a lot of complex problems, such as hyper-parameter optimization,
multi-task and meta-learning, neural architecture search, adversarial learning
and deep reinforcement learning, actually all contain a series of closely
related subproblms. In this paper, we first uniformly express these complex
learning and vision problems from the perspective of BLO. Then we construct a
best-response-based single-level reformulation and establish a unified
algorithmic framework to understand and formulate mainstream gradient-based BLO
methodologies, covering aspects ranging from fundamental automatic
differentiation schemes to various accelerations, simplifications, extensions
and their convergence and complexity properties. Last but not least, we discuss
the potentials of our unified BLO framework for designing new algorithms and
point out some promising directions for future research.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most 3D neural networks are trained from scratch owing to the lack of
large-scale labeled datasets. In this paper, we present a novel 3D pretraining
method by leveraging 2D networks learned from rich 2D datasets. We propose the
contrastive pixel-to-point knowledge transfer to effectively utilize the 2D
information by mapping the pixel-level and point-level features into the same
embedding space. Due to the heterogeneous nature between 2D and 3D networks, we
introduce the back-projection function to align the features between 2D and 3D
to make the transfer possible. Additionally, we devise an upsampling feature
projection layer to increase the spatial resolution of high-level 2D feature
maps, which helps learning fine-grained 3D representations. With a pretrained
2D network, the proposed pretraining process requires no additional 2D or 3D
labeled data, further alleviating the expansive 3D data annotation cost. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to exploit existing 2D trained weights
to pretrain 3D deep neural networks. Our intensive experiments show that the 3D
models pretrained with 2D knowledge boost the performances across various
real-world 3D downstream tasks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One-class novelty detection is to identify anomalous instances that do not
conform to the expected normal instances. In this paper, the Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) based on encoder-decoder-encoder pipeline are used
for detection and achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, deep neural
networks are too over-parameterized to deploy on resource-limited devices.
Therefore, Progressive Knowledge Distillation with GANs (PKDGAN) is proposed to
learn compact and fast novelty detection networks. The P-KDGAN is a novel
attempt to connect two standard GANs by the designed distillation loss for
transferring knowledge from the teacher to the student. The progressive
learning of knowledge distillation is a two-step approach that continuously
improves the performance of the student GAN and achieves better performance
than single step methods. In the first step, the student GAN learns the basic
knowledge totally from the teacher via guiding of the pretrained teacher GAN
with fixed weights. In the second step, joint fine-training is adopted for the
knowledgeable teacher and student GANs to further improve the performance and
stability. The experimental results on CIFAR-10, MNIST, and FMNIST show that
our method improves the performance of the student GAN by 2.44%, 1.77%, and
1.73% when compressing the computation at ratios of 24.45:1, 311.11:1, and
700:1, respectively.]]></summary>

for which the key is to bridge the gap between sketches and photos in terms of
the data representation. Inspired by channel-wise attention explored in recent

seamlessly incorporates the prior knowledge of sample sketch or photo into SE
module and make the SE module capable of emphasizing appropriate channels
according to domain signal. Accordingly, the proposed network can switch its
mode to achieve a better domain feature with lower intra-class discrepancy.
Moreover, while previous works simply focus on minimizing intra-class distance
and maximizing inter-class distance, we introduce a loss function, named
Multiplicative Euclidean Margin Softmax (MEMS), which introduces multiplicative
Euclidean margin into feature space and ensure that the maximum intra-class
distance is smaller than the minimum inter-class distance. This facilitates
learning a highly discriminative feature space and ensures a more accurate
image retrieval result. Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely used
SBIR benchmark datasets. Our approach achieves better results on both datasets,

were made over the years to fight this phenomenon, with various degrees of
success. In this work we aim to break the unholy connection between bit-rate

pre-editing the incoming image and modifying its content to fit the given bits.
We design this editing operation as a learned convolutional neural network, and
formulate an optimization problem for its training. Our loss takes into account
a proximity between the original image and the edited one, a bit-budget penalty
over the proposed image, and a no-reference image quality measure for forcing
the outcome to be visually pleasing. The proposed approach is demonstrated on
the popular JPEG compression, showing savings in bits and/or improvements in

the car. Hand gestures and speech are already being applied for driver-car
interaction. Moreover, multimodal approaches are also showing promise in the
automotive industry. In this paper, we utilize deep learning for a multimodal
fusion network for referencing objects outside the vehicle. We use features
from gaze, head pose and finger pointing simultaneously to precisely predict
the referenced objects in different car poses. We demonstrate the practical
limitations of each modality when used for a natural form of referencing,
specifically inside the car. As evident from our results, we overcome the
modality specific limitations, to a large extent, by the addition of other
modalities. This work highlights the importance of multimodal sensing,
especially when moving towards natural user interaction. Furthermore, our user
based analysis shows noteworthy differences in recognition of user behavior
depending upon the vehicle pose.]]></summary>

images of incredible realism. One concern raised is whether the
state-of-the-art GAN's learned distribution still suffers from mode collapse,
and what to do if so. Existing diversity tests of samples from GANs are usually
conducted qualitatively on a small scale, and/or depends on the access to
original training data as well as the trained model parameters. This paper
explores to diagnose GAN intra-mode collapse and calibrate that, in a novel
black-box setting: no access to training data, nor the trained model
parameters, is assumed. The new setting is practically demanded, yet rarely
explored and significantly more challenging. As a first stab, we devise a set
of statistical tools based on sampling, that can visualize, quantify, and
rectify intra-mode collapse. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
diagnosis and calibration techniques, via extensive simulations and
experiments, on unconditional GAN image generation (e.g., face and vehicle).
Our study reveals that the intra-mode collapse is still a prevailing problem in
state-of-the-art GANs and the mode collapse is diagnosable and calibratable in
black-box settings. Our codes are available at:

right-away. Instead, they start with an intuitive decision, reflect upon it,
spot mistakes, resolve contradictions and jump between different hypotheses.
Thus, they create a sequence of ideas and follow a train of thought that
ultimately reaches a conclusive decision. Contrary to this, today's neural
classification models are mostly trained to map an input to one single and
fixed output. In this paper, we investigate how we can give models the
opportunity of a second, third and $k$-th thought. We take inspiration from
Hegel's dialectics and propose a method that turns an existing classifier's
class prediction (such as the image class forest) into a sequence of
predictions (such as forest $\rightarrow$ tree $\rightarrow$ mushroom).
Concretely, we propose a correction module that is trained to estimate the
model's correctness as well as an iterative prediction update based on the
prediction's gradient. Our approach results in a dynamic system over class
probability distributions $\unicode{x2014}$ the thought flow. We evaluate our
method on diverse datasets and tasks from computer vision and natural language
processing. We observe surprisingly complex but intuitive behavior and
demonstrate that our method (i) can correct misclassifications, (ii)
strengthens model performance, (iii) is robust to high levels of adversarial
attacks, (iv) can increase accuracy up to 4% in a label-distribution-shift
setting and (iv) provides a tool for model interpretability that uncovers model
knowledge which otherwise remains invisible in a single distribution
prediction.]]></summary>

HO pose, but also pays attention to the contact due to their interaction.
Significant progress has been made in estimating hand and object separately
with deep learning methods, simultaneous HO pose estimation and contact
modeling has not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we present an explicit
contact representation namely Contact Potential Field (CPF), and a
learning-fitting hybrid framework namely MIHO to Modeling the Interaction of
Hand and Object. In CPF, we treat each contacting HO vertex pair as a
spring-mass system. Hence the whole system forms a potential field with minimal
elastic energy at the grasp position. Extensive experiments on the two commonly
used benchmarks have demonstrated that our method can achieve state-of-the-art
in several reconstruction metrics, and allow us to produce more physically
plausible HO pose even when the ground-truth exhibits severe interpenetration

changes in image style, image blurriness, geographic location, camera

the test. We find that using larger models and artificial data augmentations
can improve robustness on real-world distribution shifts, contrary to claims in
prior work. We find improvements in artificial robustness benchmarks can
transfer to real-world distribution shifts, contrary to claims in prior work.
Motivated by our observation that data augmentations can help with real-world
distribution shifts, we also introduce a new data augmentation method which
advances the state-of-the-art and outperforms models pretrained with 1000 times
more labeled data. Overall we find that some methods consistently help with
distribution shifts in texture and local image statistics, but these methods do
not help with some other distribution shifts like geographic changes. Our
results show that future research must study multiple distribution shifts

narrow range depth sensing applications. The key obstacle in composing
light-fields from exposures taken by a plenoptic camera is to computationally
calibrate, align and rearrange four-dimensional image data. Several attempts
have been proposed to enhance the overall image quality by tailoring pipelines
dedicated to particular plenoptic cameras and improving the consistency across
viewpoints at the expense of high computational loads. The framework presented
herein advances prior outcomes thanks to its novel micro image scale-space
analysis for generic camera calibration independent of the lens specifications
and its parallax-invariant, cost-effective viewpoint color equalization from
optimal transport theory. Artifacts from the sensor and micro lens grid are
compensated in an innovative way to enable superior quality in sub-aperture
image extraction, computational refocusing and Scheimpflug rendering with
sub-sampling capabilities. Benchmark comparisons using established image
metrics suggest that our proposed pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art tool
chains in the majority of cases. Results from a Wasserstein distance further
show that our color transfer outdoes the existing transport methods. Our
algorithms are released under an open-source license, offer cross-platform
compatibility with few dependencies and different user interfaces. This makes
the reproduction of results and experimentation with plenoptic camera
technology convenient for peer researchers, developers, photographers, data
scientists and others working in this field.]]></summary>

fundamental research to some artificial intelligent applications, where
solutions alternate with challenges. Transfer learning and multi-task learning
techniques have been leveraged to mitigate the supervision sparsity and
collaborate multiple heterogeneous domains correspondingly. Recent years, the
sensitive nature of users' private data raises another challenge for sentiment
classification, i.e., data privacy protection. In this paper, we resort to
federated learning for multiple domain sentiment classification under the
constraint that the corpora must be stored on decentralized devices. In view of
the heterogeneous semantics across multiple parties and the peculiarities of
word embedding, we pertinently provide corresponding solutions. First, we
propose a Knowledge Transfer Enhanced Private-Shared (KTEPS) framework for
better model aggregation and personalization in federated sentiment
classification. Second, we propose KTEPS$^\star$ with the consideration of the
rich semantic and huge embedding size properties of word vectors, utilizing
Projection-based Dimension Reduction (PDR) methods for privacy protection and
efficient transmission simultaneously. We propose two federated sentiment
classification scenes based on public benchmarks, and verify the superiorities
of our proposed methods with abundant experimental investigations.]]></summary>

therefore bear the risk of losing edge details and introducing background
pixels. Impeded by the inherent noise, existing coarse annotations are only
taken as a bonus for model pre-training. In this paper, we try to exploit their
potentials with a confidence-based reweighting strategy. To expand, loss-based
reweighting strategies usually take the high loss value to identify two
completely different types of pixels, namely, valuable pixels in noise-free
annotations and mislabeled pixels in noisy annotations. This makes it
impossible to perform two tasks of mining valuable pixels and suppressing
mislabeled pixels at the same time. However, with the help of the prediction
confidence, we successfully solve this dilemma and simultaneously perform two
subtasks with a single reweighting strategy. Furthermore, we generalize this
strategy into an Adversarial Reweighting Module (ARM) and prove its convergence
strictly. Experiments on standard datasets shows our ARM can bring consistent
improvements for both coarse annotations and fine annotations. Specifically,
built on top of DeepLabv3+, ARM improves the mIoU on the coarsely-labeled
Cityscapes by a considerable margin and increases the mIoU on the ADE20K

artworks to determine their motifs and themes andto characterize the way these

including the interpretation of meaning, the investigation of the origin and
diffusion in time and space of representations, and the study of influences
across artists and art works. With the proliferation of digital archives of art
images, the possibility arises of applying Computer Vision techniques to the
analysis of art images at an unprecedented scale, which may support iconography
research and education. In this paper we introduce a novel paintings data set
for iconography classification and present the quantitativeand qualitative
results of applying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to the
recognition of the iconography of artworks. The proposed classifier achieves
good performances (71.17% Precision, 70.89% Recall, 70.25% F1-Score and 72.73%
Average Precision) in the task of identifying saints in Christian religious
paintings, a task made difficult by the presence of classes with very similar
visual features. Qualitative analysis of the results shows that the CNN focuses
on the traditional iconic motifs that characterize the representation of each
saint and exploits such hints to attain correct identification. The ultimate

remarkable results in skeleton-based action recognition. In GCNs, graph
topology dominates feature aggregation and therefore is the key to extracting

Refinement Graph Convolution (CTR-GC) to dynamically learn different topologies
and effectively aggregate joint features in different channels for

topologies through learning a shared topology as a generic prior for all
channels and refining it with channel-specific correlations for each channel.
Our refinement method introduces few extra parameters and significantly reduces
the difficulty of modeling channel-wise topologies. Furthermore, via
reformulating graph convolutions into a unified form, we find that CTR-GC
relaxes strict constraints of graph convolutions, leading to stronger
representation capability. Combining CTR-GC with temporal modeling modules, we
develop a powerful graph convolutional network named CTR-GCN which notably
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and

right-away. Instead, they start with an intuitive decision, reflect upon it,
spot mistakes, resolve contradictions and jump between different hypotheses.
Thus, they create a sequence of ideas and follow a train of thought that
ultimately reaches a conclusive decision. Contrary to this, today's neural
classification models are mostly trained to map an input to one single and
fixed output. In this paper, we investigate how we can give models the
opportunity of a second, third and $k$-th thought. We take inspiration from
Hegel's dialectics and propose a method that turns an existing classifier's
class prediction (such as the image class forest) into a sequence of
predictions (such as forest $\rightarrow$ tree $\rightarrow$ mushroom).
Concretely, we propose a correction module that is trained to estimate the
model's correctness as well as an iterative prediction update based on the
prediction's gradient. Our approach results in a dynamic system over class
probability distributions $\unicode{x2014}$ the thought flow. We evaluate our
method on diverse datasets and tasks from computer vision and natural language
processing. We observe surprisingly complex but intuitive behavior and
demonstrate that our method (i) can correct misclassifications, (ii)
strengthens model performance, (iii) is robust to high levels of adversarial
attacks, (iv) can increase accuracy up to 4% in a label-distribution-shift
setting and (iv) provides a tool for model interpretability that uncovers model
knowledge which otherwise remains invisible in a single distribution
prediction.]]></summary>

present in the data. However, these data biases frequently do not become
apparent until after the models are deployed. Our work tackles this issue and
enables the preemptive analysis of large-scale datasets. REVISE (REvealing
VIsual biaSEs) is a tool that assists in the investigation of a visual dataset,
surfacing potential biases along three dimensions: (1) object-based, (2)
person-based, and (3) geography-based. Object-based biases relate to the size,
context, or diversity of the depicted objects. Person-based metrics focus on
analyzing the portrayal of people within the dataset. Geography-based analyses
consider the representation of different geographic locations. These three
dimensions are deeply intertwined in how they interact to bias a dataset, and
REVISE sheds light on this; the responsibility then lies with the user to
consider the cultural and historical context, and to determine which of the
revealed biases may be problematic. The tool further assists the user by
suggesting actionable steps that may be taken to mitigate the revealed biases.
Overall, the key aim of our work is to tackle the machine learning bias problem
early in the pipeline. REVISE is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stain normalization often refers to transferring the color distribution of
the source image to that of the target image and has been widely used in
biomedical image analysis. The conventional stain normalization is regarded as
constructing a pixel-by-pixel color mapping model, which only depends on one
reference image, and can not accurately achieve the style transformation
between image datasets. In principle, this style transformation can be well
solved by the deep learning-based methods due to its complicated network
structure, whereas, its complicated structure results in the low computational
efficiency and artifacts in the style transformation, which has restricted the
practical application. Here, we use distillation learning to reduce the
complexity of deep learning methods and a fast and robust network called
StainNet to learn the color mapping between the source image and target image.
StainNet can learn the color mapping relationship from a whole dataset and
adjust the color value in a pixel-to-pixel manner. The pixel-to-pixel manner
restricts the network size and avoids artifacts in the style transformation.
The results on the cytopathology and histopathology datasets show that StainNet
can achieve comparable performance to the deep learning-based methods.
Computation results demonstrate StainNet is more than 40 times faster than
StainGAN and can normalize a 100,000x100,000 whole slide image in 40 seconds.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Outlier rejection and equivalently inlier set optimization is a key
ingredient in numerous applications in computer vision such as filtering
point-matches in camera pose estimation or plane and normal estimation in point
clouds. Several approaches exist, yet at large scale we face a combinatorial
explosion of possible solutions and state-of-the-art methods like RANSAC, Hough
transform or Branch\&Bound require a minimum inlier ratio or prior knowledge to
remain practical. In fact, for problems such as camera posing in very large
scenes these approaches become useless as they have exponential runtime growth
if these conditions aren't met. To approach the problem we present a efficient
and general algorithm for outlier rejection based on "intersecting"
$k$-dimensional surfaces in $R^d$. We provide a recipe for casting a variety of
geometric problems as finding a point in $R^d$ which maximizes the number of
nearby surfaces (and thus inliers). The resulting algorithm has linear
worst-case complexity with a better runtime dependency in the approximation
factor than competing algorithms while not requiring domain specific bounds.
This is achieved by introducing a space decomposition scheme that bounds the
number of computations by successively rounding and grouping samples. Our
recipe (and open-source code) enables anybody to derive such fast approaches to
new problems across a wide range of domains. We demonstrate the versatility of
the approach on several camera posing problems with a high number of matches at
low inlier ratio achieving state-of-the-art results at significantly lower
processing times.]]></summary>

the early treatment on the infected yield, and it helps reduce the loss for the
agriculture economy. Design an automatic pest recognition system is necessary
because manual recognition is slow, time-consuming, and expensive. The
Image-based pest classifier using the traditional computer vision method is not
efficient due to the complexity. Insect pest classification is a difficult task
because of various kinds, scales, shapes, complex backgrounds in the field, and
high appearance similarity among insect species. With the rapid development of
deep learning technology, the CNN-based method is the best way to develop a
fast and accurate insect pest classifier. We present different convolutional
neural network-based models in this work, including attention, feature pyramid,
and fine-grained models. We evaluate our methods on two public datasets: the
large-scale insect pest dataset, the IP102 benchmark dataset, and a smaller
dataset, namely D0 in terms of the macro-average precision (MPre), the
macro-average recall (MRec), the macro-average F1- score (MF1), the accuracy
(Acc), and the geometric mean (GM). The experimental results show that
combining these convolutional neural network-based models can better perform
than the state-of-the-art methods on these two datasets. For instance, the
highest accuracy we obtained on IP102 and D0 is $74.13\%$ and $99.78\%$,
respectively, bypassing the corresponding state-of-the-art accuracy: $67.1\%$
(IP102) and $98.8\%$ (D0). We also publish our codes for contributing to the

operation is the inspection of gallbladder (GB) to evaluate the thickness of
its wall, presence of inflammation and extent of fat. Difficulty in
visualization of the GB wall vessels may be due to the previous factors,
potentially as a result of chronic inflammation or other diseases. In this
paper we propose a multiple-instance learning (MIL) technique for assessment of
the GB wall vascularity via computer-vision analysis of images from LC
operations. The bags correspond to a labeled (low vs. high) vascularity dataset
of 181 GB images, from 53 operations. The instances correspond to unlabeled
patches extracted from these images. Each patch is represented by a vector with
color, texture and statistical features. We compare various state-of-the-art
MIL and single-instance learning approaches, as well as a proposed MIL
technique based on variational Bayesian inference. The methods were compared
for two experimental tasks: image-based and video-based (i.e. patient-based)

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network
(BiRNN) that helps to achieve both the aforementioned objectives. The temporal
dependencies present in AI synthesized speech are exploited using Bidirectional
RNN and CNN. The model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by
classifying the AI synthesized audio from real human speech with an error rate
of 1.9% and detecting the underlying architecture with an accuracy of 97%.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ability to edit facial expressions has a wide range of applications in
computer graphics. The ideal facial expression editing algorithm needs to
satisfy two important criteria. First, it should allow precise and targeted
editing of individual facial actions. Second, it should generate high fidelity
outputs without artifacts. We build a solution based on StyleGAN, which has
been used extensively for semantic manipulation of faces. As we do so, we add
to our understanding of how various semantic attributes are encoded in
StyleGAN. In particular, we show that a naive strategy to perform editing in
the latent space results in undesired coupling between certain action units,
even if they are conceptually distinct. For example, although brow lowerer and
lip tightener are distinct action units, they appear correlated in the training
data. Hence, StyleGAN has difficulty in disentangling them. We allow
disentangled editing of such action units by computing detached regions of
influence for each action unit, and restrict editing to these regions. We
validate the effectiveness of our local editing method through perception
experiments conducted with 23 subjects. The results show that our method
provides higher control over local editing and produces images with superior
fidelity compared to the state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

morbidity rate and a mortality rate of more than three percent, which seriously
endangers human health. The main method of acquiring brain tumors in the clinic
is MRI. Segmentation of brain tumor regions from multi-modal MRI scan images is
helpful for treatment inspection, post-diagnosis monitoring, and effect
evaluation of patients. However, the common operation in clinical brain tumor
segmentation is still manual segmentation, lead to its time-consuming and large
performance difference between different operators, a consistent and accurate
automatic segmentation method is urgently needed. Methods: To meet the above
challenges, we propose an automatic brain tumor MRI data segmentation framework
which is called AGSE-VNet. In our study, the Squeeze and Excite (SE) module is
added to each encoder, the Attention Guide Filter (AG) module is added to each
decoder, using the channel relationship to automatically enhance the useful
information in the channel to suppress the useless information, and use the
attention mechanism to guide the edge information and remove the influence of
irrelevant information such as noise. Results: We used the BraTS2020 challenge
online verification tool to evaluate our approach. The focus of verification is
that the Dice scores of the whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC) and enhanced
tumor (ET) are 0.68, 0.85 and 0.70, respectively. Conclusion: Although MRI
images have different intensities, AGSE-VNet is not affected by the size of the
tumor, and can more accurately extract the features of the three regions, it
has achieved impressive results and made outstanding contributions to the
clinical diagnosis and treatment of brain tumor patients.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video-text retrieval is an important yet challenging task in vision-language
understanding, which aims to learn a joint embedding space where related video
and text instances are close to each other. Most current works simply measure
the video-text similarity based on video-level and text-level embeddings.
However, the neglect of more fine-grained or local information causes the
problem of insufficient representation. Some works exploit the local details by
disentangling sentences, but overlook the corresponding videos, causing the
asymmetry of video-text representation. To address the above limitations, we
propose a Hierarchical Alignment Network (HANet) to align different level
representations for video-text matching. Specifically, we first decompose video
and text into three semantic levels, namely event (video and text), action
(motion and verb), and entity (appearance and noun). Based on these, we
naturally construct hierarchical representations in the individual-local-global
manner, where the individual level focuses on the alignment between frame and
word, local level focuses on the alignment between video clip and textual
context, and global level focuses on the alignment between the whole video and
text. Different level alignments capture fine-to-coarse correlations between
video and text, as well as take the advantage of the complementary information
among three semantic levels. Besides, our HANet is also richly interpretable by
explicitly learning key semantic concepts. Extensive experiments on two public
datasets, namely MSR-VTT and VATEX, show the proposed HANet outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness of hierarchical
representation and alignment. Our code is publicly available.]]></summary>

evaluating visual semantic embedding models on a ZSL setting in which semantic

binding to target sites of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). While identifying functional
targets of miRNAs is of utmost importance, their prediction remains a great

conservative candidate target site (CTS) selection criteria mainly focusing on
canonical site types, rely on laborious and time-consuming manual feature
extraction, and do not fully capitalize on the information underlying miRNA-CTS

relaxed CTS selection criteria accommodating irregularities in the seed region,
(2) a novel miRNA-CTS sequence encoding scheme incorporating extended seed
region alignments, and (3) a deep residual network-based prediction model. The
proposed model was trained with miRNA-CTS pair datasets and evaluated with

to extract features. Since the number of parameters increases quadratically
with the size of the convolution kernel, many popular models use small
convolution kernels, resulting in small local receptive fields in lower layers.
This paper proposes a novel log-polar space convolution (LPSC) method, where
the convolution kernel is elliptical and adaptively divides its local receptive
field into different regions according to the relative directions and
logarithmic distances. The local receptive field grows exponentially with the
number of distance levels. Therefore, the proposed LPSC not only naturally
encodes local spatial structures, but also greatly increases the single-layer
receptive field while maintaining the number of parameters. We show that LPSC
can be implemented with conventional convolution via log-polar space pooling
and can be applied in any network architecture to replace conventional
convolutions. Experiments on different tasks and datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed LPSC. Code is available at

two different class sets, a mixup module is re-proposed and integrated into the
meta-learning mechanism. Secondly, a novel disentangle module together with a
domain classifier is proposed to extract the disentangled domain-irrelevant and
domain-specific features. These two modules together enable our model to narrow
the domain gap thus generalizing well to the target datasets. Additionally, a
detailed feasibility and pilot study is conducted to reflect the intuitive

topics in computer vision. Great progress have been made to date, with the
latest models starting to focus on the more practical "in-the-wild" setting.
However, a salient problem still hinders practical deployment -- prior arts
mostly struggle with recognising unseen (or rarely seen) character sequences.
In this paper, we put forward a novel framework to specifically tackle this
"unseen" problem. Our framework is iterative in nature, in that it utilises
predicted knowledge of character sequences from a previous iteration, to
augment the main network in improving the next prediction. Key to our success
is a unique cross-modal variational autoencoder to act as a feedback module,
which is trained with the presence of textual error distribution data. This
module importantly translate a discrete predicted character space, to a

predictions of these networks has become increasingly recognized. While many
methods for explaining the decisions of deep neural networks exist, there is
currently no consensus on how to evaluate them. On the other hand, robustness
is a popular topic for deep learning research; however, it is hardly talked
about in explainability until very recently. In this tutorial paper, we start
by presenting gradient-based interpretability methods. These techniques use
gradient signals to assign the burden of the decision on the input features.
Later, we discuss how gradient-based methods can be evaluated for their
robustness and the role that adversarial robustness plays in having meaningful
explanations. We also discuss the limitations of gradient-based methods.
Finally, we present the best practices and attributes that should be examined
before choosing an explainability method. We conclude with the future
directions for research in the area at the convergence of robustness and
explainability.]]></summary>

prediction, but missing data in clinical cohorts limits the number of subjects
in multi-modal learning context. Multi-modal missing imputation is challenging
with existing methods when 1) the missing data span across heterogeneous
modalities (e.g., image vs. non-image); or 2) one modality is largely missing.
In this paper, we address imputation of missing data by modeling the joint
distribution of multi-modal data. Motivated by partial bidirectional generative
adversarial net (PBiGAN), we propose a new Conditional PBiGAN (C-PBiGAN) method
that imputes one modality combining the conditional knowledge from another
modality. Specifically, C-PBiGAN introduces a conditional latent space in a
missing imputation framework that jointly encodes the available multi-modal
data, along with a class regularization loss on imputed data to recover
discriminative information. To our knowledge, it is the first generative
adversarial model that addresses multi-modal missing imputation by modeling the
joint distribution of image and non-image data. We validate our model with both
the national lung screening trial (NLST) dataset and an external clinical
validation cohort. The proposed C-PBiGAN achieves significant improvements in
lung cancer risk estimation compared with representative imputation methods
(e.g., AUC values increase in both NLST (+2.9\%) and in-house dataset (+4.3\%)
compared with PBiGAN, p$<$0.05).]]></summary>

related to the image by utilizing the background knowledge in the associated
article. This task remains challenging as it is difficult to learn the
association between named entities and visual cues due to the long-tail
distribution of named entities. Furthermore, the complexity of the article
brings difficulty in extracting fine-grained relationships between entities to
generate informative event descriptions about the image. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel approach that constructs a multi-modal knowledge
graph to associate the visual objects with named entities and capture the
relationship between entities simultaneously with the help of external
knowledge collected from the web. Specifically, we build a text sub-graph by
extracting named entities and their relationships from the article, and build
an image sub-graph by detecting the objects in the image. To connect these two
sub-graphs, we propose a cross-modal entity matching module trained using a
knowledge base that contains Wikipedia entries and the corresponding images.
Finally, the multi-modal knowledge graph is integrated into the captioning
model via a graph attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on both GoodNews

determine road boundaries to constrain vehicles on roads, so that potential
accidents could be avoided. Most of the current methods detect road curbs
online using vehicle-mounted sensors, such as cameras or 3-D Lidars. However,
these methods usually suffer from severe occlusion issues. Especially in
highly-dynamic traffic environments, most of the field of view is occupied by
dynamic objects. To alleviate this issue, we detect road curbs offline using
high-resolution aerial images in this paper. Moreover, the detected road curbs
can be used to create high-definition (HD) maps for autonomous vehicles.
Specifically, we first predict the pixel-wise segmentation map of road curbs,
and then conduct a series of post-processing steps to extract the graph
structure of road curbs. To tackle the disconnectivity issue in the
segmentation maps, we propose an innovative connectivity-preserving loss
(CP-loss) to improve the segmentation performance. The experimental results on
a public dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed loss function.

just a small number of labeled samples per class are given. We introduce
Transductive Maximum Margin Classifier (TMMC) for few-shot learning. The basic
idea of the classical maximum margin classifier is to solve an optimal
prediction function that the corresponding separating hyperplane can correctly
divide the training data and the resulting classifier has the largest geometric
margin. In few-shot learning scenarios, the training samples are scarce, not
enough to find a separating hyperplane with good generalization ability on
unseen data. TMMC is constructed using a mixture of the labeled support set and
the unlabeled query set in a given task. The unlabeled samples in the query set
can adjust the separating hyperplane so that the prediction function is optimal
on both the labeled and unlabeled samples. Furthermore, we leverage an
efficient and effective quasi-Newton algorithm, the L-BFGS method to optimize
TMMC. Experimental results on three standard few-shot learning benchmarks
including miniImagenet, tieredImagenet and CUB suggest that our TMMC achieves

can be a key challenge for visual object tracking, affecting tracking accuracy
significantly. In this work, we explore the robustness of visual object
trackers against motion blur from a new angle, i.e., adversarial blur attack
(ABA). Our main objective is to online transfer input frames to their natural
motion-blurred counterparts while misleading the state-of-the-art trackers
during the tracking process. To this end, we first design the motion blur
synthesizing method for visual tracking based on the generation principle of
motion blur, considering the motion information and the light accumulation
process. With this synthetic method, we propose \textit{optimization-based ABA
(OP-ABA)} by iteratively optimizing an adversarial objective function against
the tracking w.r.t. the motion and light accumulation parameters. The OP-ABA is
able to produce natural adversarial examples but the iteration can cause heavy
time cost, making it unsuitable for attacking real-time trackers. To alleviate
this issue, we further propose \textit{one-step ABA (OS-ABA)} where we design
and train a joint adversarial motion and accumulation predictive network
(JAMANet) with the guidance of OP-ABA, which is able to efficiently estimate
the adversarial motion and accumulation parameters in a one-step way. The

state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still struggle in the wild scenarios due to
complex backgrounds, varying fonts, uncontrolled illuminations, distortions and
other artefacts. This is because such models solely depend on visual
information for text recognition, thus lacking semantic reasoning capabilities.
In this paper, we argue that semantic information offers a complementary role
in addition to visual only. More specifically, we additionally utilize semantic
information by proposing a multi-stage multi-scale attentional decoder that
performs joint visual-semantic reasoning. Our novelty lies in the intuition
that for text recognition, the prediction should be refined in a stage-wise
manner. Therefore our key contribution is in designing a stage-wise unrolling
attentional decoder where non-differentiability, invoked by discretely
predicted character labels, needs to be bypassed for end-to-end training. While
the first stage predicts using visual features, subsequent stages refine on top
of it using joint visual-semantic information. Additionally, we introduce
multi-scale 2D attention along with dense and residual connections between
different stages to deal with varying scales of character sizes, for better
performance and faster convergence during training. Experimental results show
our approach to outperform existing SOTA methods by a considerable margin.]]></summary>

at the time of data scarcity. However, such success is only limited to quite a
few light augmentations (e.g., random crop, flip). Heavy augmentations (e.g.,
gray, grid shuffle) are either unstable or show adverse effects during
training, owing to the big gap between the original and augmented images. This
paper introduces a novel network design, noted as Augmentation Pathways (AP),
to systematically stabilize training on a much wider range of augmentation
policies. Notably, AP tames heavy data augmentations and stably boosts
performance without a careful selection among augmentation policies. Unlike
traditional single pathway, augmented images are processed in different neural
paths. The main pathway handles light augmentations, while other pathways focus
on heavy augmentations. By interacting with multiple paths in a dependent
manner, the backbone network robustly learns from shared visual patterns among
augmentations, and suppresses noisy patterns at the same time. Furthermore, we
extend AP to a homogeneous version and a heterogeneous version for high-order
scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and flexibility in practical usage.
Experimental results on ImageNet benchmarks demonstrate the compatibility and
effectiveness on a much wider range of augmentations (e.g., Crop, Gray, Grid
Shuffle, RandAugment), while consuming fewer parameters and lower computational
costs at inference time. Source code:https://github.com/ap-conv/ap-net.]]></summary>

clots. PE accounts for approximately 100,000 deaths per year in the United
States alone. The clinical presentation of PE is often nonspecific, making the
diagnosis challenging. Thus, rapid and accurate risk stratification is of
paramount importance. High-risk PE is caused by right ventricular (RV)
dysfunction from acute pressure overload, which in return can help identify
which patients require more aggressive therapy. Reconstructed four-chamber
views of the heart on chest CT can detect right ventricular enlargement. CT
pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the golden standard in the diagnostic workup of
suspected PE. Therefore, it can link between diagnosis and risk stratification
strategies. We developed a weakly supervised deep learning algorithm, with an
emphasis on a novel attention mechanism, to automatically classify RV strain on
CTPA. Our method is a 3D DenseNet model with integrated 3D residual attention
blocks. We evaluated our model on a dataset of CTPAs of emergency department
(ED) PE patients. This model achieved an area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.88 for classifying RV strain. The model showed
a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 83.7%. Our solution outperforms
state-of-the-art 3D CNN networks. The proposed design allows for a fully
automated network that can be trained easily in an end-to-end manner without
requiring computationally intensive and time-consuming preprocessing or
strenuous labeling of the data.We infer that unmarked CTPAs can be used for
effective RV strain classification. This could be used as a second reader,
alerting for high-risk PE patients. To the best of our knowledge, there are no
previous deep learning-based studies that attempted to solve this problem.]]></summary>

for several applications such as access control for instance. Unfortunately,
with the increased deployment of biometric applications, we observe an increase
of attacks. Therefore, algorithms to detect such attacks (Presentation Attack
Detection (PAD)) have been increasing in relevance. The LivDet-2020 competition
which focuses on Presentation Attacks Detection (PAD) algorithms have shown
still open problems, specially for unknown attacks scenarios. In order to
improve the robustness of biometric systems, it is crucial to improve PAD
methods. This can be achieved by augmenting the number of presentation attack
instruments (PAI) and bona fide images that are used to train such algorithms.
Unfortunately, the capture and creation of presentation attack instruments and
even the capture of bona fide images is sometimes complex to achieve. This
paper proposes a novel PAI synthetically created (SPI-PAI) using four
state-of-the-art GAN algorithms (cGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, and StyleGAN2) and a
small set of periocular NIR images. A benchmark between GAN algorithms is
performed using the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) between the generated
images and the original images used for training. The best PAD algorithm
reported by the LivDet-2020 competition was tested for us using the synthetic
PAI which was obtained with the StyleGAN2 algorithm. Surprisingly, The PAD
algorithm was not able to detect the synthetic images as a Presentation Attack,
categorizing all of them as bona fide. Such results demonstrated the
feasibility of synthetic images to fool presentation attacks detection
algorithms and the need for such algorithms to be constantly updated and
trained with a larger number of images and PAI scenarios.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Text recognition remains a fundamental and extensively researched topic in
computer vision, largely owing to its wide array of commercial applications.
The challenging nature of the very problem however dictated a fragmentation of
research efforts: Scene Text Recognition (STR) that deals with text in everyday
scenes, and Handwriting Text Recognition (HTR) that tackles hand-written text.
In this paper, for the first time, we argue for their unification -- we aim for
a single model that can compete favourably with two separate state-of-the-art
STR and HTR models. We first show that cross-utilisation of STR and HTR models
trigger significant performance drops due to differences in their inherent
challenges. We then tackle their union by introducing a knowledge distillation
(KD) based framework. This is however non-trivial, largely due to the
variable-length and sequential nature of text sequences, which renders
off-the-shelf KD techniques that mostly works with global fixed-length data
inadequate. For that, we propose three distillation losses all of which are
specifically designed to cope with the aforementioned unique characteristics of
text recognition. Empirical evidence suggests that our proposed unified model
performs on par with individual models, even surpassing them in certain cases.
Ablative studies demonstrate that naive baselines such as a two-stage
framework, and domain adaption/generalisation alternatives do not work as well,
further verifying the appropriateness of our design.]]></summary>

the current state-of-the-art still suffers from common real-world challenges
such as appearance similarity among various people, occlusions, and frame
misalignment. To alleviate these problems, we propose Spatio-Temporal
Representation Factorization module (STRF), a flexible new computational unit
that can be used in conjunction with most existing 3D convolutional neural
network architectures for re-ID. The key innovations of STRF over prior work
include explicit pathways for learning discriminative temporal and spatial
features, with each component further factorized to capture complementary
person-specific appearance and motion information. Specifically, temporal
factorization comprises two branches, one each for static features (e.g., the
color of clothes) that do not change much over time, and dynamic features
(e.g., walking patterns) that change over time. Further, spatial factorization
also comprises two branches to learn both global (coarse segments) as well as
local (finer segments) appearance features, with the local features
particularly useful in cases of occlusion or spatial misalignment. These two
factorization operations taken together result in a modular architecture for
our parameter-wise economic STRF unit that can be plugged in between any two 3D
convolutional layers, resulting in an end-to-end learning framework. We
empirically show that STRF improves performance of various existing baseline
architectures while demonstrating new state-of-the-art results using standard
person re-identification evaluation protocols on three benchmarks.]]></summary>

emphasis has been put on its inverse: ignoring distraction. Our daily lives
require us to explicitly avoid giving attention to salient visual features that

In this work, we introduce Neural Blindness, which gives an agent the ability
to completely ignore objects or classes that are deemed distractors. More
explicitly, we aim to render a neural network completely incapable of
representing specific chosen classes in its latent space. In a very real sense,
this makes the network "blind" to certain classes, allowing and agent to focus

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to model fine-grained spatial-temporal dynamics in videos has been a
challenging problem for action recognition. It requires learning deep and rich
features with superior distinctiveness for the subtle and abstract motions.
Most existing methods generate features of a layer in a pure feedforward
manner, where the information moves in one direction from inputs to outputs.
And they rely on stacking more layers to obtain more powerful features,
bringing extra non-negligible overheads. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive
Recursive Circle (ARC) framework, a fine-grained decorator for pure feedforward
layers. It inherits the operators and parameters of the original layer but is
slightly different in the use of those operators and parameters. Specifically,
the input of the layer is treated as an evolving state, and its update is
alternated with the feature generation. At each recursive step, the input state
is enriched by the previously generated features and the feature generation is
made with the newly updated input state. We hope the ARC framework can
facilitate fine-grained action recognition by introducing deeply refined
features and multi-scale receptive fields at a low cost. Significant
improvements over feedforward baselines are observed on several benchmarks. For
example, an ARC-equipped TSM-ResNet18 outperforms TSM-ResNet50 with 48% fewer
FLOPs and 52% model parameters on Something-Something V1 and Diving48.]]></summary>

(BdSL), there are 38 alphabets with some having nearly identical symbols. As a
result, in BdSL recognition, the posture of hand is an important factor in
addition to visual features extracted from traditional Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN). In this paper, a novel architecture "Concatenated BdSL Network"
is proposed which consists of a CNN based image network and a pose estimation
network. While the image network gets the visual features, the relative
positions of hand keypoints are taken by the pose estimation network to obtain
the additional features to deal with the complexity of the BdSL symbols. A
score of 91.51% was achieved by this novel approach in test set and the
effectiveness of the additional pose estimation network is suggested by the
experimental results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semantic segmentation is a challenging task in the absence of densely
labelled data. Only relying on class activation maps (CAM) with image-level
labels provides deficient segmentation supervision. Prior works thus consider
pre-trained models to produce coarse saliency maps to guide the generation of
pseudo segmentation labels. However, the commonly used off-line heuristic
generation process cannot fully exploit the benefits of these coarse saliency
maps. Motivated by the significant inter-task correlation, we propose a novel
weakly supervised multi-task framework termed as AuxSegNet, to leverage
saliency detection and multi-label image classification as auxiliary tasks to
improve the primary task of semantic segmentation using only image-level
ground-truth labels. Inspired by their similar structured semantics, we also
propose to learn a cross-task global pixel-level affinity map from the saliency
and segmentation representations. The learned cross-task affinity can be used
to refine saliency predictions and propagate CAM maps to provide improved
pseudo labels for both tasks. The mutual boost between pseudo label updating
and cross-task affinity learning enables iterative improvements on segmentation
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed auxiliary learning network structure and the cross-task affinity
learning method. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art weakly
supervised segmentation performance on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS
COCO benchmarks.]]></summary>

Most of them declare they have achieved state-of-the-art performances. However,
the performance comparison is unfair, due to lots of inconsistent settings
(e.g., training data, backbone network, multi-scale feature fusion, evaluation
protocols, etc.). These various settings would dissemble the pros and cons of
the proposed core techniques. In this paper, we carefully examine and analyze
the inconsistent settings, and propose a unified framework for the bottom-up
based scene text detection methods. Under the unified framework, we ensure the
consistent settings for non-core modules, and mainly investigate the
representations of describing arbitrary-shape scene texts, e.g., regressing
points on text contours, clustering pixels with predicted auxiliary
information, grouping connected components with learned linkages, etc. With the
comprehensive investigations and elaborate analyses, it not only cleans up the
obstacle of understanding the performance differences between existing methods
but also reveals the advantages and disadvantages of previous models under fair

Haralick features and further segmenting the characters using artificial neural
networks. The image is divided into kernels, each of which is converted to a
GLCM (Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix) on which a Haralick Feature generation
function is called, the result of which is an array with fourteen elements
corresponding to fourteen features The Haralick values and the corresponding
noise/text classification form a dictionary, which is then used to de-noise the
image through kernel comparison. Segmentation is the process of extracting
characters from a document and can be used when letters are separated by white
space, which is an explicit boundary marker. Segmentation is the first step in
many Natural Language Processing problems. This paper explores the process of
segmentation using Neural Networks. While there have been numerous methods to
segment characters of a document, this paper is only concerned with the
accuracy of doing so using neural networks. It is imperative that the
characters be segmented correctly, for failing to do so will lead to incorrect
recognition by Natural language processing tools. Artificial Neural Networks
was used to attain accuracy of upto 89%. This method is suitable for languages
where the characters are delimited by white space. However, this method will
fail to provide acceptable results when the language heavily uses connected
letters. An example would be the Devanagari script, which is predominantly used
in northern India.]]></summary>

evaluation of tissues during surgical operations. The high speed of procedure
allows pathologists to rapidly assess the key microscopic features, such as
tumor margins and malignant status to guide surgical decision-making and
minimise disruptions to the course of the operation. However, FS is prone to
introducing many misleading artificial structures (histological artefacts),
such as nuclear ice crystals, compression, and cutting artefacts, hindering
timely and accurate diagnostic judgement of the pathologist. On the other hand,
the gold standard tissue preparation technique of formalin-fixation and
paraffin-embedding (FFPE) provides significantly superior image quality, but is
a very time-consuming process (12-48 hours), making it unsuitable for
intra-operative use. In this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI)
method that improves FS image quality by computationally transforming
frozen-sectioned whole-slide images (FS-WSIs) into whole-slide FFPE-style
images in minutes. AI-FFPE rectifies FS artefacts with the guidance of an
attention-mechanism that puts a particular emphasis on artefacts while
utilising a self-regularization mechanism established between FS input image
and synthesized FFPE-style image that preserves clinically relevant features.
As a result, AI-FFPE method successfully generates FFPE-style images without
significantly extending tissue processing time and consequently improves
diagnostic accuracy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Defects are unavoidable in casting production owing to the complexity of the
casting process. While conventional human-visual inspection of casting products
is slow and unproductive in mass productions, an automatic and reliable defect
detection not just enhances the quality control process but positively improves
productivity. However, casting defect detection is a challenging task due to
diversity and variation in defects' appearance. Convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) have been widely applied in both image classification and defect
detection tasks. Howbeit, CNNs with frequentist inference require a massive
amount of data to train on and still fall short in reporting beneficial
estimates of their predictive uncertainty. Accordingly, leveraging the transfer
learning paradigm, we first apply four powerful CNN-based models (VGG16,
ResNet50, DenseNet121, and InceptionResNetV2) on a small dataset to extract
meaningful features. Extracted features are then processed by various machine
learning algorithms to perform the classification task. Simulation results
demonstrate that linear support vector machine (SVM) and multi-layer perceptron
(MLP) show the finest performance in defect detection of casting images.
Secondly, to achieve a reliable classification and to measure epistemic
uncertainty, we employ an uncertainty quantification (UQ) technique (ensemble
of MLP models) using features extracted from four pre-trained CNNs. UQ
confusion matrix and uncertainty accuracy metric are also utilized to evaluate
the predictive uncertainty estimates. Comprehensive comparisons reveal that UQ
method based on VGG16 outperforms others to fetch uncertainty. We believe an
uncertainty-aware automatic defect detection solution will reinforce casting
productions quality assurance.]]></summary>

further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the transformer, there are
two trains of thought among existing works: (1) going wider by scaling to more
trainable parameters; (2) going shallower by parameter sharing or model
compressing along with the depth. However, larger models usually do not scale
well when fewer tokens are available to train, and advanced parallelisms are
required when the model is extremely large. Smaller models usually achieve
inferior performance compared to the original transformer model due to the loss
of representation power. In this paper, to achieve better performance with
fewer trainable parameters, we propose a framework to deploy trainable
parameters efficiently, by going wider instead of deeper. Specially, we scale
along model width by replacing feed-forward network (FFN) with
mixture-of-experts (MoE). We then share the MoE layers across transformer
blocks using individual layer normalization. Such deployment plays the role to
transform various semantic representations, which makes the model more
parameter-efficient and effective. To evaluate our framework, we design WideNet
and evaluate it on ImageNet-1K. Our best model outperforms Vision Transformer
(ViT) by $1.46\%$ with $0.72 \times$ trainable parameters. Using $0.46 \times$
and $0.13 \times$ parameters, our WideNet can still surpass ViT and ViT-MoE by

Egyptian vehicles license plates. Two systems are based on character
recognition, which are (System1, Characters Recognition with Classical Machine

other two systems are based on the whole plate recognition which are (System3,
Whole License Plate Recognition with Classical Machine Learning) and (System4,
Whole License Plate Recognition with Deep Machine Learning). We use object
detection algorithms, and machine learning based object recognition algorithms.
The performance of the developed systems has been tested on real images, and
the experimental results demonstrate that the best detection accuracy rate for
VLP is provided by using the deep learning method. Where the VLP detection
accuracy rate is better than the classical system by 32%. However, the best
detection accuracy rate for Vehicle License Plate Arabic Character (VLPAC) is
provided by using the classical method. Where VLPAC detection accuracy rate is
better than the deep learning-based system by 6%. Also, the results show that
deep learning is better than the classical technique used in VLP recognition
processes. Where the recognition accuracy rate is better than the classical
system by 8%. Finally, the paper output recommends a robust VLP recognition
system based on both statistical and deep machine learning.]]></summary>

recognition and classification tasks. However, fusing multiple modalities in
remote sensing is cumbersome due to highly disparate domains. Furthermore, the
existing methods do not facilitate cross-modal interactions. To this end, we
propose a novel transformer based fusion method for HSI and LiDAR modalities.
The model is composed of stacked auto encoders that harness the cross key-value
pairs for HSI and LiDAR, thus establishing a communication between the two
modalities, while simultaneously using the CNNs to extract the spectral and

burden or to accelerate the downstream processing speed. However, the inverse
upscaling step is non-trivial, and the downscaled video may also deteriorate
the performance of downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a
self-conditioned probabilistic framework for video rescaling to learn the
paired downscaling and upscaling procedures simultaneously. During the
training, we decrease the entropy of the information lost in the downscaling by
maximizing its probability conditioned on the strong spatial-temporal prior
information within the downscaled video. After optimization, the downscaled
video by our framework preserves more meaningful information, which is
beneficial for both the upscaling step and the downstream tasks, e.g., video
action recognition task. We further extend the framework to a lossy video
compression system, in which a gradient estimator for non-differential
industrial lossy codecs is proposed for the end-to-end training of the whole
system. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our
approach on video rescaling, video compression, and efficient action
recognition tasks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LiDAR sensors can be used to obtain a wide range of measurement signals other
than a simple 3D point cloud, and those signals can be leveraged to improve
perception tasks like 3D object detection. A single laser pulse can be
partially reflected by multiple objects along its path, resulting in multiple
measurements called echoes. Multi-echo measurement can provide information
about object contours and semi-transparent surfaces which can be used to better
identify and locate objects. LiDAR can also measure surface reflectance
(intensity of laser pulse return), as well as ambient light of the scene
(sunlight reflected by objects). These signals are already available in
commercial LiDAR devices but have not been used in most LiDAR-based detection
models. We present a 3D object detection model which leverages the full
spectrum of measurement signals provided by LiDAR. First, we propose a
multi-signal fusion (MSF) module to combine (1) the reflectance and ambient
features extracted with a 2D CNN, and (2) point cloud features extracted using
a 3D graph neural network (GNN). Second, we propose a multi-echo aggregation
(MEA) module to combine the information encoded in different set of echo
points. Compared with traditional single echo point cloud methods, our proposed
Multi-Signal LiDAR Detector (MSLiD) extracts richer context information from a
wider range of sensing measurements and achieves more accurate 3D object
detection. Experiments show that by incorporating the multi-modality of LiDAR,
our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by up to 9.1%.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video activity localisation has recently attained increasing attention due to
its practical values in automatically localising the most salient visual
segments corresponding to their language descriptions (sentences) from
untrimmed and unstructured videos. For supervised model training, a temporal
annotation of both the start and end time index of each video segment for a
sentence (a video moment) must be given. This is not only very expensive but
also sensitive to ambiguity and subjective annotation bias, a much harder task
than image labelling. In this work, we develop a more accurate
weakly-supervised solution by introducing Cross-Sentence Relations Mining (CRM)
in video moment proposal generation and matching when only a paragraph
description of activities without per-sentence temporal annotation is
available. Specifically, we explore two cross-sentence relational constraints:
(1) Temporal ordering and (2) semantic consistency among sentences in a
paragraph description of video activities. Existing weakly-supervised
techniques only consider within-sentence video segment correlations in training
without considering cross-sentence paragraph context. This can mislead due to
ambiguous expressions of individual sentences with visually indiscriminate
video moment proposals in isolation. Experiments on two publicly available
activity localisation datasets show the advantages of our approach over the
state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods, especially so when the video
activity descriptions become more complex.]]></summary>

space, has attracted sustained attention in the community of machine learning.
Hyperbolic space, owing to its ability to embed hierarchical structures
continuously with low distortion, has been applied for learning data with
tree-like structures. Hyperbolic Neural Networks (HNNs) that operate directly
in hyperbolic space have also been proposed recently to further exploit the
potential of hyperbolic representations. While HNNs have achieved better
performance than Euclidean neural networks (ENNs) on datasets with implicit
hierarchical structure, they still perform poorly on standard classification
benchmarks such as CIFAR and ImageNet. The traditional wisdom is that it is
critical for the data to respect the hyperbolic geometry when applying HNNs. In
this paper, we first conduct an empirical study showing that the inferior
performance of HNNs on standard recognition datasets can be attributed to the
notorious vanishing gradient problem. We further discovered that this problem
stems from the hybrid architecture of HNNs. Our analysis leads to a simple yet
effective solution called Feature Clipping, which regularizes the hyperbolic
embedding whenever its norm exceeding a given threshold. Our thorough
experiments show that the proposed method can successfully avoid the vanishing
gradient problem when training HNNs with backpropagation. The improved HNNs are
able to achieve comparable performance with ENNs on standard image recognition
datasets including MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet, while demonstrating
more adversarial robustness and stronger out-of-distribution detection
capability.]]></summary>

image analysis tasks. Cardiac MRI segmentation is one such application which,
like many others, requires a large number of annotated data so a trained
network can generalize well. Unfortunately, the process of having a large
number of manually curated images by medical experts is both slow and utterly
expensive. In this paper, we set out to explore whether expert knowledge is a
strict requirement for the creation of annotated datasets that machine learning
can successfully train on. To do so, we gauged the performance of three
segmentation models, namely U-Net, Attention U-Net, and ENet, trained with
different loss functions on expert and non-expert groundtruth for cardiac
cine-MRI segmentation. Evaluation was done with classic segmentation metrics
(Dice index and Hausdorff distance) as well as clinical measurements, such as
the ventricular ejection fractions and the myocardial mass. Results reveal that
generalization performances of a segmentation neural network trained on
non-expert groundtruth data is, to all practical purposes, as good as on expert
groundtruth data, in particular when the non-expert gets a decent level of
training, highlighting an opportunity for the efficient and cheap creation of
annotations for cardiac datasets.]]></summary>

yet it faces great challenges of various shapes, diverse sizes, and blurry
boundaries. To address these difficulties, square kernel-based encoder-decoder
architecture has been proposed and widely used, but its performance remains
still unsatisfactory. To further cope with these challenges, we present a novel
double-branch encoder architecture. Our architecture is inspired by two
observations: 1) Since the discrimination of features learned via square
convolutional kernels needs to be further improved, we propose to utilize
non-square vertical and horizontal convolutional kernels in the double-branch
encoder, so features learned by the two branches can be expected to complement
each other. 2) Considering that spatial attention can help models to better
focus on the target region in a large-sized image, we develop an attention loss
to further emphasize the segmentation on small-sized targets. Together, the
above two schemes give rise to a novel double-branch encoder segmentation
framework for medical image segmentation, namely Crosslink-Net. The experiments
validate the effectiveness of our model on four datasets. The code is released

by presenting gradient-based interpretability methods. These techniques use
gradient signals to assign the burden of the decision on the input features.
Later, we discuss how gradient-based methods can be evaluated for their
robustness and the role that adversarial robustness plays in having meaningful
explanations. We also discuss the limitations of gradient-based methods.
Finally, we present the best practices and attributes that should be examined

been vigorously studied in the last decade. Until now, there have being
developed several techniques for imaging of a single object through scattering
medium by using neural networks, however how to reconstruct images of more than
one object simultaneously seems hard to realize. In this paper, we demonstrate
an approach by using generative adversarial network (GAN) to reconstruct images
of two adjacent objects through scattering media. We construct an imaging
system for imaging of two adjacent objects behind the scattering media. In
general, as the light field of two adjacent object images pass through the
scattering slab, a speckle pattern is obtained. The designed adversarial
network, which is called as YGAN, is employed to reconstruct the images
simultaneously. It is shown that based on the trained YGAN, we can reconstruct
images of two adjacent objects from one speckle pattern with high fidelity. In
addition, we study the influence of the object image types, and the distance
between the two adjacent objects on the fidelity of the reconstructed images.
Moreover even if another scattering medium is inserted between the two objects,
we can also reconstruct the images of two objects from a speckle with high
quality. The technique presented in this work can be used for applications in
areas of medical image analysis, such as medical image classification,
segmentation, and studies of multi-object scattering imaging etc.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cloth-changing person re-identification (re-ID) is a new rising research
topic that aims at retrieving pedestrians whose clothes are changed. This task
is quite challenging and has not been fully studied to date. Current works
mainly focus on body shape or contour sketch, but they are not robust enough
due to view and posture variations. The key to this task is to exploit
cloth-irrelevant cues. This paper proposes a semantic-guided pixel sampling
approach for the cloth-changing person re-ID task. We do not explicitly define
which feature to extract but force the model to automatically learn
cloth-irrelevant cues. Specifically, we first recognize the pedestrian's upper
clothes and pants, then randomly change them by sampling pixels from other
pedestrians. The changed samples retain the identity labels but exchange the
pixels of clothes or pants among different pedestrians. Besides, we adopt a
loss function to constrain the learned features to keep consistent before and
after changes. In this way, the model is forced to learn cues that are
irrelevant to upper clothes and pants. We conduct extensive experiments on the
latest released PRCC dataset. Our method achieved 65.8% on Rank1 accuracy,
which outperforms previous methods with a large margin. The code is available
at https://github.com/shuxjweb/pixel_sampling.git.]]></summary>

across different camera views. Training a convolutional neural network (CNN)
for this task requires annotating a large dataset, and hence, it involves the
time-consuming manual matching of people across cameras. To reduce the need for
labeled data, we focus on a semi-supervised approach that requires only a
subset of the training data to be labeled. We conduct a comprehensive survey in
the area of person re-identification with limited labels. Existing works in
this realm are limited in the sense that they utilize features from multiple
CNNs and require the number of identities in the unlabeled data to be known. To
overcome these limitations, we propose to employ part-based features from a
single CNN without requiring the knowledge of the label space (i.e., the number
of identities). This makes our approach more suitable for practical scenarios,
and it significantly reduces the need for computational resources. We also
propose a PartMixUp loss that improves the discriminative ability of learned
part-based features for pseudo-labeling in semi-supervised settings. Our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art results on three large-scale person re-id
datasets and achieves the same level of performance as fully supervised methods
with only one-third of labeled identities.]]></summary>

Bidirectional LSTM is responsible to explore the relationships between the

responses of unrelated background regions and magnify responses of salient
regions progressively. Besides, the attention in bidirectional LSTM takes into

features in segmentation improvement, which can in turn adjust proper weights
for these two kinds of features. We conduct experiments on liver CT image data

ActivityNet workshop at CVPR 2021. This challenge focuses on recognizing
real-world low-resolution activities present in videos. Action recognition task
is currently focused around classifying the actions from high-quality videos
where the actors and the action is clearly visible. While various approaches
have been shown effective for recognition task in recent works, they often do
not deal with videos of lower resolution where the action is happening in a
tiny region. However, many real world security videos often have the actual
action captured in a small resolution, making action recognition in a tiny
region a challenging task. In this work, we propose a benchmark dataset,
TinyVIRAT-v2, which is comprised of naturally occuring low-resolution actions.
This is an extension of the TinyVIRAT dataset and consists of actions with
multiple labels. The videos are extracted from security videos which makes them
realistic and more challenging. We use current state-of-the-art action
recognition methods on the dataset as a benchmark, and propose the TinyAction

representation learning and clustering. Our method consists of two heads that
share the same backbone network - a "representation learning" head and a

patterns of objects at the instance level which serve as clues for the
"clustering" head to extract coarse-grain information that separates objects
into clusters. The whole model is trained in an end-to-end manner by minimizing
the weighted sum of two sample-oriented contrastive losses applied to the
outputs of the two heads. To ensure that the contrastive loss corresponding to
the "clustering" head is optimal, we introduce a novel critic function called
"log-of-dot-product". Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art single-stage clustering
methods across a variety of image datasets, improving over the best baseline by
about 5-7% in accuracy on CIFAR10/20, STL10, and ImageNet-Dogs. Further, the

application in safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS). One source of
uncertainty arises from distribution shifts in the input data between training
and test scenarios. Detecting such distribution shifts in real-time is an
emerging approach to address the challenge. The high dimensional input space in
CPS applications involving imaging adds extra difficulty to the task.
Generative learning models are widely adopted for the task, namely
out-of-distribution (OoD) detection. To improve the state-of-the-art, we
studied existing proposals from both machine learning and CPS fields. In the
latter, safety monitoring in real-time for autonomous driving agents has been a
focus. Exploiting the spatiotemporal correlation of motion in videos, we can
robustly detect hazardous motion around autonomous driving agents. Inspired by
the latest advances in the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) theory and practice,
we tapped into the prior knowledge in data to further boost OoD detection's
robustness. Comparison studies over nuScenes and Synthia data sets show our
methods significantly improve detection capabilities of OoD factors unique to
driving scenarios, 42% better than state-of-the-art approaches. Our model also
generalized near-perfectly, 97% better than the state-of-the-art across the
real-world and simulation driving data sets experimented. Finally, we
customized one proposed method into a twin-encoder model that can be deployed
to resource limited embedded devices for real-time OoD detection. Its execution
time was reduced over four times in low-precision 8-bit integer inference,
while detection capability is comparable to its corresponding floating-point

$\sum_{\{u,v\}\in E}|\pi(u) - \pi(v)|$. In that setting, vertices are often
assumed to lie on a horizontal line and edges are drawn as semicircles above
said line. For trees, various algorithms are available to solve the problem in
polynomial time in $n=|V|$. There exist variants of the MLA in which the
arrangements are constrained. Iordanskii, and later Hochberg and Stallmann
(HS), put forward $O(n)$-time algorithms that solve the problem when
arrangements are constrained to be planar (also known as one-page book
embeddings). We also consider linear arrangements of rooted trees that are
constrained to be projective (planar embeddings where the root is not covered
by any edge). Gildea and Temperley (GT) sketched an algorithm for projective
arrangements which they claimed runs in $O(n)$ but did not provide any
justification of its cost. In contrast, Park and Levy claimed that GT's
algorithm runs in $O(n \log d_{max})$ where $d_{max}$ is the maximum degree but
did not provide sufficient detail. Here we correct an error in HS's algorithm
for the planar case, show its relationship with the projective case, and derive
simple algorithms for the projective and planar cases that run undoubtlessly in
$O(n)$-time.]]></summary>

vision and language, having many real-life applications in video retrieval,
video surveillance, assisting visually challenged people, Human-machine
interface, and many more. Recent deep learning-based methods have shown
promising results but are still on the lower side than other vision tasks (such
as image classification, object detection). A significant drawback with
existing video captioning methods is that they are optimized over cross-entropy
loss function, which is uncorrelated to the de facto evaluation metrics (BLEU,
METEOR, CIDER, ROUGE).In other words, cross-entropy is not a proper surrogate
of the true loss function for video captioning. This paper addresses the
drawback by introducing a dynamic loss network (DLN), which provides an
additional feedback signal that directly reflects the evaluation metrics. Our
results on Microsoft Research Video Description Corpus (MSVD) and MSR-Video to
Text (MSRVTT) datasets outperform previous methods.]]></summary>

where the events are generally sparse and non-uniform and have the microsecond
temporal resolution, is of great value and has various real-life applications.
Spiking neural network (SNN), as one of the brain-inspired event-triggered
computing models, has the potential to extract effective spatio-temporal
features from the event streams. However, when aggregating individual events
into frames with a new higher temporal resolution, existing SNN models do not
attach importance to that the serial frames have different signal-to-noise
ratios since event streams are sparse and non-uniform. This situation
interferes with the performance of existing SNNs. In this work, we propose a
temporal-wise attention SNN (TA-SNN) model to learn frame-based representation
for processing event streams. Concretely, we extend the attention concept to
temporal-wise input to judge the significance of frames for the final decision
at the training stage, and discard the irrelevant frames at the inference
stage. We demonstrate that TA-SNN models improve the accuracy of event streams
classification tasks. We also study the impact of multiple-scale temporal
resolutions for frame-based representation. Our approach is tested on three
different classification tasks: gesture recognition, image classification, and
spoken digit recognition. We report the state-of-the-art results on these
tasks, and get the essential improvement of accuracy (almost 19\%) for gesture
recognition with only 60 ms.]]></summary>

segmentation problem in remote sensing images (RSIs), which aims at predicting
the categories of all instances and localizing them with pixel-level masks.
Although many landmark frameworks have demonstrated promising performance in
instance segmentation, the complexity in the background and scale variability
instances still remain challenging for instance segmentation of RSIs. To
address the above problems, we propose an end-to-end multi-category instance
segmentation model, namely Semantic Attention and Scale Complementary Network,
which mainly consists of a Semantic Attention (SEA) module and a Scale
Complementary Mask Branch (SCMB). The SEA module contains a simple fully
convolutional semantic segmentation branch with extra supervision to strengthen
the activation of interest instances on the feature map and reduce the
background noise's interference. To handle the under-segmentation of geospatial
instances with large varying scales, we design the SCMB that extends the
original single mask branch to trident mask branches and introduces
complementary mask supervision at different scales to sufficiently leverage the
multi-scale information. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the
effectiveness of our proposed method on the iSAID dataset and the NWPU Instance

To address it, current methods either deploy pose-specific models or frontalize
faces by additional modules. Still, they ignore the fact that identity
information should be consistent across poses and are not realizing the data
imbalance between frontal and profile face images during training. In this
paper, we propose an efficient PoseFace framework which utilizes the facial
landmarks to disentangle the pose-invariant features and exploits a

mask, and to generate the intermediate 3D information encoding, followed by a
coarse-to-fine learning paradigm and a self-supervised learning strategy.

for the classification of mammogram images can help in improving the accuracy,
reliability, and cost of diagnosing patients. However, training a deep learning
model requires a considerable amount of labeled images, which can be expensive
to obtain as time and effort from clinical practitioners is required. A number
of publicly available datasets have been built with data from different
hospitals and clinics. However, using models trained on these datasets for
later work on images sampled from a different hospital or clinic might result
in lower performance. This is due to the distribution mismatch of the datasets,
which include different patient populations and image acquisition protocols.
The scarcity of labeled data can also bring a challenge towards the application
of transfer learning with models trained using these source datasets. In this
work, a real world scenario is evaluated where a novel target dataset sampled
from a private Costa Rican clinic is used, with few labels and heavily
imbalanced data. The use of two popular and publicly available datasets
(INbreast and CBIS-DDSM) as source data, to train and test the models on the
novel target dataset, is evaluated. The use of the semi-supervised deep
learning approach known as MixMatch, to leverage the usage of unlabeled data
from the target dataset, is proposed and evaluated. In the tests, the
performance of models is extensively measured, using different metrics to
assess the performance of a classifier under heavy data imbalance conditions.
It is shown that the use of semi-supervised deep learning combined with
fine-tuning can provide a meaningful advantage when using scarce labeled
observations. We make available the novel dataset for the benefit of the
community.]]></summary>

deep object detection and instance segmentation methods (i.e. visual
detectors). RS Loss supervises the classifier, a sub-network of these methods,
to rank each positive above all negatives as well as to sort positives among
themselves with respect to (wrt.) their continuous localisation qualities (e.g.
Intersection-over-Union - IoU). To tackle the non-differentiable nature of
ranking and sorting, we reformulate the incorporation of error-driven update
with backpropagation as Identity Update, which enables us to model our novel
sorting error among positives. With RS Loss, we significantly simplify
training: (i) Thanks to our sorting objective, the positives are prioritized by
the classifier without an additional auxiliary head (e.g. for centerness, IoU,
mask-IoU), (ii) due to its ranking-based nature, RS Loss is robust to class
imbalance, and thus, no sampling heuristic is required, and (iii) we address
the multi-task nature of visual detectors using tuning-free task-balancing
coefficients. Using RS Loss, we train seven diverse visual detectors only by
tuning the learning rate, and show that it consistently outperforms baselines:
e.g. our RS Loss improves (i) Faster R-CNN by ~ 3 box AP and aLRP Loss
(ranking-based baseline) by ~ 2 box AP on COCO dataset, (ii) Mask R-CNN with

an intuitive alternative to probabilistic topic models. We present in detail a

that can be used for changing the targeted topic granularity. We also establish
a term ranking and use semantic word-embedding for presenting term communities
in a way that facilitates their interpretation. We demonstrate the application
of our method with a widely used corpus of general news articles and show the

representation learning on documents that naturally occur as graphs, e.g.,
citation or social networks. However, sensitive personal information, such as
documents with people's profiles or relationships as edges, are prone to
privacy leaks, as the trained model might reveal the original input. Although
differential privacy (DP) offers a well-founded privacy-preserving framework,
GCNs pose theoretical and practical challenges due to their training specifics.
We address these challenges by adapting differentially-private gradient-based
training to GCNs and conduct experiments using two optimizers on five NLP
datasets in two languages. We propose a simple yet efficient method based on
random graph splits that not only improves the baseline privacy bounds by a
factor of 2.7 while retaining competitive F1 scores, but also provides strong
privacy guarantees of epsilon = 1.0. We show that, under certain modeling
choices, privacy-preserving GCNs perform up to 90% of their non-private
variants, while formally guaranteeing strong privacy measures.]]></summary>

unprecedented impacts to people's daily life around the world. Various measures
and policies such as lockdown and social-distancing are implemented by
governments to combat the disease during the pandemic period. These measures
and policies as well as virus itself may cause different mental health issues
to people such as depression, anxiety, sadness, etc. In this paper, we exploit
the massive text data posted by Twitter users to analyse the sentiment dynamics
of people living in the state of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia during the
pandemic period. Different from the existing work that mostly focuses the
country-level and static sentiment analysis, we analyse the sentiment dynamics
at the fine-grained local government areas (LGAs). Based on the analysis of
around 94 million tweets that posted by around 183 thousand users located at
different LGAs in NSW in five months, we found that people in NSW showed an
overall positive sentimental polarity and the COVID-19 pandemic decreased the
overall positive sentimental polarity during the pandemic period. The
fine-grained analysis of sentiment in LGAs found that despite the dominant
positive sentiment most of days during the study period, some LGAs experienced
significant sentiment changes from positive to negative. This study also
analysed the sentimental dynamics delivered by the hot topics in Twitter such
as government policies (e.g. the Australia's JobKeeper program, lockdown,
social-distancing) as well as the focused social events (e.g. the Ruby Princess
Cruise). The results showed that the policies and events did affect people's
overall sentiment, and they affected people's overall sentiment differently at
different stages.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Social media is increasingly used for large-scale population predictions,
such as estimating community health statistics. However, social media users are
not typically a representative sample of the intended population -- a
"selection bias". Within the social sciences, such a bias is typically
addressed with restratification techniques, where observations are reweighted
according to how under- or over-sampled their socio-demographic groups are.
Yet, restratifaction is rarely evaluated for improving prediction. Across four
tasks of predicting U.S. county population health statistics from Twitter, we
find standard restratification techniques provide no improvement and often
degrade prediction accuracies. The core reasons for this seems to be both
shrunken estimates (reduced variance of model predicted values) and sparse
estimates of each population's socio-demographics. We thus develop and evaluate
three methods to address these problems: estimator redistribution to account
for shrinking, and adaptive binning and informed smoothing to handle sparse
socio-demographic estimates. We show that each of these methods significantly
outperforms the standard restratification approaches. Combining approaches, we
find substantial improvements over non-restratified models, yielding a 53.0%
increase in predictive accuracy (R^2) in the case of surveyed life
satisfaction, and a 17.8% average increase across all tasks.]]></summary>

(BNLP) is still lagging behind mainly due to the scarcity of resources and the

however, a thorough survey reporting previous work and recent advances is yet
to be done. In this study, we first provide a review of Bangla NLP tasks,
resources, and tools available to the research community; we benchmark datasets
collected from various platforms for nine NLP tasks using current
state-of-the-art algorithms (i.e., transformer-based models). We provide
comparative results for the studied NLP tasks by comparing monolingual vs.
multilingual models of varying sizes. We report our results using both
individual and consolidated datasets and provide data splits for future
research. We reviewed a total of 108 papers and conducted 175 sets of
experiments. Our results show promising performance using transformer-based

provide platforms for empowering freedom of expressions and individual voices,
but also enables people to express anti-social behavior like online harassment,
cyberbullying, and hate speech. Numerous works have been proposed to utilize
textual data for social and anti-social behavior analysis, by predicting the
contexts mostly for highly-resourced languages like English. However, some
languages are under-resourced, e.g., South Asian languages like Bengali, that
lack computational resources for accurate natural language processing (NLP). In
this paper, we propose an explainable approach for hate speech detection from
the under-resourced Bengali language, which we called DeepHateExplainer.
Bengali texts are first comprehensively preprocessed, before classifying them
into political, personal, geopolitical, and religious hates using a neural
ensemble method of transformer-based neural architectures (i.e., monolingual
Bangla BERT-base, multilingual BERT-cased/uncased, and XLM-RoBERTa).
Important~(most and least) terms are then identified using sensitivity analysis
and layer-wise relevance propagation~(LRP), before providing
human-interpretable explanations. Finally, we compute comprehensiveness and
sufficiency scores to measure the quality of explanations w.r.t faithfulness.
Evaluations against machine learning~(linear and tree-based models) and neural
networks (i.e., CNN, Bi-LSTM, and Conv-LSTM with word embeddings) baselines
yield F1-scores of 78%, 91%, 89%, and 84%, for political, personal,
geopolitical, and religious hates, respectively, outperforming both ML and DNN
baselines.]]></summary>

problem between the language of healthcare professionals, and that of the
general public. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of automated
generation of lay language summaries of biomedical scientific reviews, and
construct a dataset to support the development and evaluation of automated
methods through which to enhance the accessibility of the biomedical
literature. We conduct analyses of the various challenges in solving this task,
including not only summarization of the key points but also explanation of
background knowledge and simplification of professional language. We experiment
with state-of-the-art summarization models as well as several data augmentation
techniques, and evaluate their performance using both automated metrics and
human assessment. Results indicate that automatically generated summaries
produced using contemporary neural architectures can achieve promising quality
and readability as compared with reference summaries developed for the lay
public by experts (best ROUGE-L of 50.24 and Flesch-Kincaid readability score
of 13.30). We also discuss the limitations of the current attempt, providing

order - one of the most important characteristics of a sequence? Not always! We
found 75% to 90% of the correct predictions of BERT-based classifiers, trained
on many GLUE tasks, remain constant after input words are randomly shuffled.
Despite BERT embeddings are famously contextual, the contribution of each
individual word to downstream tasks is almost unchanged even after the word's
context is shuffled. BERT-based models are able to exploit superficial cues
(e.g. the sentiment of keywords in sentiment analysis; or the word-wise
similarity between sequence-pair inputs in natural language inference) to make
correct decisions when tokens are arranged in random orders. Encouraging
classifiers to capture word order information improves the performance on most
GLUE tasks, SQuAD 2.0 and out-of-samples. Our work suggests that many GLUE
tasks are not challenging machines to understand the meaning of a sentence.]]></summary>

historical phonology of West Iranian languages. The West Iranian languages
(Persian, Kurdish, Balochi, and other languages) display a high degree of
non-Lautgesetzlich behavior. Most of this irregularity is undoubtedly due to
language contact; we argue, however, that an oversimplified view of the
processes at work has prevailed in the literature on West Iranian dialectology,
with specialists assuming that deviations from an expected outcome in a given
non-Persian language are due to lexical borrowing from some chronological stage
of Persian. It is demonstrated that this qualitative approach yields at times
problematic conclusions stemming from the lack of explicit probabilistic
inferences regarding the distribution of the data: Persian may not be the sole
donor language; additionally, borrowing at the lexical level is not always the
mechanism that introduces irregularity. In many cases, the possibility that
West Iranian languages show different reflexes in different conditioning
environments remains under-explored. We employ a novel Bayesian approach
designed to overcome these problems and tease apart the different determinants
of irregularity in patterns of West Iranian sound change. Our methodology
allows us to provisionally resolve a number of outstanding questions in the
literature on West Iranian dialectology concerning the dialectal affiliation of
certain sound changes. We outline future directions for work of this sort.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is the most recent subtask of ABSA
which outputs triplets of an aspect target, its associated sentiment, and the
corresponding opinion term. Recent models perform the triplet extraction in an
end-to-end manner but heavily rely on the interactions between each target word
and opinion word. Thereby, they cannot perform well on targets and opinions
which contain multiple words. Our proposed span-level approach explicitly
considers the interaction between the whole spans of targets and opinions when
predicting their sentiment relation. Thus, it can make predictions with the
semantics of whole spans, ensuring better sentiment consistency. To ease the
high computational cost caused by span enumeration, we propose a dual-channel
span pruning strategy by incorporating supervision from the Aspect Term
Extraction (ATE) and Opinion Term Extraction (OTE) tasks. This strategy not
only improves computational efficiency but also distinguishes the opinion and
target spans more properly. Our framework simultaneously achieves strong
performance for the ASTE as well as ATE and OTE tasks. In particular, our
analysis shows that our span-level approach achieves more significant
improvements over the baselines on triplets with multi-word targets or
opinions.]]></summary>

manually, in English--German (EN--DE) and English--Chinese (EN--ZH). We show
that the ability of neural machine translation (NMT) models to translate
negation has improved with deeper and more advanced networks, although the
performance varies between language pairs and translation directions. The
accuracy of manual evaluation in EN-DE, DE-EN, EN-ZH, and ZH-EN is 95.7%,
94.8%, 93.4%, and 91.7%, respectively. In addition, we show that
under-translation is the most significant error type in NMT, which contrasts
with the more diverse error profile previously observed for statistical machine
translation. To better understand the root of the under-translation of
negation, we study the model's information flow and training data. While our
information flow analysis does not reveal any deficiencies that could be used
to detect or fix the under-translation of negation, we find that negation is
often rephrased during training, which could make it more difficult for the
model to learn a reliable link between source and target negation. We finally
conduct intrinsic analysis and extrinsic probing tasks on negation, showing
that NMT models can distinguish negation and non-negation tokens very well and
encode a lot of information about negation in hidden states but nevertheless
leave room for improvement.]]></summary>

RNNs, GNNs and other deep learning models for detecting secret information in
generative texts. These methods tend to seek stronger feature extractors to
achieve higher steganalysis effects. However, we have found through experiments
that there actually exists significant difference between automatically
generated steganographic texts and carrier texts in terms of the conditional
probability distribution of individual words. Such kind of statistical
difference can be naturally captured by the language model used for generating
steganographic texts, which drives us to give the classifier a priori knowledge
of the language model to enhance the steganalysis ability. To this end, we
present two methods to efficient linguistic steganalysis in this paper. One is
to pre-train a language model based on RNN, and the other is to pre-train a
sequence autoencoder. Experimental results show that the two methods have
different degrees of performance improvement when compared to the randomly
initialized RNN classifier, and the convergence speed is significantly
accelerated. Moreover, our methods have achieved the best detection results.]]></summary>

this translation is isomorphic on the level of string languages. The basic
ingredient are tensor terms, which can be seen as encoding and generalizing
proof-nets. Using tensor terms makes the syntax extremely simple and a direct
geometric meaning becomes transparent. Then we address the problem of encoding
noncommutative operations in our setting. This turns out possible after
enriching the system with new unary operators. The resulting system allows
representing both ACG and Lambek grammars as conservative fragments, while the

the fact that dense synthesizer attention (DSA), which dispenses with dot
products and pairwise interactions, achieved competitive results in many
language processing tasks, in this paper, we first propose a DSA-based speech
recognition, as an alternative to SA. To reduce the computational complexity
and improve the performance, we further propose local DSA (LDSA) to restrict
the attention scope of DSA to a local range around the current central frame
for speech recognition. Finally, we combine LDSA with SA to extract the local

Mandarine speech recognition corpus show that the proposed LDSA-Transformer
achieves a character error rate (CER) of 6.49%, which is slightly better than
that of the SA-Transformer. Meanwhile, the LDSA-Transformer requires less
computation than the SATransformer. The proposed combination method not only
achieves a CER of 6.18%, which significantly outperforms the SA-Transformer,
but also has roughly the same number of parameters and computational complexity
as the latter. The implementation of the multi-head LDSA is available at

right-away. Instead, they start with an intuitive decision, reflect upon it,
spot mistakes, resolve contradictions and jump between different hypotheses.
Thus, they create a sequence of ideas and follow a train of thought that
ultimately reaches a conclusive decision. Contrary to this, today's neural
classification models are mostly trained to map an input to one single and
fixed output. In this paper, we investigate how we can give models the
opportunity of a second, third and $k$-th thought. We take inspiration from
Hegel's dialectics and propose a method that turns an existing classifier's
class prediction (such as the image class forest) into a sequence of
predictions (such as forest $\rightarrow$ tree $\rightarrow$ mushroom).
Concretely, we propose a correction module that is trained to estimate the
model's correctness as well as an iterative prediction update based on the
prediction's gradient. Our approach results in a dynamic system over class
probability distributions $\unicode{x2014}$ the thought flow. We evaluate our
method on diverse datasets and tasks from computer vision and natural language
processing. We observe surprisingly complex but intuitive behavior and
demonstrate that our method (i) can correct misclassifications, (ii)
strengthens model performance, (iii) is robust to high levels of adversarial
attacks, (iv) can increase accuracy up to 4% in a label-distribution-shift
setting and (iv) provides a tool for model interpretability that uncovers model
knowledge which otherwise remains invisible in a single distribution
prediction.]]></summary>

in introducing and selecting useful information for weakly supervised methods.
However, only qualitative analysis and ablation study are provided as evidence.
In this paper, we contribute a dataset and propose a paradigm to quantitatively
evaluate the effect of attention and KG on bag-level relation extraction (RE).
We find that (1) higher attention accuracy may lead to worse performance as it
may harm the model's ability to extract entity mention features; (2) the
performance of attention is largely influenced by various noise distribution
patterns, which is closely related to real-world datasets; (3) KG-enhanced
attention indeed improves RE performance, while not through enhanced attention
but by incorporating entity prior; and (4) attention mechanism may exacerbate
the issue of insufficient training data. Based on these findings, we show that
a straightforward variant of RE model can achieve significant improvements (6%
AUC on average) on two real-world datasets as compared with three
state-of-the-art baselines. Our codes and datasets are available at

the two agents on a collection of source domain dialogues, which equips the
agents to converse with each other via natural language. With further
fine-tuning on a small amount of target domain data, the agents continue to
interact with the aim of improving their behaviors using reinforcement learning
with structured reward functions. In experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, two
practical transfer learning problems are investigated: 1) domain adaptation and
2) single-to-multiple domain transfer. We demonstrate that the proposed

various applications, the graph convolutional layers, as the most important
component of GCN, are still using linear transformations and a simple pooling
step. In this paper, we propose a novel generalization of Factorized Bilinear
(FB) layer to model the feature interactions in GCNs. FB performs two
matrix-vector multiplications, that is, the weight matrix is multiplied with
the outer product of the vector of hidden features from both sides. However,
the FB layer suffers from the quadratic number of coefficients, overfitting and
the spurious correlations due to correlations between channels of hidden
representations that violate the i.i.d. assumption. Thus, we propose a compact
FB layer by defining a family of summarizing operators applied over the
quadratic term. We analyze proposed pooling operators and motivate their use.
Our experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that the GFB-GCN is

challenging task for evaluating complex multi-hop and abductive inference
capabilities. In this setting, Transformers trained on human-annotated
explanations achieve state-of-the-art performance when adopted as cross-encoder
architectures. However, while much attention has been devoted to the quality of
the constructed explanations, the problem of performing abductive inference at
scale is still under-studied. As intrinsically not scalable, the cross-encoder
architectural paradigm is not suitable for efficient multi-hop inference on
massive facts banks. To maximise both accuracy and inference time, we propose a
hybrid abductive solver that autoregressively combines a dense bi-encoder with
a sparse model of explanatory power, computed leveraging explicit patterns in
the explanations. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can
achieve performance comparable with the state-of-the-art cross-encoder while
being $\approx 50$ times faster and scalable to corpora of millions of facts.
Moreover, we study the impact of the hybridisation on semantic drift and
science question answering without additional training, showing that it boosts
the quality of the explanations and contributes to improved downstream
inference performance.]]></summary>

correct answer span in the given passage, but also to provide a chain of
supporting evidences for reasoning interpretability. It is natural to model
such a process into graph structure by understanding multi-hop reasoning as
jumping over entity nodes, which has made graph modelling dominant on this
task. Recently, there have been dissenting voices about whether graph modelling
is indispensable due to the inconvenience of the graph building, however
existing state-of-the-art graph-free attempts suffer from huge performance gap
compared to graph-based ones. This work presents a novel graph-free alternative
which firstly outperform all graph models on MHRC. In detail, we exploit a
select-to-guide (S2G) strategy to accurately retrieve evidence paragraphs in a
coarse-to-fine manner, incorporated with two novel attention mechanisms, which
surprisingly shows conforming to the nature of multi-hop reasoning. Our
graph-free model achieves significant and consistent performance gain over
strong baselines and the current new state-of-the-art on the MHRC benchmark,
HotpotQA, among all the published works.]]></summary>

However, few of previous studies focus on the controllable generation of
comments. Besides, they tend to generate dull and commonplace comments, which
further limits their practical application. In this paper, we make the first
step towards controllable generation of comments, by building a system that can
explicitly control the emotion of the generated comments. To achieve this, we
associate each kind of emotion category with an embedding and adopt a dynamic
fusion mechanism to fuse this embedding into the decoder. A sentence-level
emotion classifier is further employed to better guide the model to generate
comments expressing the desired emotion. To increase the diversity of the
generated comments, we propose a hierarchical copy mechanism that allows our
model to directly copy words from the input articles. We also propose a
restricted beam search (RBS) algorithm to increase intra-sentence diversity.
Experimental results show that our model can generate informative and diverse
comments that express the desired emotions with high accuracy.]]></summary>

this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Dynamic Copy Network (HDCN) to facilitate
focusing on the most informative turn, making it easier to extract slot values

hierarchical copy approach that calculates two levels of attention at the word-

distribution. A focus loss term is employed to encourage the model to assign
the highest turn-level attention weight to the most informative turn.

recommenders have traditionally embraced content-based (CB) approaches. In the
past years, music recommendation models that leverage collaborative and content
data -- which we refer to as content-driven models -- have been replacing pure
CF or CB models.

In this survey, we review 47 articles on content-driven music recommendation.
Based on a thorough literature analysis, we first propose an onion model
comprising five layers, each of which corresponds to a category of music
content we identified: signal, embedded metadata, expert-generated content,
user-generated content, and derivative content. We provide a detailed
characterization of each category along several dimensions. Second, we identify
six overarching challenges, according to which we organize our main discussion:
increasing recommendation diversity and novelty, providing transparency and
explanations, accomplishing context-awareness, recommending sequences of music,
improving scalability and efficiency, and alleviating cold start. Each article
addressing one or more of these challenges is categorized according to the
content layers of our onion model, the article's goal(s), and main
methodological choices. Furthermore, articles are discussed in temporal order
to shed light on the evolution of content-driven music recommendation
strategies. Finally, we provide our personal selection of the persisting grand

imitate the actions by transferring the pose from the constructed human body to

poorly with the code-mixed NLG tasks. To address this challenge, we present a

objective of minimizing the entropy loss between the training "hard" targets
and the predicted logits. Often, performance gains and improved generalization
can be achieved by using regularization techniques like label smoothing, which
converts the training "hard" targets to "soft" targets. However, label
smoothing enforces a data independent uniform distribution on the incorrect
training targets, which leads to an incorrect assumption of equi-probable
incorrect targets for each correct target. In this paper we propose and
experiment with incorporating data dependent word similarity based weighing
methods to transforms the uniform distribution of the incorrect target
probabilities in label smoothing, to a more natural distribution based on
semantics. We introduce hyperparameters to control the incorrect target
distribution, and report significant performance gains over networks trained
using standard label smoothing based loss, on two standard open domain dialogue

state-of-the-art machine translation (MT) systems are trained on large corpora
of text, mostly generated by humans, gender bias can also be found in MT. For
instance when occupations are translated from a language like English, which
mostly uses gender neutral words, to a language like German, which mostly uses
a feminine and a masculine version for an occupation, a decision must be made
by the MT System. Recent research showed that MT systems are biased towards
stereotypical translation of occupations. In 2019 the first, and so far only,
challenge set, explicitly designed to measure the extent of gender bias in MT
systems has been published. In this set measurement of gender bias is solely
based on the translation of occupations. In this paper we present an extension
of this challenge set, called WiBeMT, with gender-biased adjectives and adds
sentences with gender-biased verbs. The resulting challenge set consists of
over 70, 000 sentences and has been translated with three commercial MT
systems: DeepL Translator, Microsoft Translator, and Google Translate. Results
show a gender bias for all three MT systems. This gender bias is to a great
extent significantly influenced by adjectives and to a lesser extent by verbs.]]></summary>

into two steps. First, we equip Transformer decoders with the ability to accept

Subsequently, we combine the developed and tested in-attention decoder with a
Transformer encoder, and train the resulting MuseMorphose model with the VAE
objective to achieve style transfer of long musical pieces, in which users can
specify musical attributes including rhythmic intensity and polyphony (i.e.,

context sentence information where the word appears, we think it's also
important to dynamically refine each feature's embedding layer by layer
according to the context information contained in input instance in CTR
estimation tasks. We can effectively capture the useful feature interactions
for each feature in this way. In this paper, We propose a novel CTR Framework
named ContextNet that implicitly models high-order feature interactions by
dynamically refining each feature's embedding according to the input context.
Specifically, ContextNet consists of two key components: contextual embedding
module and ContextNet block. Contextual embedding module aggregates contextual
information for each feature from input instance and ContextNet block maintains
each feature's embedding layer by layer and dynamically refines its
representation by merging contextual high-order interaction information into
feature embedding. To make the framework specific, we also propose two
models(ContextNet-PFFN and ContextNet-SFFN) under this framework by introducing
linear contextual embedding network and two non-linear mapping sub-network in
ContextNet block. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets

advertising and recommender systems. Though many models have been proposed such
as FM, FFM and DeepFM in recent years, feature engineering is still a very
important way to improve the model performance in many applications because
using raw features can rarely lead to optimal results. For example, the
continuous features are usually transformed to the power forms by adding a new
feature to allow it to easily form non-linear functions of the feature.
However, this kind of feature engineering heavily relies on peoples experience
and it is both time consuming and labor consuming. On the other side, concise
CTR model with both fast online serving speed and good model performance is
critical for many real life applications. In this paper, we propose LeafFM
model based on FM to generate new features from the original feature embedding
by learning the transformation functions automatically. We also design three
concrete Leaf-FM models according to the different strategies of combing the
original and the generated features. Extensive experiments are conducted on
three real-world datasets and the results show Leaf-FM model outperforms

significantly better performance with much less parameters. In Avazu and
Malware dataset, add version Leaf-FM achieves comparable performance with some
deep learning based models such as DNN and AutoInt. As an improved FM model,
Leaf-FM has the same computation complexity with FM in online serving phase and
it means Leaf-FM is applicable in many industry applications because of its
better performance and high computation efficiency.]]></summary>

advances in streaming such videos have become a popular research topic.
However, streaming 360{\deg} videos require high bandwidth, thus escalating the
need for developing optimized streaming algorithms. Researchers have proposed
various methods to tackle the problem, considering the network bandwidth or
attempt to predict future viewports in advance. However, most of the existing
works either (1) do not consider video contents to predict user viewport, or
(2) do not adapt to user preferences dynamically, or (3) require a lot of
training data for new videos, thus making them potentially unfit for video
streaming purposes. We develop PARIMA, a fast and efficient online viewport
prediction model that uses past viewports of users along with the trajectories
of prime objects as a representative of video content to predict future
viewports. We claim that the head movement of a user majorly depends upon the
trajectories of the prime objects in the video. We employ a pyramid-based
bitrate allocation scheme and perform a comprehensive evaluation of the
performance of PARIMA. In our evaluation, we show that PARIMA outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches, improving the Quality of Experience by over 30\%
while maintaining a short response time.]]></summary>

tasks in many real-world applications and it's important for ranking models to
effectively capture complex high-order features. Shallow feed-forward network
is widely used in many state-of-the-art DNN models such as FNN, DeepFM and
xDeepFM to implicitly capture high-order feature interactions. However, some
research has proved that addictive feature interaction, particular feed-forward
neural networks, is inefficient in capturing common feature interaction. To
resolve this problem, we introduce specific multiplicative operation into DNN
ranking system by proposing instance-guided mask which performs element-wise
product both on the feature embedding and feed-forward layers guided by input
instance. We also turn the feed-forward layer in DNN model into a mixture of
addictive and multiplicative feature interactions by proposing MaskBlock in
this paper. MaskBlock combines the layer normalization, instance-guided mask,
and feed-forward layer and it is a basic building block to be used to design
new ranking model under various configurations. The model consisting of
MaskBlock is called MaskNet in this paper and two new MaskNet models are
proposed to show the effectiveness of MaskBlock as basic building block for
composing high performance ranking systems. The experiment results on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed MaskNet models outperform
state-of-the-art models such as DeepFM and xDeepFM significantly, which implies
MaskBlock is an effective basic building unit for composing new high
performance ranking systems.]]></summary>

challenging task for evaluating complex multi-hop and abductive inference
capabilities. In this setting, Transformers trained on human-annotated
explanations achieve state-of-the-art performance when adopted as cross-encoder
architectures. However, while much attention has been devoted to the quality of
the constructed explanations, the problem of performing abductive inference at
scale is still under-studied. As intrinsically not scalable, the cross-encoder
architectural paradigm is not suitable for efficient multi-hop inference on
massive facts banks. To maximise both accuracy and inference time, we propose a
hybrid abductive solver that autoregressively combines a dense bi-encoder with
a sparse model of explanatory power, computed leveraging explicit patterns in
the explanations. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can
achieve performance comparable with the state-of-the-art cross-encoder while
being $\approx 50$ times faster and scalable to corpora of millions of facts.
Moreover, we study the impact of the hybridisation on semantic drift and
science question answering without additional training, showing that it boosts
the quality of the explanations and contributes to improved downstream
inference performance.]]></summary>

Swahili-English direction and got the best scareBLEU (25.3) score among all the
participants. Our constrained system is based on a pipeline framework, i.e. ASR
and NMT. We trained our models with the officially provided ASR and MT
datasets. The ASR system is based on the open-sourced tool Kaldi and this work
mainly explores how to make the most of the NMT models. To reduce the
punctuation errors generated by the ASR model, we employ our previous work
SlotRefine to train a punctuation correction model. To achieve better
translation performance, we explored the most recent effective strategies,
including back translation, knowledge distillation, multi-feature reranking and
transductive finetuning. For model structure, we tried auto-regressive and
non-autoregressive models, respectively. In addition, we proposed two novel
pre-train approaches, i.e. \textit{de-noising training} and
\textit{bidirectional training} to fully exploit the data. Extensive
experiments show that adding the above techniques consistently improves the
BLEU scores, and the final submission system outperforms the baseline
(Transformer ensemble model trained with the original parallel data) by
approximately 10.8 BLEU score, achieving the SOTA performance.]]></summary>

Experience from other online communities and peer-production systems, including
Wikipedia, suggests that personalised recommendations could help, especially
newcomers, who are sometimes unsure about how to contribute best to an ongoing

item-based representations and optimize them with editor-based representation
by item-editor interaction. To facilitate further research in this space, we
also create two benchmark datasets, a general-purpose one with 220,000 editors
responsible for 14 million interactions with 4 million items and a second one
focusing on the contributions of more than 8,000 more active editors. We
perform an offline evaluation of the system on both datasets with promising

recent years, but it is still challenging to enable VQA models to adaptively
generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Intuitively, recompositions of
existing visual concepts (i.e., attributes and objects) can generate unseen
compositions in the training set, which will promote VQA models to generalize
to OOD samples. In this paper, we formulate OOD generalization in VQA as a
compositional generalization problem and propose a graph generative
modeling-based training scheme (X-GGM) to handle the problem implicitly. X-GGM
leverages graph generative modeling to iteratively generate a relation matrix
and node representations for the predefined graph that utilizes
attribute-object pairs as nodes. Furthermore, to alleviate the unstable
training issue in graph generative modeling, we propose a gradient distribution
consistency loss to constrain the data distribution with adversarial
perturbations and the generated distribution. The baseline VQA model (LXMERT)
trained with the X-GGM scheme achieves state-of-the-art OOD performance on two
standard VQA OOD benchmarks, i.e., VQA-CP v2 and GQA-OOD. Extensive ablation

achieve higher steganalysis effects. However, we have found through experiments
that there actually exists significant difference between automatically

probability distribution of individual words. Such kind of statistical
difference can be naturally captured by the language model used for generating
steganographic texts, which drives us to give the classifier a priori knowledge
of the language model to enhance the steganalysis ability. To this end, we
present two methods to efficient linguistic steganalysis in this paper. One is
to pre-train a language model based on RNN, and the other is to pre-train a
sequence autoencoder. Experimental results show that the two methods have
different degrees of performance improvement when compared to the randomly

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One crucial aspect of sentiment analysis is negation handling, where the
occurrence of negation can flip the sentiment of a sentence and negatively
affects the machine learning-based sentiment classification. The role of
negation in Arabic sentiment analysis has been explored only to a limited
extent, especially for colloquial Arabic. In this paper, the author addresses
the negation problem of machine learning-based sentiment classification for a
colloquial Arabic language. To this end, we propose a simple rule-based
algorithm for handling the problem; the rules were crafted based on observing
many cases of negation. Additionally, simple linguistic knowledge and sentiment
lexicon are used for this purpose. The author also examines the impact of the
proposed algorithm on the performance of different machine learning algorithms.
The results given by the proposed algorithm are compared with three baseline
models. The experimental results show that there is a positive impact on the
classifiers accuracy, precision and recall when the proposed algorithm is used
compared to the baselines.]]></summary>

systems technology. In contrast to most other recommendation domains, which
predominantly rely on collaborative filtering (CF) techniques, music
recommenders have traditionally embraced content-based (CB) approaches. In the
past years, music recommendation models that leverage collaborative and content
data -- which we refer to as content-driven models -- have been replacing pure
CF or CB models.

In this survey, we review 47 articles on content-driven music recommendation.
Based on a thorough literature analysis, we first propose an onion model
comprising five layers, each of which corresponds to a category of music
content we identified: signal, embedded metadata, expert-generated content,
user-generated content, and derivative content. We provide a detailed
characterization of each category along several dimensions. Second, we identify
six overarching challenges, according to which we organize our main discussion:
increasing recommendation diversity and novelty, providing transparency and
explanations, accomplishing context-awareness, recommending sequences of music,
improving scalability and efficiency, and alleviating cold start. Each article
addressing one or more of these challenges is categorized according to the
content layers of our onion model, the article's goal(s), and main
methodological choices. Furthermore, articles are discussed in temporal order
to shed light on the evolution of content-driven music recommendation
strategies. Finally, we provide our personal selection of the persisting grand
challenges, which are still waiting to be solved in future research endeavors.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, the misinformation problem has been addressed with a
crowdsourcing-based approach: to assess the truthfulness of a statement,
instead of relying on a few experts, a crowd of non-expert is exploited. We
study whether crowdsourcing is an effective and reliable method to assess
truthfulness during a pandemic, targeting statements related to COVID-19, thus
addressing (mis)information that is both related to a sensitive and personal
issue and very recent as compared to when the judgment is done. In our
experiments, crowd workers are asked to assess the truthfulness of statements,
and to provide evidence for the assessments. Besides showing that the crowd is
able to accurately judge the truthfulness of the statements, we report results
on workers behavior, agreement among workers, effect of aggregation functions,
of scales transformations, and of workers background and bias. We perform a
longitudinal study by re-launching the task multiple times with both novice and
experienced workers, deriving important insights on how the behavior and
quality change over time. Our results show that: workers are able to detect and
objectively categorize online (mis)information related to COVID-19; both
crowdsourced and expert judgments can be transformed and aggregated to improve
quality; worker background and other signals (e.g., source of information,
behavior) impact the quality of the data. The longitudinal study demonstrates
that the time-span has a major effect on the quality of the judgments, for both
novice and experienced workers. Finally, we provide an extensive failure
analysis of the statements misjudged by the crowd-workers.]]></summary>

health programs, such as taking medications and periodic health checks.
Unfortunately, beneficiaries may gradually disengage from such programs, which
is detrimental to their health. A concrete example of gradual disengagement has
been observed by an organization that carries out a free automated call-based
program for spreading preventive care information among pregnant women. Many
women stop picking up calls after being enrolled for a few months. To avoid
such disengagements, it is important to provide timely interventions. Such
interventions are often expensive and can be provided to only a small fraction
of the beneficiaries. We model this scenario as a restless multi-armed bandit
(RMAB) problem, where each beneficiary is assumed to transition from one state
to another depending on the intervention. Moreover, since the transition
probabilities are unknown a priori, we propose a Whittle index based Q-Learning
mechanism and show that it converges to the optimal solution. Our method
improves over existing learning-based methods for RMABs on multiple benchmarks
from literature and also on the maternal healthcare dataset.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There has been significant research done on developing methods for improving
robustness to distributional shift and uncertainty estimation. In contrast,
only limited work has examined developing standard datasets and benchmarks for
assessing these approaches. Additionally, most work on uncertainty estimation
and robustness has developed new techniques based on small-scale regression or
image classification tasks. However, many tasks of practical interest have
different modalities, such as tabular data, audio, text, or sensor data, which
offer significant challenges involving regression and discrete or continuous
structured prediction. Thus, given the current state of the field, a
standardized large-scale dataset of tasks across a range of modalities affected
by distributional shifts is necessary. This will enable researchers to
meaningfully evaluate the plethora of recently developed uncertainty
quantification methods, as well as assessment criteria and state-of-the-art
baselines. In this work, we propose the \emph{Shifts Dataset} for evaluation of
uncertainty estimates and robustness to distributional shift. The dataset,
which has been collected from industrial sources and services, is composed of
three tasks, with each corresponding to a particular data modality: tabular
weather prediction, machine translation, and self-driving car (SDC) vehicle
motion prediction. All of these data modalities and tasks are affected by real,
`in-the-wild' distributional shifts and pose interesting challenges with
respect to uncertainty estimation. In this work we provide a description of the
dataset and baseline results for all tasks.]]></summary>

various linguistic peculiarities present in the language. The Sanskrit language
is lexically productive, undergoes euphonic assimilation of phones at the word
boundaries and exhibits variations in spelling conventions and in
pronunciations. In this work, we propose the first large scale study of
automatic speech recognition (ASR) in Sanskrit, with an emphasis on the impact
of unit selection in Sanskrit ASR. In this work, we release a 78 hour ASR
dataset for Sanskrit, which faithfully captures several of the linguistic
characteristics expressed by the language. We investigate the role of different
acoustic model and language model units in ASR systems for Sanskrit. We also
propose a new modelling unit, inspired by the syllable level unit selection,
that captures character sequences from one vowel in the word to the next vowel.
We also highlight the importance of choosing graphemic representations for
Sanskrit and show the impact of this choice on word error rates (WER). Finally,
we extend these insights from Sanskrit ASR for building ASR systems in two
other Indic languages, Gujarati and Telugu. For both these languages, our
experimental results show that the use of phonetic based graphemic
representations in ASR results in performance improvements as compared to ASR
systems that use native scripts.]]></summary>

two multi-type (continuous and discrete) training approaches for GANs to deal
with the limitations of traditional GANs in passing the gradient updates for
discrete tokens. First, we used the Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training
approach and then, an approximation of the multinomial distribution

with interval-censored data. Such data records the aggregated counts of events
solely during specific time intervals -- such as the number of patients
admitted to the hospital or the volume of vehicles passing traffic loop
detectors -- and not the exact occurrence time of the events. First, we
establish the Mean Behavior Poisson (MBP) process, a novel Poisson process with
a direct parameter correspondence to the popular self-exciting Hawkes process.
The event intensity function of the MBP is the expected intensity over all
possible Hawkes realizations with the same parameter set. We fit MBP in the
interval-censored setting using an interval-censored Poisson log-likelihood
(IC-LL). We use the parameter equivalence to uncover the parameters of the
associated Hawkes process. Second, we introduce two novel exogenous functions
to distinguish the exogenous from the endogenous events. We propose the
multi-impulse exogenous function when the exogenous events are observed as
event time and the latent homogeneous Poisson process exogenous function when
the exogenous events are presented as interval-censored volumes. Third, we
provide several approximation methods to estimate the intensity and compensator
function of MBP when no analytical solution exists. Fourth and finally, we
connect the interval-censored loss of MBP to a broader class of Bregman

statistics of the convolutional feature. Its effectiveness has been
demonstrated in boosting the classification performance of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used in GCP to compute
the matrix square root. However, the approximate matrix square root calculated
using Newton-Schulz iteration \cite{li2018towards} outperforms the accurate one
computed via SVD \cite{li2017second}. We empirically analyze the reason behind
the performance gap from the perspectives of data precision and gradient
smoothness. Various remedies for computing smooth SVD gradients are
investigated. Based on our observation and analyses, a hybrid training protocol
is proposed for SVD-based GCP meta-layers such that competitive performances
can be achieved against Newton-Schulz iteration. Moreover, we propose a new GCP
meta-layer that uses SVD in the forward pass, and Pad\'e Approximants in the
backward propagation to compute the gradients. The proposed meta-layer has been
integrated into different CNN models and achieves state-of-the-art performances

sensory devices, produce substantial amounts of multivariate time series data.
Meanwhile, vital IoT infrastructures like smart power grids and water
distribution networks are frequently targeted by cyber-attacks, making anomaly
detection an important study topic. Modeling such relatedness is, nevertheless,
unavoidable for any efficient and effective anomaly detection system, given the
intricate topological and nonlinear connections that are originally unknown
among sensors. Furthermore, detecting anomalies in multivariate time series is
difficult due to their temporal dependency and stochasticity. This paper
presented GTA, a new framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection
that involves automatically learning a graph structure, graph convolution, and
modeling temporal dependency using a Transformer-based architecture. The
connection learning policy, which is based on the Gumbel-softmax sampling
approach to learn bi-directed links among sensors directly, is at the heart of
learning graph structure. To describe the anomaly information flow between
network nodes, we introduced a new graph convolution called Influence
Propagation convolution. In addition, to tackle the quadratic complexity
barrier, we suggested a multi-branch attention mechanism to replace the
original multi-head self-attention method. Extensive experiments on four
publicly available anomaly detection benchmarks further demonstrate the
superiority of our approach over alternative state-of-the-arts.]]></summary>

learning models in different domains. For graph-level tasks such as graph
classification, graphs can also be regarded as a special type of data samples,
which can be collected and stored in separate local systems. Similar to other
domains, multiple local systems, each holding a small set of graphs, may
benefit from collaboratively training a powerful graph mining model, such as
the popular graph neural networks (GNNs). To provide more motivation towards
such endeavors, we analyze real-world graphs from different domains to confirm
that they indeed share certain graph properties that are statistically
significant compared with random graphs. However, we also find that different
sets of graphs, even from the same domain or same dataset, are non-IID
regarding both graph structures and node features. To handle this, we propose a
graph clustered federated learning (GCFL) framework that dynamically finds
clusters of local systems based on the gradients of GNNs, and theoretically
justify that such clusters can reduce the structure and feature heterogeneity
among graphs owned by the local systems. Moreover, we observe the gradients of
GNNs to be rather fluctuating in GCFL which impedes high-quality clustering,
and design a gradient sequence-based clustering mechanism based on dynamic time
warping (GCFL+). Extensive experimental results and in-depth analysis
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed frameworks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Low rank matrix recovery problems appear widely in statistics, combinatorics,
and imaging. One celebrated method for solving these problems is to formulate
and solve a semidefinite program (SDP). It is often known that the exact
solution to the SDP with perfect data recovers the solution to the original low
rank matrix recovery problem. It is more challenging to show that an
approximate solution to the SDP formulated with noisy problem data acceptably
solves the original problem; arguments are usually ad hoc for each problem
setting, and can be complex.

In this note, we identify a set of conditions that we call simplicity that
limit the error due to noisy problem data or incomplete convergence. In this
sense, simple SDPs are robust: simple SDPs can be (approximately) solved
efficiently at scale; and the resulting approximate solutions, even with noisy
data, can be trusted. Moreover, we show that simplicity holds generically, and
also for many structured low rank matrix recovery problems, including the
stochastic block model, $\mathbb{Z}_2$ synchronization, and matrix completion.
Formally, we call an SDP simple if it has a surjective constraint map, admits a
unique primal and dual solution pair, and satisfies strong duality and strict
complementarity.

However, simplicity is not a panacea: we show the Burer-Monteiro formulation
of the SDP may have spurious second-order critical points, even for a simple
SDP with a rank 1 solution.]]></summary>

which may include a regularization term, using (possibly noisy) evaluations of
the function. Such optimization is also called derivative-free, zeroth-order,
or black-box optimization. We propose a new $\textbf{Z}$eroth-$\textbf{O}$rder
$\textbf{R}$egularized $\textbf{O}$ptimization method, dubbed ZORO. When the
underlying gradient is approximately sparse at an iterate, ZORO needs very few
objective function evaluations to obtain a new iterate that decreases the
objective function. We achieve this with an adaptive, randomized gradient
estimator, followed by an inexact proximal-gradient scheme. Under a novel
approximately sparse gradient assumption and various different convex settings,
we show the (theoretical and empirical) convergence rate of ZORO is only
logarithmically dependent on the problem dimension. Numerical experiments show
that ZORO outperforms the existing methods with similar assumptions, on both
synthetic and real datasets.]]></summary>

modelling. We assume we are given some language model as a black box. The
objective is to obtain a weighted finite automaton (WFA) that fits within a
given size constraint and which mimics the behaviour of the original model
while minimizing some notion of distance between the black box and the
extracted WFA. We provide an algorithm for the approximate minimization of
black boxes trained for language modelling of sequential data over a one-letter
alphabet. By reformulating the problem in terms of Hankel matrices, we leverage
classical results on the approximation of Hankel operators, namely the
celebrated Adamyan-Arov-Krein (AAK) theory. This allows us to use the spectral
norm to measure the distance between the black box and the WFA. We provide
theoretical guarantees to study the potentially infinite-rank Hankel matrix of
the black box, without accessing the training data, and we prove that our
method returns an asymptotically-optimal approximation.]]></summary>

multiple clinical trials and healthcare procedures. Cardiovascular diseases
monitoring, usually involving electrocardiogram (ECG) traces analysis, is one
of the most promising and high-impact applications. Nevertheless, to fully
exploit the potential of IoMT in this domain, some steps forward are needed.
First, the edge-computing paradigm must be added to the picture. A certain
level of near-sensor processing has to be enabled, to improve the scalability,
portability, reliability, responsiveness of the IoMT nodes. Second, novel,
increasingly accurate, data analysis algorithms, such as those based on
artificial intelligence and Deep Learning, must be exploited. To reach these
objectives, designers and programmers of IoMT nodes, have to face challenging
optimization tasks, in order to execute fairly complex computing tasks on
low-power wearable and portable processing systems, with tight power and
battery lifetime budgets. In this work, we explore the implementation of a
cognitive data analysis algorithm, based on a convolutional neural network
trained to classify ECG waveforms, on a resource-constrained
microcontroller-based computing platform. To minimize power consumption, we add
an adaptivity layer that dynamically manages the hardware and software
configuration of the device to adapt it at runtime to the required operating
mode. Our experimental results show that adapting the node setup to the
workload at runtime can save up to 50% power consumption. Our optimized and
quantized neural network reaches an accuracy value higher than 97% for
arrhythmia disorders detection on MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset.]]></summary>

boosting on separable data, taking statistical and computational perspectives.
We consider a high-dimensional setting where the number of features (weak
learners) $p$ scales with the sample size $n$, in an overparametrized regime.
Under a class of statistical models, we provide an exact analysis of the
generalization error of boosting when the algorithm interpolates the training
data and maximizes the empirical $\ell_1$-margin. Further, we explicitly pin
down the relation between the boosting test error and the optimal Bayes error,
as well as the proportion of active features at interpolation (with zero
initialization). In turn, these precise characterizations answer certain
questions raised in \cite{breiman1999prediction, schapire1998boosting}
surrounding boosting, under assumed data generating processes. At the heart of
our theory lies an in-depth study of the maximum-$\ell_1$-margin, which can be
accurately described by a new system of non-linear equations; to analyze this
margin, we rely on Gaussian comparison techniques and develop a novel uniform
deviation argument. Our statistical and computational arguments can handle (1)
any finite-rank spiked covariance model for the feature distribution and (2)
variants of boosting corresponding to general $\ell_q$-geometry, $q \in [1,
2]$. As a final component, via the Lindeberg principle, we establish a
universality result showcasing that the scaled $\ell_1$-margin (asymptotically)
remains the same, whether the covariates used for boosting arise from a
non-linear random feature model or an appropriately linearized model with
matching moments.]]></summary>

methods with data assimilation to reconstruct a dynamical system using only
sparse and noisy observations of that system. The same approach can be used to
correct the error of a knowledge-based model. The resulting surrogate model is
hybrid, with a statistical part supplementing a physical part. In practice, the
correction can be added as an integrated term (\textit{i.e.} in the model
resolvent) or directly inside the tendencies of the physical model. The
resolvent correction is easy to implement. The tendency correction is more
technical, in particular it requires the adjoint of the physical model, but
also more flexible. We use the two-scale Lorenz model to compare the two
methods. The accuracy in long-range forecast experiments is somewhat similar
between the surrogate models using the resolvent correction and the tendency
correction. By contrast, the surrogate models using the tendency correction
significantly outperform the surrogate models using the resolvent correction in
data assimilation experiments. Finally, we show that the tendency correction
opens the possibility to make online model error correction, \textit{i.e.}
improving the model progressively as new observations become available. The
resulting algorithm can be seen as a new formulation of weak-constraint 4D-Var.
We compare online and offline learning using the same framework with the
two-scale Lorenz system, and show that with online learning, it is possible to
extract all the information from sparse and noisy observations.]]></summary>

role in financing climate mitigation, forest conservation, and reforestation.
Measuring how much carbon is stored in forests is, however, still largely done
via expensive, time-consuming, and sometimes unaccountable field measurements.
To overcome these limitations, many verification bodies are leveraging machine
learning (ML) algorithms to estimate forest carbon from satellite or aerial
imagery. Aerial imagery allows for tree species or family classification, which
improves the satellite imagery-based forest type classification. However,
aerial imagery is significantly more expensive to collect and it is unclear by
how much the higher resolution improves the forest carbon estimation. This
proposal paper describes the first systematic comparison of forest carbon
estimation from aerial imagery, satellite imagery, and ground-truth field
measurements via deep learning-based algorithms for a tropical reforestation
project. Our initial results show that forest carbon estimates from satellite
imagery can overestimate above-ground biomass by more than 10-times for
tropical reforestation projects. The significant difference between aerial and
satellite-derived forest carbon measurements shows the potential for aerial
imagery-based ML algorithms and raises the importance to extend this study to a
global benchmark between options for carbon measurements.]]></summary>

constrained adaptive neural control policies and dynamical models of unknown
linear systems. DPC presents an approximate data-driven solution approach to
the explicit Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem as a scalable alternative
to computationally expensive multiparametric programming solvers. DPC is
formulated as a constrained deep learning problem whose architecture is
inspired by the structure of classical MPC. The optimization of the neural
control policy is based on automatic differentiation of the MPC-inspired loss
function through a differentiable closed-loop system model. This novel solution
approach can optimize adaptive neural control policies for time-varying
references while obeying state and input constraints without the prior need of
an MPC controller. We show that DPC can learn to stabilize constrained neural
control policies for systems with unstable dynamics. Moreover, we provide
sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability of generic closed-loop system
dynamics with neural feedback policies. In simulation case studies, we assess
the performance of the proposed DPC method in terms of reference tracking,
robustness, and computational and memory footprints compared against classical

real-world stock market data since the error in estimation for the expected
returns adversely affects the performance of the portfolio. This paper presents
three approaches to portfolio design, viz, the minimum risk portfolio, the
optimum risk portfolio, and the Eigen portfolio, for seven important sectors of
the Indian stock market. The daily historical prices of the stocks are scraped
from Yahoo Finance website from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020. Three
portfolios are built for each of the seven sectors chosen for this study, and
the portfolios are analyzed on the training data based on several metrics such
as annualized return and risk, weights assigned to the constituent stocks, the
correlation heatmaps, and the principal components of the Eigen portfolios.
Finally, the optimum risk portfolios and the Eigen portfolios for all sectors
are tested on their return over a period of a six-month period. The
performances of the portfolios are compared and the portfolio yielding the
higher return for each sector is identified.]]></summary>

the similarity matrix. To address the issues, I develop a new approximate
spectral clustering using the network generated by growing neural gas (GNG),

for vector quantization but also the topology of the network for extraction of
the topological relationship between data points in a dataset. ASC with GNG
calculates the similarity matrix from both the reference vectors and the
topology of the network generated by GNG. Using the network generated from a

heuristics developed with decades of research to solve large-scale MIP
instances encountered in practice. Machine learning offers to automatically
construct better heuristics from data by exploiting shared structure among
instances in the data. This paper applies learning to the two key sub-tasks of
a MIP solver, generating a high-quality joint variable assignment, and bounding
the gap in objective value between that assignment and an optimal one. Our
approach constructs two corresponding neural network-based components, Neural
Diving and Neural Branching, to use in a base MIP solver such as SCIP. Neural
Diving learns a deep neural network to generate multiple partial assignments
for its integer variables, and the resulting smaller MIPs for un-assigned
variables are solved with SCIP to construct high quality joint assignments.
Neural Branching learns a deep neural network to make variable selection
decisions in branch-and-bound to bound the objective value gap with a small
tree. This is done by imitating a new variant of Full Strong Branching we
propose that scales to large instances using GPUs. We evaluate our approach on
six diverse real-world datasets, including two Google production datasets and
MIPLIB, by training separate neural networks on each. Most instances in all the
datasets combined have $10^3-10^6$ variables and constraints after presolve,
which is significantly larger than previous learning approaches. Comparing
solvers with respect to primal-dual gap averaged over a held-out set of
instances, the learning-augmented SCIP is 2x to 10x better on all datasets
except one on which it is $10^5$x better, at large time limits. To the best of
our knowledge, ours is the first learning approach to demonstrate such large
improvements over SCIP on both large-scale real-world application datasets and

powerful tool, but it requires a high computational cost. Recently, for fast
computation of the Wasserstein distance, methods for approximating the
Wasserstein distance using a tree metric have been proposed. These tree-based
methods allow fast comparisons of a large number of documents; however, they
are unsupervised and do not learn task-specific distances. In this work, we
propose the Supervised Tree-Wasserstein (STW) distance, a fast, supervised
metric learning method based on the tree metric. Specifically, we rewrite the
Wasserstein distance on the tree metric by the parent-child relationships of a
tree and formulate it as a continuous optimization problem using a contrastive
loss. Experimentally, we show that the STW distance can be computed fast, and
improves the accuracy of document classification tasks. Furthermore, the STW
distance is formulated by matrix multiplications, runs on a GPU, and is
suitable for batch processing. Therefore, we show that the STW distance is
extremely efficient when comparing a large number of documents.]]></summary>

still a challenge due to kinematic complexity and environmental uncertainty. In
this paper, we deal with the decentralized flocking and collision avoidance
problem through deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Specifically, we formulate a
decentralized DRL-based decision making framework from the perspective of every
follower, where a collision avoidance mechanism is integrated into the flocking
controller. Then, we propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm PS-CACER
for training a shared control policy for all the followers. Besides, we design
a plug-n-play embedding module based on convolutional neural networks and the
attention mechanism. As a result, the variable-length system state can be
encoded into a fixed-length embedding vector, which makes the learned DRL
policy independent with the number and the order of followers. Finally,
numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, and the learned policies can be directly transferred to semi-physical

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent work has shown that graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to
adversarial attacks on graph data. Common attack approaches are typically
informed, i.e. they have access to information about node attributes such as
labels and feature vectors. In this work, we study adversarial attacks that are
uninformed, where an attacker only has access to the graph structure, but no
information about node attributes. Here the attacker aims to exploit structural
knowledge and assumptions, which GNN models make about graph data. In
particular, literature has shown that structural node centrality and similarity
have a strong influence on learning with GNNs. Therefore, we study the impact
of centrality and similarity on adversarial attacks on GNNs. We demonstrate
that attackers can exploit this information to decrease the performance of GNNs
by focusing on injecting links between nodes of low similarity and,
surprisingly, low centrality. We show that structure-based uninformed attacks
can approach the performance of informed attacks, while being computationally
more efficient. With our paper, we present a new attack strategy on GNNs that
we refer to as Structack. Structack can successfully manipulate the performance
of GNNs with very limited information while operating under tight computational
constraints. Our work contributes towards building more robust machine learning
approaches on graphs.]]></summary>

simplest version is $x_{n+1}=x_n-w_n$ where
$w_n=pr_{A_n,+}(v_n)-pr_{A_n,-}(v_n)$, with $A_n=\nabla
^2f(x_n)+\delta_n||\nabla f(x_n)||^2.Id$ and $v_n=A_n^{-1}.\nabla f(x_n)$. Here
$\delta_n$ is an appropriate real number so that $A_n$ is invertible, and
$pr_{A_n,\pm}$ are projections to the vector subspaces generated by
eigenvectors of positive (correspondingly negative) eigenvalues of $A_n$.

The main result of this paper roughly says that if $f$ is $C^3$ and a
sequence $\{x_n\}$, constructed by the New Q-Newton's method from a random
initial point $x_0$, {\bf converges}, then the limit point is a critical point
and is not a saddle point, and the convergence rate is the same as that of
Newton's method. At the end of the paper, we present some issues (saddle points
and convergence) one faces when implementing Newton's method and modifications
into Deep Neural Networks. We test the good performance of New Q-Newton's
method against algorithms such as Newton's method, BFGS, Adaptive Cubic
Regularization, Random damping Newton's method and Inertial Newton's method, as
well as Unbounded Two-way Backtracking Gradient Descent. The experiments cover
both realistic settings (such as a toy model of protein folding and stochastic

control policy that drives the agent's state towards the targets. Our novel
contribution is that with our exploration data, we are able to learn the

Trained once for each agent or simulation environment, the policy improves the
efficiency of optimizing both trajectories and high-level policies across
multiple tasks and optimization algorithms. We also contribute novel
visualizations that show how using target states as actions makes optimized
trajectories more robust to disturbances; this manifests as wider optima that
are easy to find. Due to its simplicity and generality, our proposed approach

architectures and to train them until they (almost) achieve zero training
error. Empirically observed good generalization performance on test data, even
in the presence of lots of label noise, corroborate such a procedure. On the
other hand, in statistical learning theory it is known that over-fitting models
may lead to poor generalization properties, occurring in e.g. empirical risk
minimization (ERM) over too large hypotheses classes. Inspired by this
contradictory behavior, so-called interpolation methods have recently received
much attention, leading to consistent and optimally learning methods for some
local averaging schemes with zero training error. However, there is no
theoretical analysis of interpolating ERM-like methods so far. We take a step
in this direction by showing that for certain, large hypotheses classes, some
interpolating ERMs enjoy very good statistical guarantees while others fail in
the worst sense. Moreover, we show that the same phenomenon occurs for DNNs

major programming language in the development landscape. While praised for its
clean syntax and C-like performance, Go also contains a strong static
type-system that prevents arbitrary type casting and arbitrary memory access,
making the language type-safe by design. However, to give developers the
possibility of implementing low-level code, Go ships with a special package
called unsafe that offers developers a way around the type-safety of Go
programs. The package gives greater flexibility to developers but comes at a
higher risk of runtime errors, chances of non-portability, and the loss of
compatibility guarantees for future versions of Go.

In this paper, we present the first large-scale study on the usage of the
unsafe package in 2,438 popular Go projects. Our investigation shows that
unsafe is used in 24% of Go projects, motivated primarily by communicating with
operating systems and C code, but is also commonly used as a source of
performance optimization. Developers are willing to use unsafe to break
language specifications (e.g., string immutability) for better performance and
6% of analyzed projects that use unsafe perform risky pointer conversions that
can lead to program crashes and unexpected behavior. Furthermore, we report a
series of real issues faced by projects that use unsafe, from crashing errors
and non-deterministic behavior to having their deployment restricted from
certain popular environments. Our findings can be used to understand how and
why developers break type-safety in Go, and help motivate further tools and
language development that could make the usage of unsafe in Go even safer.]]></summary>

some of model parameters, reducing storage cost and improving prediction
accuracy. The common sharing practice is to share bottom layers of a deep
neural network among tasks while using separate top layers for each task. In
this work, we revisit this common practice via an empirical study on
fine-grained image classification tasks and make two surprising observations.
(1) Using separate bottom-layer parameters could achieve significantly better
performance than the common practice and this phenomenon holds for different
number of tasks jointly trained on different backbone architectures with
different quantity of task-specific parameters. (2) A multi-task model with a
small proportion of task-specific parameters from bottom layers can achieve
competitive performance with independent models trained on each task separately
and outperform a state-of-the-art MTL framework. Our observations suggest that
people rethink the current sharing paradigm and adopt the new strategy of using
separate bottom-layer parameters as a stronger baseline for model design in
MTL.]]></summary>

initialization towards a target task. In this paper, we go further and extract
synthetic data by leveraging the learnt model parameters. We dub them "Data

to privacy or sensitivity concerns). We show the applicability of data

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We consider the vector embedding problem. We are given a finite set of items,
with the goal of assigning a representative vector to each one, possibly under
some constraints (such as the collection of vectors being standardized, i.e.,
have zero mean and unit covariance). We are given data indicating that some
pairs of items are similar, and optionally, some other pairs are dissimilar.
For pairs of similar items, we want the corresponding vectors to be near each
other, and for dissimilar pairs, we want the corresponding vectors to not be
near each other, measured in Euclidean distance. We formalize this by
introducing distortion functions, defined for some pairs of the items. Our goal
is to choose an embedding that minimizes the total distortion, subject to the
constraints. We call this the minimum-distortion embedding (MDE) problem.

The MDE framework is simple but general. It includes a wide variety of
embedding methods, such as spectral embedding, principal component analysis,
multidimensional scaling, dimensionality reduction methods (like Isomap and
UMAP), force-directed layout, and others. It also includes new embeddings, and
provides principled ways of validating historical and new embeddings alike.

We develop a projected quasi-Newton method that approximately solves MDE
problems and scales to large data sets. We implement this method in PyMDE, an
open-source Python package. In PyMDE, users can select from a library of
distortion functions and constraints or specify custom ones, making it easy to
rapidly experiment with different embeddings. Our software scales to data sets
with millions of items and tens of millions of distortion functions. To
demonstrate our method, we compute embeddings for several real-world data sets,
including images, an academic co-author network, US county demographic data,
and single-cell mRNA transcriptomes.]]></summary>

call ACORN, to analyze videos of school classrooms for the Positive Climate
(PC) and Negative Climate (NC) dimensions of the CLASS observation protocol
that is widely used in educational research. ACORN uses convolutional neural
networks to analyze spectral audio features, the faces of teachers and
students, and the pixels of each image frame, and then integrates this
information over time using Temporal Convolutional Networks. The audiovisual
ACORN's PC and NC predictions have Pearson correlations of $0.55$ and $0.63$
with ground-truth scores provided by expert CLASS coders on the UVA Toddler
dataset (cross-validation on $n=300$ 15-min video segments), and a purely
auditory ACORN predicts PC and NC with correlations of $0.36$ and $0.41$ on the
MET dataset (test set of $n=2000$ videos segments). These numbers are similar
to inter-coder reliability of human coders. Finally, using Graph Convolutional
Networks we make early strides (AUC=$0.70$) toward predicting the specific
moments (45-90sec clips) when the PC is particularly weak/strong. Our findings
inform the design of automatic classroom observation and also more general
video activity recognition and summary recognition systems.]]></summary>

a challenge to identify the individuals at risk of dementia for precise
management. Brain MRI offers a noninvasive biomarker to detect brain aging.
Previous evidence shows that the brain structural change detected by diffusion
MRI is associated with dementia. Mounting studies has conceptualised the brain
as a complex network, which has shown the utility of this approach in
characterising various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Therefore, the
structural connectivity shows promise in dementia classification. The proposed
BrainNetGAN is a generative adversarial network variant to augment the brain
structural connectivity matrices for binary dementia classification tasks.
Structural connectivity matrices between separated brain regions are
constructed using tractography on diffusion MRI data. The BrainNetGAN model is
trained to generate fake brain connectivity matrices, which are expected to
reflect latent distribution of the real brain network data. Finally, a
convolutional neural network classifier is proposed for binary dementia
classification. Numerical results show that the binary classification
performance in the testing set was improved using the BrainNetGAN augmented
dataset. The proposed methodology allows quick synthesis of an arbitrary number
of augmented connectivity matrices and can be easily transferred to similar
classification tasks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Robustness of huge Transformer-based models for natural language processing
is an important issue due to their capabilities and wide adoption. One way to
understand and improve robustness of these models is an exploration of an
adversarial attack scenario: check if a small perturbation of an input can fool
a model.

Due to the discrete nature of textual data, gradient-based adversarial
methods, widely used in computer vision, are not applicable per~se. The
standard strategy to overcome this issue is to develop token-level
transformations, which do not take the whole sentence into account.

In this paper, we propose a new black-box sentence-level attack. Our method
fine-tunes a pre-trained language model to generate adversarial examples. A
proposed differentiable loss function depends on a substitute classifier score
and an approximate edit distance computed via a deep learning model.

We show that the proposed attack outperforms competitors on a diverse set of
NLP problems for both computed metrics and human evaluation. Moreover, due to
the usage of the fine-tuned language model, the generated adversarial examples
are hard to detect, thus current models are not robust. Hence, it is difficult
to defend from the proposed attack, which is not the case for other attacks.]]></summary>

time restrictions. There is a large body of work on training dense networks to
yield sparse networks for inference, but this limits the size of the largest
trainable sparse model to that of the largest trainable dense model. In this
paper we introduce a method to train sparse neural networks with a fixed
parameter count and a fixed computational cost throughout training, without
sacrificing accuracy relative to existing dense-to-sparse training methods. Our
method updates the topology of the sparse network during training by using
parameter magnitudes and infrequent gradient calculations. We show that this
approach requires fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) to achieve a given
level of accuracy compared to prior techniques. We demonstrate state-of-the-art
sparse training results on a variety of networks and datasets, including
ResNet-50, MobileNets on Imagenet-2012, and RNNs on WikiText-103. Finally, we
provide some insights into why allowing the topology to change during the
optimization can overcome local minima encountered when the topology remains
static. Code used in our work can be found in github.com/google-research/rigl.]]></summary>

impressive results in the last few years. In this paper, we consider the use of
generative models in a variational regularisation approach to inverse problems.
The considered regularisers penalise images that are far from the range of a
generative model that has learned to produce images similar to a training
dataset. We name this family \textit{generative regularisers}. The success of
generative regularisers depends on the quality of the generative model and so
we propose a set of desired criteria to assess models and guide future
research. In our numerical experiments, we evaluate three common generative
models, autoencoders, variational autoencoders and generative adversarial
networks, against our desired criteria. We also test three different generative
regularisers on the inverse problems of deblurring, deconvolution, and
tomography. We show that the success of solutions restricted to lie exactly in
the range of the generator is highly dependent on the ability of the generative
model but that allowing small deviations from the range of the generator
produces more consistent results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most of existing studies on adaptive submodular optimization focus on the
average-case, i.e., their objective is to find a policy that maximizes the
expected utility over a known distribution of realizations. However, a policy
that has a good average-case performance may have very poor performance under
the worst-case realization. In this study, we propose to study two variants of
adaptive submodular optimization problems, namely, worst-case adaptive
submodular maximization and robust submodular maximization. The first problem
aims to find a policy that maximizes the worst-case utility and the latter one
aims to find a policy, if any, that achieves both near optimal average-case
utility and worst-case utility simultaneously. We introduce a new class of
stochastic functions, called \emph{worst-case submodular function}. For the
worst-case adaptive submodular maximization problem subject to a $p$-system
constraint, we develop an adaptive worst-case greedy policy that achieves a
$\frac{1}{p+1}$ approximation ratio against the optimal worst-case utility if
the utility function is worst-case submodular. For the robust adaptive
submodular maximization problem subject to a cardinality constraint, if the
utility function is both worst-case submodular and adaptive submodular, we
develop a hybrid adaptive policy that achieves an approximation close to
$1-e^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ under both worst case setting and average case setting
simultaneously. We also describe several applications of our theoretical
results, including pool-base active learning, stochastic submodular set cover
and adaptive viral marketing.]]></summary>

motivated by the need to quantify uncertainty in predictions or to model a
diverse population without being overly reductive. As such, many models have

general framework (inspired by neural network optimization) for aggregating any
number of conditional quantile models in order to boost predictive accuracy. We
consider weighted ensembling strategies of increasing flexibility where the
weights may vary over individual models, quantile levels, and feature values.
An appeal of our approach is its portability: we ensure that estimated
quantiles at adjacent levels do not cross by applying simple transformations
through which gradients can be backpropagated, and this allows us to leverage
the modern deep learning toolkit for building quantile ensembles. Our
experiments confirm that ensembling can lead to big gains in accuracy, even
when the constituent models are themselves powerful and flexible.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Machine learning models always make a prediction, even when it is likely to
be inaccurate. This behavior should be avoided in many decision support
applications, where mistakes can have severe consequences. Albeit already
studied in 1970, machine learning with a reject option recently gained
interest. This machine learning subfield enables machine learning models to
abstain from making a prediction when likely to make a mistake.

This survey aims to provide an overview on machine learning with a reject
option. We introduce the conditions leading to two types of rejection,
ambiguity and novelty rejection. Moreover, we define the existing architectures
for models with a reject option, describe the standard learning strategies to
train such models and relate traditional machine learning techniques to
rejection. Additionally, we review strategies to evaluate a model's predictive
and rejective quality. Finally, we provide examples of relevant application
domains and show how machine learning with rejection relates to other machine
learning research areas.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper studies distributed algorithms for (strongly convex) composite
optimization problems over mesh networks, subject to quantized communications.
Instead of focusing on a specific algorithmic design, we propose a black-box
model casting distributed algorithms in the form of fixed-point iterates,
converging at linear rate. The algorithmic model is coupled with a novel
(random) Biased Compression (BC-)rule on the quantizer design, which preserves
linear convergence. A new quantizer coupled with a communication-efficient
encoding scheme is also proposed, which efficiently implements the BC-rule
using a finite number of bits. This contrasts with most of existing
quantization rules, whose implementation calls for an infinite number of bits.
A unified communication complexity analysis is developed for the black-box
model, determining the average number of bit required to reach a solution of
the optimization problem within the required accuracy. Numerical results
validate our theoretical findings and show that distributed algorithms equipped
with the proposed quantizer have more favorable communication complexity than
algorithms using existing quantization rules.]]></summary>

processing applications. Wavelet design has been an active field of research
for over two decades, with the problem often being approached from an
analytical perspective. In this paper, we introduce a learning based approach
to wavelet design. We draw a parallel between convolutional autoencoders and
wavelet multiresolution approximation, and show how the learning angle provides
a coherent computational framework for addressing the design problem. We aim at
designing data-independent wavelets by training filterbank autoencoders, which
precludes the need for customized datasets. In fact, we use high-dimensional
Gaussian vectors for training filterbank autoencoders, and show that a
near-zero training loss implies that the learnt filters satisfy the perfect
reconstruction property with very high probability. Properties of a wavelet
such as orthogonality, compact support, smoothness, symmetry, and vanishing
moments can be incorporated by designing the autoencoder architecture
appropriately and with a suitable regularization term added to the mean-squared
error cost used in the learning process. Our approach not only recovers the
well known Daubechies family of orthogonal wavelets and the
Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau family of symmetric biorthogonal wavelets, but also
learns wavelets outside these families.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many machine learning applications, e.g., privacy-preserving learning,
algorithmic fairness and domain adaptation/generalization, involve learning the
so-called invariant representations that achieve two competing goals: To
maximize information or accuracy with respect to a target while simultaneously
maximizing invariance or independence with respect to a set of protected
features (e.g.\ for fairness, privacy, etc). Despite its abundant applications
in the aforementioned domains, theoretical understanding on the limits and
tradeoffs of invariant representations is still severely lacking. In this
paper, we provide an information theoretic analysis of this general and
important problem under both classification and regression settings. In both
cases, we analyze the inherent tradeoffs between accuracy and invariance by
providing a geometric characterization of the feasible region in the
information plane, where we connect the geometric properties of this feasible
region to the fundamental limitations of the tradeoff problem. In the
regression setting, we further give a complete and exact characterization of
the frontier between accuracy and invariance. Although our contributions are
mainly theoretical, we also demonstrate the practical applications of our
results in certifying the suboptimality of certain representation learning
algorithms in both classification and regression tasks. Our results shed new
light on this fundamental problem by providing insights on the interplay
between accuracy and invariance. These results deepen our understanding of this
fundamental problem and may be useful in guiding the design of future
representation learning algorithms.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We propose a novel method for solving regression tasks using few-shot or weak
supervision. At the core of our method is the fundamental observation that GANs
are incredibly successful at encoding semantic information within their latent
space, even in a completely unsupervised setting. For modern generative
frameworks, this semantic encoding manifests as smooth, linear directions which
affect image attributes in a disentangled manner. These directions have been
widely used in GAN-based image editing. We show that such directions are not
only linear, but that the magnitude of change induced on the respective
attribute is approximately linear with respect to the distance traveled along
them. By leveraging this observation, our method turns a pre-trained GAN into a
regression model, using as few as two labeled samples. This enables solving
regression tasks on datasets and attributes which are difficult to produce
quality supervision for. Additionally, we show that the same latent-distances
can be used to sort collections of images by the strength of given attributes,
even in the absence of explicit supervision. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our method can be applied across a wide range of domains,
leverage multiple latent direction discovery frameworks, and achieve
state-of-the-art results in few-shot and low-supervision settings, even when
compared to methods designed to tackle a single task.]]></summary>

feature importance in explainable AI: it has clear axiomatic foundations, is

which directly extend the Shapley axioms. This preserves the classic Shapley
value's intuitions: joint Shapley values measure a set of features' average
effect on a model's prediction. We prove the uniqueness of joint Shapley
values, for any order of explanation. Results for games show that joint Shapley
values present different insights from existing interaction indices, which
assess the effect of a feature within a set of features. Deriving joint Shapley
values in ML attribution problems thus gives us the first measure of the joint

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Viewing neural network models in terms of their loss landscapes has a long
history in the statistical mechanics approach to learning, and in recent years
it has received attention within machine learning proper. Among other things,
local metrics (such as the smoothness of the loss landscape) have been shown to
correlate with global properties of the model (such as good generalization).
Here, we perform a detailed empirical analysis of the loss landscape structure
of thousands of neural network models, systematically varying learning tasks,
model architectures, and/or quantity/quality of data. By considering a range of
metrics that attempt to capture different aspects of the loss landscape, we
demonstrate that the best test accuracy is obtained when: the loss landscape is
globally well-connected; ensembles of trained models are more similar to each
other; and models converge to locally smooth regions. We also show that
globally poorly-connected landscapes can arise when models are small or when
they are trained to lower quality data; and that, if the loss landscape is
globally poorly-connected, then training to zero loss can actually lead to
worse test accuracy. Based on these results, we develop a simple
one-dimensional model with load-like and temperature-like parameters, we
introduce the notion of an \emph{effective loss landscape} depending on these
parameters, and we interpret our results in terms of a \emph{rugged convexity}
of the loss landscape. When viewed through this lens, our detailed empirical
results shed light on phases of learning (and consequent double descent
behavior), fundamental versus incidental determinants of good generalization,
the role of load-like and temperature-like parameters in the learning process,
different influences on the loss landscape from model and data, and the
relationships between local and global metrics, all topics of recent interest.]]></summary>

modelling the output distribution through likelihood heatmaps. In contrast,
regression-based methods are more efficient but suffer from inferior
performance. In this work, we explore maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to
develop an efficient and effective regression-based methods. From the
perspective of MLE, adopting different regression losses is making different
assumptions about the output density function. A density function closer to the
true distribution leads to a better regression performance. In light of this,
we propose a novel regression paradigm with Residual Log-likelihood Estimation
(RLE) to capture the underlying output distribution. Concretely, RLE learns the
change of the distribution instead of the unreferenced underlying distribution
to facilitate the training process. With the proposed reparameterization
design, our method is compatible with off-the-shelf flow models. The proposed
method is effective, efficient and flexible. We show its potential in various
human pose estimation tasks with comprehensive experiments. Compared to the
conventional regression paradigm, regression with RLE bring 12.4 mAP
improvement on MSCOCO without any test-time overhead. Moreover, for the first
time, especially on multi-person pose estimation, our regression method is
superior to the heatmap-based methods. Our code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning algorithms are growing in popularity in the field of
exoplanetary science due to their ability to model highly non-linear relations
and solve interesting problems in a data-driven manner. Several works have
attempted to perform fast retrievals of atmospheric parameters with the use of
machine learning algorithms like deep neural networks (DNNs). Yet, despite
their high predictive power, DNNs are also infamous for being 'black boxes'. It
is their apparent lack of explainability that makes the astrophysics community
reluctant to adopt them. What are their predictions based on? How confident
should we be in them? When are they wrong and how wrong can they be? In this
work, we present a number of general evaluation methodologies that can be
applied to any trained model and answer questions like these. In particular, we
train three different popular DNN architectures to retrieve atmospheric
parameters from exoplanet spectra and show that all three achieve good
predictive performance. We then present an extensive analysis of the
predictions of DNNs, which can inform us - among other things - of the
credibility limits for atmospheric parameters for a given instrument and model.
Finally, we perform a perturbation-based sensitivity analysis to identify to
which features of the spectrum the outcome of the retrieval is most sensitive.
We conclude that for different molecules, the wavelength ranges to which the
DNN's predictions are most sensitive, indeed coincide with their characteristic
absorption regions. The methodologies presented in this work help to improve
the evaluation of DNNs and to grant interpretability to their predictions.]]></summary>

methods with data assimilation to reconstruct a dynamical system using only
sparse and noisy observations of that system. The same approach can be used to
correct the error of a knowledge-based model. The resulting surrogate model is
hybrid, with a statistical part supplementing a physical part. In practice, the
correction can be added as an integrated term (i.e. in the model resolvent) or
directly inside the tendencies of the physical model. The resolvent correction
is easy to implement. The tendency correction is more technical, in particular
it requires the adjoint of the physical model, but also more flexible. We use
the two-scale Lorenz model to compare the two methods. The accuracy in
long-range forecast experiments is somewhat similar between the surrogate
models using the resolvent correction and the tendency correction. By contrast,
the surrogate models using the tendency correction significantly outperform the
surrogate models using the resolvent correction in data assimilation
experiments. Finally, we show that the tendency correction opens the
possibility to make online model error correction, i.e. improving the model
progressively as new observations become available. The resulting algorithm can
be seen as a new formulation of weak-constraint 4D-Var. We compare online and
offline learning using the same framework with the two-scale Lorenz system, and
show that with online learning, it is possible to extract all the information
from sparse and noisy observations.]]></summary>

and storage requirements of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Efforts toward
creating ultra-low-precision (sub-8-bit) DNNs suggest that the minimum
precision required to achieve a given network-level accuracy varies
considerably across networks, and even across layers within a network,
requiring support for variable precision in DNN hardware. Previous proposals
such as bit-serial hardware incur high overheads, significantly diminishing the
benefits of lower precision. To efficiently support precision
re-configurability in DNN accelerators, we introduce an approximate computing
method wherein DNN computations are performed block-wise (a block is a group of
bits) and re-configurability is supported at the granularity of blocks. Results
of block-wise computations are composed in an approximate manner to enable
efficient re-configurability. We design a DNN accelerator that embodies
approximate blocked computation and propose a method to determine a suitable
approximation configuration for a given DNN. By varying the approximation
configurations across DNNs, we achieve 1.17x-1.73x and 1.02x-2.04x improvement
in system energy and performance respectively, over an 8-bit fixed-point (FxP8)
baseline, with negligible loss in classification accuracy. Further, by varying
the approximation configurations across layers and data-structures within DNNs,
we achieve 1.25x-2.42x and 1.07x-2.95x improvement in system energy and

improvements in performance in recent years. However, they still fail to
provide the same predictive power as CNNs with a large number of parameters.
The diverse and even abundant features captured by the layers is an important
characteristic of these successful CNNs. However, differences in this
characteristic between large CNNs and their compact counterparts have rarely
been investigated. In compact CNNs, due to the limited number of parameters,
abundant features are unlikely to be obtained, and feature diversity becomes an
essential characteristic. Diverse features present in the activation maps
derived from a data point during model inference may indicate the presence of a
set of unique descriptors necessary to distinguish between objects of different
classes. In contrast, data points with low feature diversity may not provide a
sufficient amount of unique descriptors to make a valid prediction; we refer to
them as random predictions. Random predictions can negatively impact the
optimization process and harm the final performance. This paper proposes
addressing the problem raised by random predictions by reshaping the standard
cross-entropy to make it biased toward data points with a limited number of
unique descriptive features. Our novel Bias Loss focuses the training on a set
of valuable data points and prevents the vast number of samples with poor
learning features from misleading the optimization process. Furthermore, to
show the importance of diversity, we present a family of SkipNet models whose
architectures are brought to boost the number of unique descriptors in the last
layers. Our Skipnet-M can achieve 1% higher classification accuracy than

increasing problem, as seen in the rise of detected mobile malware samples per
year. The number of active smartphone users is expected to grow, stressing the
importance of research on the detection of mobile malware. Detection methods
for mobile malware exist but are still limited.

In this paper, we provide an overview of the performance of machine learning
(ML) techniques to detect malware on Android, without using privileged access.
The ML-classifiers use device information such as the CPU usage, battery usage,
and memory usage for the detection of 10 subtypes of Mobile Trojans on the
Android Operating System (OS).

We use a real-life dataset containing device and malware data from 47 users
for a year (2016). We examine which features, i.e. aspects, of a device, are
most important to monitor to detect (subtypes of) Mobile Trojans. The focus of
this paper is on dynamic hardware features. Using these dynamic features we
apply state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers: Random Forest, K-Nearest
Neighbour, and AdaBoost. We show classification results on different feature
sets, making a distinction between global device features, and specific app
features. None of the measured feature sets require privileged access.

Our results show that the Random Forest classifier performs best as a general
malware classifier: across 10 subtypes of Mobile Trojans, it achieves an F1
score of 0.73 with a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.009 and a False Negative
Rate (FNR) of 0.380. The Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours, and AdaBoost
classifiers achieve F1 scores above 0.72, an FPR below 0.02 and, an FNR below
0.33, when trained separately to detect each subtype of Mobile Trojans.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to learn treatment policies and aid
decision making in healthcare. However, given the need for generalization over
complex state/action spaces, the incorporation of function approximators (e.g.,
deep neural networks) requires model selection to reduce overfitting and
improve policy performance at deployment. Yet a standard validation pipeline
for model selection requires running a learned policy in the actual
environment, which is often infeasible in a healthcare setting. In this work,
we investigate a model selection pipeline for offline RL that relies on
off-policy evaluation (OPE) as a proxy for validation performance. We present
an in-depth analysis of popular OPE methods, highlighting the additional
hyperparameters and computational requirements (fitting/inference of auxiliary
models) when used to rank a set of candidate policies. We compare the utility
of different OPE methods as part of the model selection pipeline in the context
of learning to treat patients with sepsis. Among all the OPE methods we
considered, fitted Q evaluation (FQE) consistently leads to the best validation
ranking, but at a high computational cost. To balance this trade-off between
accuracy of ranking and computational efficiency, we propose a simple two-stage
approach to accelerate model selection by avoiding potentially unnecessary
computation. Our work serves as a practical guide for offline RL model
selection and can help RL practitioners select policies using real-world
datasets. To facilitate reproducibility and future extensions, the code

the past few years. Their impact has been seen mainly in the computer vision
field with realistic image and video manipulation, especially generation,
making significant advancements. While these computer vision advances have
garnered much attention, GAN applications have diversified across disciplines
such as time series and sequence generation. As a relatively new niche for
GANs, fieldwork is ongoing to develop high quality, diverse and private time
series data. In this paper, we review GAN variants designed for time series
related applications. We propose a taxonomy of discrete-variant GANs and
continuous-variant GANs, in which GANs deal with discrete time series and
continuous time series data. Here we showcase the latest and most popular
literature in this field; their architectures, results, and applications. We
also provide a list of the most popular evaluation metrics and their
suitability across applications. Also presented is a discussion of privacy
measures for these GANs and further protections and directions for dealing with
sensitive data. We aim to frame clearly and concisely the latest and
state-of-the-art research in this area and their applications to real-world

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been widely used to solve
various scientific computing problems. However, large training costs limit
PINNs for some real-time applications. Although some works have been proposed
to improve the training efficiency of PINNs, few consider the influence of
initialization. To this end, we propose a New Reptile initialization based
Physics-Informed Neural Network (NRPINN). The original Reptile algorithm is a
meta-learning initialization method based on labeled data. PINNs can be trained
with less labeled data or even without any labeled data by adding partial
differential equations (PDEs) as a penalty term into the loss function.
Inspired by this idea, we propose the new Reptile initialization to sample more
tasks from the parameterized PDEs and adapt the penalty term of the loss. The
new Reptile initialization can acquire initialization parameters from related
tasks by supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning. Then, PINNs
with initialization parameters can efficiently solve PDEs. Besides, the new
Reptile initialization can also be used for the variants of PINNs. Finally, we
demonstrate and verify the NRPINN considering both forward problems, including
solving Poisson, Burgers, and Schr\"odinger equations, as well as inverse
problems, where unknown parameters in the PDEs are estimated. Experimental
results show that the NRPINN training is much faster and achieves higher
accuracy than PINNs with other initialization methods.]]></summary>

hardware technology, implementing shallow neural networks on the so-called
Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices has attracted a lot of
interest. Many quantum (convolutional) circuit ansaetze are proposed for
grayscale images classification tasks with promising empirical results.
However, when applying these ansaetze on RGB images, the intra-channel
information that is useful for vision tasks is not extracted effectively. In
this paper, we propose two types of quantum circuit ansaetze to simulate
convolution operations on RGB images, which differ in the way how inter-channel
and intra-channel information are extracted. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work of a quantum convolutional circuit to deal with RGB images
effectively, with a higher test accuracy compared to the purely classical CNNs.
We also investigate the relationship between the size of quantum circuit ansatz
and the learnability of the hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural
network. Through experiments based on CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets, we
demonstrate that a larger size of the quantum circuit ansatz improves
predictive performance in multiclass classification tasks, providing useful
insights for near term quantum algorithm developments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We consider unsupervised cell nuclei segmentation in this paper. Exploiting
the recently-proposed unpaired image-to-image translation between cell nuclei
images and randomly synthetic masks, existing approaches, e.g., CycleGAN, have
achieved encouraging results. However, these methods usually take a two-stage
pipeline and fail to learn end-to-end in cell nuclei images. More seriously,
they could lead to the lossy transformation problem, i.e., the content
inconsistency between the original images and the corresponding segmentation
output. To address these limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end
unsupervised framework called Aligned Disentangling Generative Adversarial
Network (AD-GAN). Distinctively, AD-GAN introduces representation
disentanglement to separate content representation (the underling spatial
structure) from style representation (the rendering of the structure). With
this framework, spatial structure can be preserved explicitly, enabling a
significant reduction of macro-level lossy transformation. We also propose a
novel training algorithm able to align the disentangled content in the latent
space to reduce micro-level lossy transformation. Evaluations on real-world 2D
and 3D datasets show that AD-GAN substantially outperforms the other comparison
methods and the professional software both quantitatively and qualitatively.
Specifically, the proposed AD-GAN leads to significant improvement over the
current best unsupervised methods by an average 17.8% relatively (w.r.t. the
metric DICE) on four cell nuclei datasets. As an unsupervised method, AD-GAN
even performs competitive with the best supervised models, taking a further
leap towards end-to-end unsupervised nuclei segmentation.]]></summary>

infers a continuous probability density function (PDF) from discrete samples.
Thus, it is used in tasks as diverse as analyzing population data, spatial
locations in 2D sensor readings, or reconstructing scenes from 3D scans. In
this paper, we introduce a learned, data-driven deep density estimation (DDE)
to infer PDFs in an accurate and efficient manner, while being independent of
domain dimensionality or sample size. Furthermore, we do not require access to
the original PDF during estimation, neither in parametric form, nor as priors,
or in the form of many samples. This is enabled by training an unstructured
convolutional neural network on an infinite stream of synthetic PDFs, as
unbound amounts of synthetic training data generalize better across a deck of
natural PDFs than any natural finite training data will do. Thus, we hope that
our publicly available DDE method will be beneficial in many areas of data
analysis, where continuous models are to be estimated from discrete
observations.]]></summary>

In particular, we utilize two auxiliary classification layers that learn

Intuitively, the discrepancies in the auxiliary classification layers'

propose a novel method to leverage the classifier discrepancies for the

Sun, which is referred to as solar irradiance, or total solar irradiance (TSI)
when all of the radiation is measured. A minor change in the solar irradiance

result, studying and measuring solar irradiance is crucial in understanding
climate changes and solar variability. Several methods have been developed to
reconstruct total solar irradiance for long and short periods of time; however,
they are physics-based and rely on the availability of data, which does not go

of time that span beyond the physical models' data availability. On the data

accuracy in a variety of tasks, but deep neural networks (DNNs) are shown to
produce highly overconfident scores for even abnormal samples. Well-defined
uncertainty indicates whether a model's output should (or should not) be
trusted and thus becomes critical in real-world scenarios which typically
involves shifted input distributions due to many factors. Existing uncertainty
approaches assume that testing samples from a different data distribution would
induce unreliable model predictions thus have higher uncertainty scores. They
quantify model uncertainty by calibrating DL model's confidence of a given
input and evaluate the effectiveness in computer vision (CV) and natural
language processing (NLP)-related tasks. However, their methodologies'
reliability may be compromised under programming tasks due to difference in
data representations and shift patterns. In this paper, we first define three
different types of distribution shift in program data and build a large-scale
shifted Java dataset. We implement two common programming language tasks on our
dataset to study the effect of each distribution shift on DL model performance.
We also propose a large-scale benchmark of existing state-of-the-art predictive
uncertainty on programming tasks and investigate their effectiveness under data
distribution shift. Experiments show that program distribution shift does
degrade the DL model performance to varying degrees and that existing
uncertainty methods all present certain limitations in quantifying uncertainty

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As one of the most fundamental problems in machine learning, statistics and
differential privacy, Differentially Private Stochastic Convex Optimization
(DP-SCO) has been extensively studied in recent years. However, most of the
previous work can only handle either regular data distribution or irregular
data in the low dimensional space case. To better understand the challenges
arising from irregular data distribution, in this paper we provide the first
study on the problem of DP-SCO with heavy-tailed data in the high dimensional
space. In the first part we focus on the problem over some polytope constraint
(such as the $\ell_1$-norm ball). We show that if the loss function is smooth
and its gradient has bounded second order moment, it is possible to get a (high
probability) error bound (excess population risk) of $\tilde{O}(\frac{\log
d}{(n\epsilon)^\frac{1}{3}})$ in the $\epsilon$-DP model, where $n$ is the
sample size and $d$ is the dimensionality of the underlying space. Next, for
LASSO, if the data distribution that has bounded fourth-order moments, we
improve the bound to $\tilde{O}(\frac{\log d}{(n\epsilon)^\frac{2}{5}})$ in the
$(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP model. In the second part of the paper, we study sparse
learning with heavy-tailed data. We first revisit the sparse linear model and
propose a truncated DP-IHT method whose output could achieve an error of
$\tilde{O}(\frac{s^{*2}\log d}{n\epsilon})$, where $s^*$ is the sparsity of the
underlying parameter. Then we study a more general problem over the sparsity
({\em i.e.,} $\ell_0$-norm) constraint, and show that it is possible to achieve
an error of $\tilde{O}(\frac{s^{*\frac{3}{2}}\log d}{n\epsilon})$, which is
also near optimal up to a factor of $\tilde{O}{(\sqrt{s^*})}$, if the loss
function is smooth and strongly convex.]]></summary>

notorious for 1) instability 2) under-determinism. This two-pronged problem is
tackled with a two-pronged solution that uses double compression to maximally
utilizing the cheap unlabelled data to a) provide a priori information required
to ease under-determinism and b) reduce sensitivity of inference to the input.
The result is a stable solver with a high resolution output. DeepHead is a
fully data-driven implementation of the paradigm proposed in the context of
microwave brain imaging. It infers the dielectric distribution of the brain at
a desired single frequency while making use of an input that spreads over a
wide band of frequencies. The performance of the model is evaluated with both
simulations and human volunteers experiments. The inference made is juxtaposed
with ground-truth dielectric distribution in simulation case, and the golden

the waiting list has being a major challenge in organ transplantation. Because
of the shortage, organ matching decision is the most critical decision to
assign the limited viable organs to the most suitable patients. Currently,
organ matching decisions were only made by matching scores calculated via
scoring models, which are built by the first principles. However, these models
may disagree with the actual post-transplantation matching performance (e.g.,
patient's post-transplant quality of life (QoL) or graft failure measurements).
In this paper, we formulate the organ matching decision-making as a top-N
recommendation problem and propose an Adaptively Weighted Top-N Recommendation
(AWTR) method. AWTR improves performance of the current scoring models by using
limited actual matching performance in historical data set as well as the
collected covariates from organ donors and patients. AWTR sacrifices the
overall recommendation accuracy by emphasizing the recommendation and ranking
accuracy for top-N matched patients. The proposed method is validated in a
simulation study, where KAS [60] is used to simulate the organ-patient
recommendation response. The results show that our proposed method outperforms
seven state-of-the-art top-N recommendation benchmark methods.]]></summary>

test distributions and handle distributional shift. We set up unsupervised
domain adaptation challenges for image classifiers and will evaluate adaptation
to novel viewpoints, backgrounds, modalities and degradation in quality. Our
challenge draws on large-scale publicly available datasets but constructs the
evaluation across domains, rather that the traditional in-domain bench-marking.
Furthermore, we focus on the difficult "universal" setting where, in addition
to input distribution drift, methods may encounter missing and/or novel classes
in the target dataset. Performance will be measured using a rigorous protocol,
comparing to state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods with the help of
established metrics. We believe that the competition will encourage further

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI-based methods have been widely applied to tourism demand forecasting.
However, current AI-based methods are short of the ability to process long-term
dependency, and most of them lack interpretability. The Transformer used
initially for machine translation shows an incredible ability to long-term
dependency processing. Based on the Transformer, we proposed a time series
Transformer (Tsformer) with Encoder-Decoder architecture for tourism demand
forecasting. The proposed Tsformer encodes long-term dependency with encoder,
captures short-term dependency with decoder, and simplifies the attention
interactions under the premise of highlighting dominant attention through a
series of attention masking mechanisms. These improvements make the multi-head
attention mechanism process the input sequence according to the time
relationship, contributing to better interpretability. What's more, the context
processing ability of the Encoder-Decoder architecture allows adopting the
calendar of days to be forecasted to enhance the forecasting performance.
Experiments conducted on the Jiuzhaigou valley and Siguniang mountain tourism
demand datasets with other nine baseline methods indicate that the proposed
Tsformer outperformed all baseline models in the short-term and long-term
tourism demand forecasting tasks. Moreover, ablation studies demonstrate that
the adoption of the calendar of days to be forecasted contributes to the
forecasting performance of the proposed Tsformer. For better interpretability,
the attention weight matrix visualization is performed. It indicates that the
Tsformer concentrates on seasonal features and days close to days to be
forecast in short-term forecasting.]]></summary>

layer. This approach leads to a nonlocal, anisotropic synthetic turbulence
model which we refer to as the deep rapid distortion (DRD) model. Our approach
relies on an operator regression problem which characterizes the best fitting
candidate in a general family of nonlocal covariance kernels parameterized in
part by a neural network. This family of covariance kernels is expressed in
Fourier space and is obtained from approximate solutions to the Navier--Stokes
equations at very high Reynolds numbers. Each member of the family incorporates
important physical properties such as mass conservation and a realistic energy
cascade. The DRD model can be calibrated with noisy data from field
experiments. After calibration, the model can be used to generate synthetic
turbulent velocity fields. To this end, we provide a new numerical method based
on domain decomposition which delivers scalable, memory-efficient turbulence
generation with the DRD model as well as others. We demonstrate the robustness
of our approach with both filtered and noisy data coming from the 1968 Air
Force Cambridge Research Laboratory Kansas experiments. Using this data, we
witness exceptional accuracy with the DRD model, especially when compared to
the International Electrotechnical Commission standard.]]></summary>

learn cross-domain meta-knowledge, which can generalize well on unseen domains.
We conduct extensive experiments under the domain generalization setting.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed shift layer is applicable to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Conditional computation and modular networks have been recently proposed for
multitask learning and other problems as a way to decompose problem solving
into multiple reusable computational blocks. We propose a new approach for
learning modular networks based on the isometric version of ResNet with all
residual blocks having the same configuration and the same number of
parameters. This architectural choice allows adding, removing and changing the
order of residual blocks. In our method, the modules can be invoked repeatedly
and allow knowledge transfer to novel tasks by adjusting the order of
computation. This allows soft weight sharing between tasks with only a small
increase in the number of parameters. We show that our method leads to
interpretable self-organization of modules in case of multi-task learning,
transfer learning and domain adaptation while achieving competitive results on
those tasks. From practical perspective, our approach allows to: (a) reuse
existing modules for learning new task by adjusting the computation order, (b)
use it for unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation to illustrate that
adaptation to unseen data can be achieved by only manipulating the order of
pretrained modules, (c) show how our approach can be used to increase accuracy
of existing architectures for image classification tasks such as ImageNet,
without any parameter increase, by reusing the same block multiple times.]]></summary>

performing an automatic scoring of the sleeping stages. Although any
polysomnography usually collects over a dozen of different signals, this
particular problem has been mainly tackled by using only the
Electroencephalograms presented in those records. On the other hand, the other
recorded signals have been mainly ignored by most works. This paper explores
and compares the convenience of using additional signals apart from
electroencephalograms. More specifically, this work uses the SHHS-1 dataset
with 5,804 patients containing an electromyogram recorded simultaneously as two
electroencephalograms. To compare the results, first, the same architecture has
been evaluated with different input signals and all their possible
combinations. These tests show how, using more than one signal especially if
they are from different sources, improves the results of the classification.
Additionally, the best models obtained for each combination of one or more
signals have been used in ensemble models and, its performance has been
compared showing the convenience of using these multi-signal models to improve
the classification. The best overall model, an ensemble of Depth-wise
Separational Convolutional Neural Networks, has achieved an accuracy of 86.06\%
with a Cohen's Kappa of 0.80 and a $F_{1}$ of 0.77. Up to date, those are the
best results on the complete dataset and it shows a significant improvement in
the precision and recall for the most uncommon class in the dataset.]]></summary>

individuals to mate and produce new generations of species. Allocation of
resources is a key factor in GS. At each selection cycle, breeders are facing
the choice of budget allocation to make crosses and produce the next generation
of breeding parents. Inspired by recent advances in reinforcement learning for
AI problems, we develop a reinforcement learning-based algorithm to
automatically learn to allocate limited resources across different generations
of breeding. We mathematically formulate the problem in the framework of Markov
Decision Process (MDP) by defining state and action spaces. To avoid the
explosion of the state space, an integer linear program is proposed that
quantifies the trade-off between resources and time. Finally, we propose a
value function approximation method to estimate the action-value function and
then develop a greedy policy improvement technique to find the optimal

(MDPs) that is simple to implement and boasts strong theoretical convergence
guarantees. However, the computational cost of value iteration quickly becomes
infeasible as the size of the state space increases. Various methods have been
proposed to overcome this issue for value iteration in large state and action
space MDPs, often at the price, however, of generalizability and algorithmic
simplicity. In this paper, we propose an intuitive algorithm for solving MDPs
that reduces the cost of value iteration updates by dynamically grouping
together states with similar cost-to-go values. We also prove that our
algorithm converges almost surely to within \(2\varepsilon / (1 - \gamma)\) of
the true optimal value in the \(\ell^\infty\) norm, where \(\gamma\) is the
discount factor and aggregated states differ by at most \(\varepsilon\).
Numerical experiments on a variety of simulated environments confirm the
robustness of our algorithm and its ability to solve MDPs with much cheaper
updates especially as the scale of the MDP problem increases.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past few decades, machine learning has revolutionized data processing
for large scale applications. Simultaneously, increasing privacy threats in
trending applications led to the redesign of classical data training models. In
particular, classical machine learning involves centralized data training,
where the data is gathered, and the entire training process executes at the
central server. Despite significant convergence, this training involves several
privacy threats on participants' data when shared with the central cloud
server. To this end, federated learning has achieved significant importance
over distributed data training. In particular, the federated learning allows
participants to collaboratively train the local models on local data without
revealing their sensitive information to the central cloud server. In this
paper, we perform a convergence comparison between classical machine learning
and federated learning on two publicly available datasets, namely,
logistic-regression-MNIST dataset and image-classification-CIFAR-10 dataset.
The simulation results demonstrate that federated learning achieves higher
convergence within limited communication rounds while maintaining participants'
anonymity. We hope that this research will show the benefits and help federated
learning to be implemented widely.]]></summary>

several labeled source domains and transfer knowledge to a target domain that

widely used domain invariant feature learning (IFL) methods relies on aligning
the marginal concept shift w.r.t. $p(x)$, which rests on an unrealistic
assumption that $p(y)$ is invariant across domains. We thereby propose a novel
variational Bayesian inference framework to enforce the conditional
distribution alignment w.r.t. $p(x|y)$ via the prior distribution matching in a
latent space, which also takes the marginal label shift w.r.t. $p(y)$ into
consideration with the posterior alignment. Extensive experiments on various
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework is robust to the label shift and the
cross-domain accuracy is significantly improved, thereby achieving superior

adversarial examples, which aim to mislead DNNs by adding perturbations with
small magnitude. To defend against such attacks, both empirical and theoretical
defense approaches have been extensively studied for a single ML model. In this
work, we aim to analyze and provide the certified robustness for ensemble ML
models, together with the sufficient and necessary conditions of robustness for
different ensemble protocols. Although ensemble models are shown more robust
than a single model empirically; surprisingly, we find that in terms of the
certified robustness the standard ensemble models only achieve marginal
improvement compared to a single model. Thus, to explore the conditions that
guarantee to provide certifiably robust ensemble ML models, we first prove that
diversified gradient and large confidence margin are sufficient and necessary
conditions for certifiably robust ensemble models under the model-smoothness
assumption. We then provide the bounded model-smoothness analysis based on the
proposed Ensemble-before-Smoothing strategy. We also prove that an ensemble
model can always achieve higher certified robustness than a single base model
under mild conditions. Inspired by the theoretical findings, we propose the
lightweight Diversity Regularized Training (DRT) to train certifiably robust
ensemble ML models. Extensive experiments show that our DRT enhanced ensembles
can consistently achieve higher certified robustness than existing single and
ensemble ML models, demonstrating the state-of-the-art certified L2-robustness
on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) provides a regression framework for
adaptively learning a best-fit linear dynamics model over snapshots of
temporal, or spatio-temporal, data. A diversity of regression techniques have
been developed for producing the linear model approximation whose solutions are
exponentials in time. For spatio-temporal data, DMD provides low-rank and
interpretable models in the form of dominant modal structures along with their
exponential/oscillatory behavior in time. The majority of DMD algorithms,
however, are prone to bias errors from noisy measurements of the dynamics,
leading to poor model fits and unstable forecasting capabilities. The optimized
DMD algorithm minimizes the model bias with a variable projection optimization,
thus leading to stabilized forecasting capabilities. Here, the optimized DMD
algorithm is improved by using statistical bagging methods whereby a single set
of snapshots is used to produce an ensemble of optimized DMD models. The
outputs of these models are averaged to produce a bagging, optimized dynamic
mode decomposition (BOP-DMD). BOP-DMD not only improves performance, it also
robustifies the model and provides both spatial and temporal uncertainty
quantification (UQ). Thus unlike currently available DMD algorithms, BOP-DMD
provides a stable and robust model for probabilistic, or Bayesian forecasting
with comprehensive UQ metrics.]]></summary>

disentangle the spatial contents and styles for their separate control.
Although StyleGAN can generate content feature vectors from random noises, the
resulting spatial content control is primarily intended for minor spatial
variations, and the disentanglement of global content and styles is by no means
complete. Inspired by a mathematical understanding of normalization and
attention, here we present a novel hierarchical adaptive Diagonal spatial
ATtention (DAT) layers to separately manipulate the spatial contents from
styles in a hierarchical manner. Using DAT and AdaIN, our method enables
coarse-to-fine level disentanglement of spatial contents and styles. In
addition, our generator can be easily integrated into the GAN inversion
framework so that the content and style of translated images from multi-domain
image translation tasks can be flexibly controlled. By using various datasets,
we confirm that the proposed method not only outperforms the existing models in
disentanglement scores, but also provides more flexible control over spatial
features in the generated images.]]></summary>

expectation of having a single person/instance present in the input bounding
box. This often leads to failures in crowded scenes with occlusions. We propose
a novel solution to overcome the limitations of this fundamental assumption.
Our Multi-Instance Pose Network (MIPNet) allows for predicting multiple 2D pose
instances within a given bounding box. We introduce a Multi-Instance Modulation
Block (MIMB) that can adaptively modulate channel-wise feature responses for
each instance and is parameter efficient. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach by evaluating on COCO, CrowdPose, and OCHuman datasets. Specifically,
we achieve 70.0 AP on CrowdPose and 42.5 AP on OCHuman test sets, a significant
improvement of 2.4 AP and 6.5 AP over the prior art, respectively. When using
ground truth bounding boxes for inference, MIPNet achieves an improvement of
0.7 AP on COCO, 0.9 AP on CrowdPose, and 9.1 AP on OCHuman validation sets
compared to HRNet. Interestingly, when fewer, high confidence bounding boxes
are used, HRNet's performance degrades (by 5 AP) on OCHuman, whereas MIPNet
maintains a relatively stable performance (drop of 1 AP) for the same inputs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to its effectivity and efficiency, deep hashing approaches are widely
used for large-scale visual search. However, it is still challenging to produce
compact and discriminative hash codes for images associated with multiple
semantics for two main reasons, 1) similarity constraints designed in most of
the existing methods are based upon an oversimplified similarity
assignment(i.e., 0 for instance pairs sharing no label, 1 for instance pairs
sharing at least 1 label), 2) the exploration in multi-semantic relevance are
insufficient or even neglected in many of the existing methods. These problems
significantly limit the discrimination of generated hash codes. In this paper,
we propose a novel self-supervised asymmetric deep hashing method with a
margin-scalable constraint(SADH) approach to cope with these problems. SADH
implements a self-supervised network to sufficiently preserve semantic
information in a semantic feature dictionary and a semantic code dictionary for
the semantics of the given dataset, which efficiently and precisely guides a
feature learning network to preserve multilabel semantic information using an
asymmetric learning strategy. By further exploiting semantic dictionaries, a
new margin-scalable constraint is employed for both precise similarity
searching and robust hash code generation. Extensive empirical research on four
popular benchmarks validates the proposed method and shows it outperforms
several state-of-the-art approaches.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved great success due to the
powerful feature learning ability of convolution layers. Specifically, the
standard convolution traverses the input images/features using a sliding window
scheme to extract features. However, not all the windows contribute equally to
the prediction results of CNNs. In practice, the convolutional operation on
some of the windows (e.g., smooth windows that contain very similar pixels) can
be very redundant and may introduce noises into the computation. Such
redundancy may not only deteriorate the performance but also incur the
unnecessary computational cost. Thus, it is important to reduce the
computational redundancy of convolution to improve the performance. To this
end, we propose a Content-aware Convolution (CAC) that automatically detects
the smooth windows and applies a 1x1 convolutional kernel to replace the
original large kernel. In this sense, we are able to effectively avoid the
redundant computation on similar pixels. By replacing the standard convolution
in CNNs with our CAC, the resultant models yield significantly better
performance and lower computational cost than the baseline models with the
standard convolution. More critically, we are able to dynamically allocate
suitable computation resources according to the data smoothness of different
images, making it possible for content-aware computation. Extensive experiments
on various computer vision tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method over
existing methods.]]></summary>

cameras, which when labelled result in a dataset of control transitions and
their corresponding take-over times (TOTs). We then develop and train TOT
models that operate sequentially on mid to high-level features produced by
computer vision algorithms operating on different driver-facing camera views.
The proposed TOT model produces continuous predictions of take-over times

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pretrained deep models hold their learnt knowledge in the form of model
parameters. These parameters act as "memory" for the trained models and help
them generalize well on unseen data. However, in absence of training data, the
utility of a trained model is merely limited to either inference or better
initialization towards a target task. In this paper, we go further and extract
synthetic data by leveraging the learnt model parameters. We dub them "Data
Impressions", which act as proxy to the training data and can be used to
realize a variety of tasks. These are useful in scenarios where only the
pretrained models are available and the training data is not shared (e.g., due
to privacy or sensitivity concerns). We show the applicability of data
impressions in solving several computer vision tasks such as unsupervised
domain adaptation, continual learning as well as knowledge distillation. We
also study the adversarial robustness of lightweight models trained via
knowledge distillation using these data impressions. Further, we demonstrate
the efficacy of data impressions in generating data-free Universal Adversarial
Perturbations (UAPs) with better fooling rates. Extensive experiments performed
on benchmark datasets demonstrate competitive performance achieved using data
impressions in absence of original training data.]]></summary>

time restrictions. There is a large body of work on training dense networks to
yield sparse networks for inference, but this limits the size of the largest
trainable sparse model to that of the largest trainable dense model. In this
paper we introduce a method to train sparse neural networks with a fixed
parameter count and a fixed computational cost throughout training, without
sacrificing accuracy relative to existing dense-to-sparse training methods. Our
method updates the topology of the sparse network during training by using
parameter magnitudes and infrequent gradient calculations. We show that this
approach requires fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) to achieve a given
level of accuracy compared to prior techniques. We demonstrate state-of-the-art
sparse training results on a variety of networks and datasets, including
ResNet-50, MobileNets on Imagenet-2012, and RNNs on WikiText-103. Finally, we
provide some insights into why allowing the topology to change during the
optimization can overcome local minima encountered when the topology remains
static. Code used in our work can be found in github.com/google-research/rigl.]]></summary>

optimization, its convergence on non-smooth ReLU networks still eludes full

will not drift far away from that on averaged model. However, this decent
property does not hold in networks with non-smooth ReLU activation function. We
show that, even though ReLU network does not admit gradient Lipschitzness

will not change too much, under the dynamics of Local SGD. We validate our

label to each action. It has a wide range of applications, and therefore has
been attracting increasing attention in the field of computer vision. Human
actions can be represented using various data modalities, such as RGB,
skeleton, depth, infrared, point cloud, event stream, audio, acceleration,
radar, and WiFi signal, which encode different sources of useful yet distinct
information and have various advantages depending on the application scenarios.
Consequently, lots of existing works have attempted to investigate different
types of approaches for HAR using various modalities. In this paper, we present
a comprehensive survey of recent progress in deep learning methods for HAR
based on the type of input data modality. Specifically, we review the current
mainstream deep learning methods for single data modalities and multiple data
modalities, including the fusion-based and the co-learning-based frameworks. We
also present comparative results on several benchmark datasets for HAR,
together with insightful observations and inspiring future research directions.]]></summary>

call ACORN, to analyze videos of school classrooms for the Positive Climate
(PC) and Negative Climate (NC) dimensions of the CLASS observation protocol
that is widely used in educational research. ACORN uses convolutional neural
networks to analyze spectral audio features, the faces of teachers and
students, and the pixels of each image frame, and then integrates this
information over time using Temporal Convolutional Networks. The audiovisual
ACORN's PC and NC predictions have Pearson correlations of $0.55$ and $0.63$
with ground-truth scores provided by expert CLASS coders on the UVA Toddler
dataset (cross-validation on $n=300$ 15-min video segments), and a purely
auditory ACORN predicts PC and NC with correlations of $0.36$ and $0.41$ on the
MET dataset (test set of $n=2000$ videos segments). These numbers are similar
to inter-coder reliability of human coders. Finally, using Graph Convolutional
Networks we make early strides (AUC=$0.70$) toward predicting the specific
moments (45-90sec clips) when the PC is particularly weak/strong. Our findings
inform the design of automatic classroom observation and also more general
video activity recognition and summary recognition systems.]]></summary>

e.g., Credential Authentication Technology (CAT), used by Transportation
Security Administration (TSA), which is a non-trivial security concern. To
overcome the risks incurred due to morphed presentations, we propose a
wavelet-based morph detection methodology which adopts an end-to-end trainable
soft attention mechanism . Our attention-based deep neural network (DNN)
focuses on the salient Regions of Interest (ROI) which have the most spatial
support for morph detector decision function, i.e, morph class binary softmax
output. A retrospective of morph synthesizing procedure aids us to speculate
the ROI as regions around facial landmarks , particularly for the case of
landmark-based morphing techniques. Moreover, our attention-based DNN is
adapted to the wavelet space, where inputs of the network are coarse-to-fine
spectral representations, 48 stacked wavelet sub-bands to be exact. We evaluate
performance of the proposed framework using three datasets, VISAPP17, LMA, and
MorGAN. In addition, as attention maps can be a robust indicator whether a
probe image under investigation is genuine or counterfeit, we analyze the
estimated attention maps for both a bona fide image and its corresponding
morphed image. Finally, we present an ablation study on the efficacy of
utilizing attention mechanism for the sake of morph detection.]]></summary>

security threats or dangerous situations, in which early detection is crucial.
Novel deep learning-based methods have allowed to develop automatic weapon
detectors with promising results. However, these approaches are mainly based on
visual weapon appearance only. For handguns, body pose may be a useful cue,
especially in cases where the gun is barely visible. In this work, a novel
method is proposed to combine, in a single architecture, both weapon appearance
and human pose information. First, pose keypoints are estimated to extract hand
regions and generate binary pose images, which are the model inputs. Then, each
input is processed in different subnetworks and combined to produce the handgun
bounding box. Results obtained show that the combined model improves the
handgun detection state of the art, achieving from 4.23 to 18.9 AP points more

representations with CNN. Unlike most recent methods that focused on improving
accuracy of image classification, we present a novel contrastive learning
approach, named DetCo, which fully explores the contrasts between global image
and local image patches to learn discriminative representations for object
detection. DetCo has several appealing benefits. (1) It is carefully designed
by investigating the weaknesses of current self-supervised methods, which
discard important representations for object detection. (2) DetCo builds
hierarchical intermediate contrastive losses between global image and local
patches to improve object detection, while maintaining global representations
for image recognition. Theoretical analysis shows that the local patches
actually remove the contextual information of an image, improving the lower
bound of mutual information for better contrastive learning. (3) Extensive
experiments on PASCAL VOC, COCO and Cityscapes demonstrate that DetCo not only
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on object detection, but also on
segmentation, pose estimation, and 3D shape prediction, while it is still
competitive on image classification. For example, on PASCAL VOC, DetCo-100ep
achieves 57.4 mAP, which is on par with the result of MoCov2-800ep. Moreover,
DetCo consistently outperforms supervised method by 1.6/1.2/1.0 AP on Mask

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, segmentation methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
showed promising performance in automatic Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions
segmentation. These techniques have even outperformed human experts in
controlled evaluation conditions such as Longitudinal MS Lesion Segmentation
Challenge (ISBI Challenge). However state-of-the-art approaches trained to
perform well on highly-controlled datasets fail to generalize on clinical data
from unseen datasets. Instead of proposing another improvement of the
segmentation accuracy, we propose a novel method robust to domain shift and
performing well on unseen datasets, called DeepLesionBrain (DLB). This
generalization property results from three main contributions. First, DLB is
based on a large group of compact 3D CNNs. This spatially distributed strategy
ensures a robust prediction despite the risk of generalization failure of some
individual networks. Second, DLB includes a new image quality data augmentation
to reduce dependency to training data specificity (e.g., acquisition protocol).
Finally, to learn a more generalizable representation of MS lesions, we propose
a hierarchical specialization learning (HSL). HSL is performed by pre-training
a generic network over the whole brain, before using its weights as
initialization to locally specialized networks. By this end, DLB learns both
generic features extracted at global image level and specific features
extracted at local image level. DLB generalization was validated in
cross-dataset experiments on MSSEG'16, ISBI challenge, and in-house datasets.
During experiments, DLB showed higher segmentation accuracy, better
segmentation consistency and greater generalization performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Therefore, DLB offers a robust framework well-suited
for clinical practice.]]></summary>

in the computer vision field. Many works focus on how to design efficient
channel attention mechanisms while ignoring a fundamental problem, i.e.,
channel attention mechanism uses scalar to represent channel, which is
difficult due to massive information loss. In this work, we start from a
different view and regard the channel representation problem as a compression
process using frequency analysis. Based on the frequency analysis, we
mathematically prove that the conventional global average pooling is a special
case of the feature decomposition in the frequency domain. With the proof, we
naturally generalize the compression of the channel attention mechanism in the
frequency domain and propose our method with multi-spectral channel attention,
termed as FcaNet. FcaNet is simple but effective. We can change a few lines of
code in the calculation to implement our method within existing channel
attention methods. Moreover, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
results compared with other channel attention methods on image classification,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is common practice to represent spoken languages at their phonetic level.
However, for sign languages, this implies breaking motion into its constituent
motion primitives. Avatar based Sign Language Production (SLP) has
traditionally done just this, building up animation from sequences of hand
motions, shapes and facial expressions. However, more recent deep learning
based solutions to SLP have tackled the problem using a single network that
estimates the full skeletal structure.

We propose splitting the SLP task into two distinct jointly-trained
sub-tasks. The first translation sub-task translates from spoken language to a
latent sign language representation, with gloss supervision. Subsequently, the
animation sub-task aims to produce expressive sign language sequences that
closely resemble the learnt spatio-temporal representation. Using a progressive
transformer for the translation sub-task, we propose a novel Mixture of Motion
Primitives (MoMP) architecture for sign language animation. A set of distinct
motion primitives are learnt during training, that can be temporally combined
at inference to animate continuous sign language sequences.

We evaluate on the challenging RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T(PHOENIX14T)
dataset, presenting extensive ablation studies and showing that MoMP
outperforms baselines in user evaluations. We achieve state-of-the-art back
translation performance with an 11% improvement over competing results.
Importantly, and for the first time, we showcase stronger performance for a
full translation pipeline going from spoken language to sign, than from gloss
to sign.]]></summary>

statistics of the convolutional feature. Its effectiveness has been
demonstrated in boosting the classification performance of Convolutional Neural

the matrix square root. However, the approximate matrix square root calculated
using Newton-Schulz iteration \cite{li2018towards} outperforms the accurate one

the performance gap from the perspectives of data precision and gradient
smoothness. Various remedies for computing smooth SVD gradients are
investigated. Based on our observation and analyses, a hybrid training protocol
is proposed for SVD-based GCP meta-layers such that competitive performances
can be achieved against Newton-Schulz iteration. Moreover, we propose a new GCP
meta-layer that uses SVD in the forward pass, and Pad\'e Approximants in the

with the advent of large-scale autonomous driving datasets. However, drastic
performance degradation remains a critical challenge for cross-domain
deployment. In addition, existing 3D domain adaptive detection methods often
assume prior access to the target domain annotations, which is rarely feasible
in the real world. To address this challenge, we study a more realistic
setting, unsupervised 3D domain adaptive detection, which only utilizes source
domain annotations. 1) We first comprehensively investigate the major
underlying factors of the domain gap in 3D detection. Our key insight is that
geometric mismatch is the key factor of domain shift. 2) Then, we propose a
novel and unified framework, Multi-Level Consistency Network (MLC-Net), which
employs a teacher-student paradigm to generate adaptive and reliable
pseudo-targets. MLC-Net exploits point-, instance- and neural statistics-level
consistency to facilitate cross-domain transfer. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLC-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
(including those using additional target domain information) on standard
benchmarks. Notably, our approach is detector-agnostic, which achieves
consistent gains on both single- and two-stage 3D detectors.]]></summary>

understanding. While dense labeling on 3D data is expensive and time-consuming,
only a few works address weakly supervised semantic point cloud segmentation
methods to relieve the labeling cost by learning from simpler and cheaper
labels. Meanwhile, there are still huge performance gaps between existing
weakly supervised methods and state-of-the-art fully supervised methods. In
this paper, we train a semantic point cloud segmentation network with only a
small portion of points being labeled. We argue that we can better utilize the
limited supervision information as we densely propagate the supervision signal
from the labeled points to other points within and across the input samples.
Specifically, we propose a cross-sample feature reallocating module to transfer
similar features and therefore re-route the gradients across two samples with
common classes and an intra-sample feature redistribution module to propagate
supervision signals on unlabeled points across and within point cloud samples.
We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets S3DIS and ScanNet. Our
weakly supervised method with only 10\% and 1\% of labels can produce
compatible results with the fully supervised counterpart.]]></summary>

cycling conditions and conflate them in a quantitative index. Much research
involves site visits or conventional geospatial approaches, and few studies
have leveraged street view imagery (SVI) for conducting virtual audits. These
have assessed a limited range of aspects, and not all have been automated using
computer vision (CV). Furthermore, studies have not yet zeroed in on gauging
the usability of these technologies thoroughly. We investigate, with
experiments at a fine spatial scale and across multiple geographies (Singapore
and Tokyo), whether we can use SVI and CV to assess bikeability
comprehensively. Extending related work, we develop an exhaustive index of
bikeability composed of 34 indicators. The results suggest that SVI and CV are
adequate to evaluate bikeability in cities comprehensively. As they
outperformed non-SVI counterparts by a wide margin, SVI indicators are also
found to be superior in assessing urban bikeability, and potentially can be
used independently, replacing traditional techniques. However, the paper
exposes some limitations, suggesting that the best way forward is combining
both SVI and non-SVI approaches. The new bikeability index presents a
contribution in transportation and urban analytics, and it is scalable to
assess cycling appeal widely.]]></summary>

The availability of longitudinal CT series may also result in an efficient and

healing process and the response to different therapeutic strategies. In this
paper, we propose a new framework to identify infection at a voxel level

and storage requirements of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Efforts toward
creating ultra-low-precision (sub-8-bit) DNNs suggest that the minimum
precision required to achieve a given network-level accuracy varies
considerably across networks, and even across layers within a network,
requiring support for variable precision in DNN hardware. Previous proposals
such as bit-serial hardware incur high overheads, significantly diminishing the
benefits of lower precision. To efficiently support precision
re-configurability in DNN accelerators, we introduce an approximate computing
method wherein DNN computations are performed block-wise (a block is a group of
bits) and re-configurability is supported at the granularity of blocks. Results
of block-wise computations are composed in an approximate manner to enable
efficient re-configurability. We design a DNN accelerator that embodies
approximate blocked computation and propose a method to determine a suitable
approximation configuration for a given DNN. By varying the approximation
configurations across DNNs, we achieve 1.17x-1.73x and 1.02x-2.04x improvement
in system energy and performance respectively, over an 8-bit fixed-point (FxP8)
baseline, with negligible loss in classification accuracy. Further, by varying
the approximation configurations across layers and data-structures within DNNs,
we achieve 1.25x-2.42x and 1.07x-2.95x improvement in system energy and
performance respectively, with negligible accuracy loss.]]></summary>

identifying dogs on roads) is crucial in safety-critical applications. Existing
approaches use images of unexpected objects from external datasets or require
additional training (e.g., retraining segmentation networks or training an
extra network), which necessitate a non-trivial amount of labor intensity or
lengthy inference time. One possible alternative is to use prediction scores of
a pre-trained network such as the max logits (i.e., maximum values among
classes before the final softmax layer) for detecting such objects. However,
the distribution of max logits of each predicted class is significantly
different from each other, which degrades the performance of identifying
unexpected objects in urban-scene segmentation. To address this issue, we
propose a simple yet effective approach that standardizes the max logits in
order to align the different distributions and reflect the relative meanings of
max logits within each predicted class. Moreover, we consider the local regions
from two different perspectives based on the intuition that neighboring pixels
share similar semantic information. In contrast to previous approaches, our
method does not utilize any external datasets or require additional training,
which makes our method widely applicable to existing pre-trained segmentation
models. Such a straightforward approach achieves a new state-of-the-art
performance on the publicly available Fishyscapes Lost & Found leaderboard with
a large margin.]]></summary>

role in financing climate mitigation, forest conservation, and reforestation.
Measuring how much carbon is stored in forests is, however, still largely done
via expensive, time-consuming, and sometimes unaccountable field measurements.
To overcome these limitations, many verification bodies are leveraging machine
learning (ML) algorithms to estimate forest carbon from satellite or aerial
imagery. Aerial imagery allows for tree species or family classification, which
improves the satellite imagery-based forest type classification. However,
aerial imagery is significantly more expensive to collect and it is unclear by
how much the higher resolution improves the forest carbon estimation. This
proposal paper describes the first systematic comparison of forest carbon
estimation from aerial imagery, satellite imagery, and ground-truth field
measurements via deep learning-based algorithms for a tropical reforestation
project. Our initial results show that forest carbon estimates from satellite
imagery can overestimate above-ground biomass by more than 10-times for
tropical reforestation projects. The significant difference between aerial and
satellite-derived forest carbon measurements shows the potential for aerial
imagery-based ML algorithms and raises the importance to extend this study to a
global benchmark between options for carbon measurements.]]></summary>

powerful, which enabled technologies such as autonomous driving to evolve with
rapid pace. However, current algorithms mainly share one limitation: They rely
on directly visible objects. This is a major drawback compared to human
behavior, where indirect visual cues caused by the actual object (e.g.,
shadows) are already used intuitively to retrieve information or anticipate
occurring objects. While driving at night, this performance deficit becomes
even more obvious: Humans already process the light artifacts caused by
oncoming vehicles to assume their future appearance, whereas current object
detection systems rely on the oncoming vehicle's direct visibility. Based on
previous work in this subject, we present with this paper a complete system
capable of solving the task to providently detect oncoming vehicles at
nighttime based on their caused light artifacts. For that, we outline the full
algorithm architecture ranging from the detection of light artifacts in the
image space, localizing the objects in the three-dimensional space, and
verifying the objects over time. To demonstrate the applicability, we deploy
the system in a test vehicle and use the information of providently detected
vehicles to control the glare-free high beam system proactively. Using this
experimental setting, we quantify the time benefit that the provident vehicle
detection system provides compared to an in-production computer vision system.
Additionally, the glare-free high beam use case provides a real-time and
real-world visualization interface of the detection results. With this
contribution, we want to put awareness on the unconventional sensing task of
provident object detection and further close the performance gap between human
behavior and computer vision algorithms in order to bring autonomous and
automated driving a step forward.]]></summary>

domains with the assumption that images share content (e.g., pose) but have
their own domain-specific information known as style. When conditioned on a
target image, such methods aim to extract the style of the target and combine
it with the content of the source image. In this work, we consider the scenario
where the target image has a very low resolution. More specifically, our
approach aims at transferring fine details from a high resolution (HR) source
image to fit a coarse, low resolution (LR) image representation of the target.
We therefore generate HR images that share features from both HR and LR inputs.
This differs from previous methods that focus on translating a given image
style into a target content, our translation approach being able to
simultaneously imitate the style and merge the structural information of the LR
target. Our approach relies on training the generative model to produce HR
target images that both 1) share distinctive information of the associated
source image; 2) correctly match the LR target image when downscaled. We
validate our method on the CelebA-HQ and AFHQ datasets by demonstrating
improvements in terms of visual quality, diversity and coverage. Qualitative

translation, our method generates more realistic samples compared to

navigation tasks. However, navigators trained with limited human-annotated
instructions may have difficulties in accurately capturing key information from
the complicated instruction at different timesteps, leading to poor navigation
performance. In this paper, we exploit to train a more robust navigator which
is capable of dynamically extracting crucial factors from the long instruction,
by using an adversarial attacking paradigm. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic
Reinforced Instruction Attacker (DR-Attacker), which learns to mislead the
navigator to move to the wrong target by destroying the most instructive
information in instructions at different timesteps. By formulating the
perturbation generation as a Markov Decision Process, DR-Attacker is optimized
by the reinforcement learning algorithm to generate perturbed instructions
sequentially during the navigation, according to a learnable attack score.
Then, the perturbed instructions, which serve as hard samples, are used for
improving the robustness of the navigator with an effective adversarial
training strategy and an auxiliary self-supervised reasoning task. Experimental
results on both Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) and Navigation from Dialog
History (NDH) tasks show the superiority of our proposed method over
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the visualization analysis shows the
effectiveness of the proposed DR-Attacker, which can successfully attack

under poor lighting conditions by using the high visibility areas from these
modalities together. The vital assumption for the combination use is that there
is no or only a weak misalignment between the two modalities. In general,
however, this assumption often breaks in actual situations. Due to this
assumption's breakdown, the position of the bounding boxes does not match
between the two modalities, resulting in a significant decrease in detection
accuracy, especially in regions where the amount of misalignment is large. In
this paper, we propose a multi-modal Faster-RCNN that is robust against large
misalignment. The keys are 1) modal-wise regression and 2) multi-modal IoU for
mini-batch sampling. To deal with large misalignment, we perform bounding box
regression for both the RPN and detection-head with both modalities. We also
propose a new sampling strategy called "multi-modal mini-batch sampling" that
integrates the IoU for both modalities. We demonstrate that the proposed
method's performance is much better than that of the state-of-the-art methods

supervision. At the core of our method is the fundamental observation that GANs
are incredibly successful at encoding semantic information within their latent
space, even in a completely unsupervised setting. For modern generative
frameworks, this semantic encoding manifests as smooth, linear directions which
affect image attributes in a disentangled manner. These directions have been
widely used in GAN-based image editing. We show that such directions are not
only linear, but that the magnitude of change induced on the respective
attribute is approximately linear with respect to the distance traveled along
them. By leveraging this observation, our method turns a pre-trained GAN into a
regression model, using as few as two labeled samples. This enables solving
regression tasks on datasets and attributes which are difficult to produce
quality supervision for. Additionally, we show that the same latent-distances
can be used to sort collections of images by the strength of given attributes,
even in the absence of explicit supervision. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our method can be applied across a wide range of domains,
leverage multiple latent direction discovery frameworks, and achieve
state-of-the-art results in few-shot and low-supervision settings, even when

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep neural network approaches to inverse imaging problems have produced
impressive results in the last few years. In this paper, we consider the use of
generative models in a variational regularisation approach to inverse problems.
The considered regularisers penalise images that are far from the range of a
generative model that has learned to produce images similar to a training
dataset. We name this family \textit{generative regularisers}. The success of
generative regularisers depends on the quality of the generative model and so
we propose a set of desired criteria to assess models and guide future
research. In our numerical experiments, we evaluate three common generative
models, autoencoders, variational autoencoders and generative adversarial
networks, against our desired criteria. We also test three different generative
regularisers on the inverse problems of deblurring, deconvolution, and
tomography. We show that the success of solutions restricted to lie exactly in
the range of the generator is highly dependent on the ability of the generative
model but that allowing small deviations from the range of the generator
produces more consistent results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have witnessed exceptional
improvements in performance in recent years. However, they still fail to
provide the same predictive power as CNNs with a large number of parameters.
The diverse and even abundant features captured by the layers is an important
characteristic of these successful CNNs. However, differences in this
characteristic between large CNNs and their compact counterparts have rarely
been investigated. In compact CNNs, due to the limited number of parameters,
abundant features are unlikely to be obtained, and feature diversity becomes an
essential characteristic. Diverse features present in the activation maps
derived from a data point during model inference may indicate the presence of a
set of unique descriptors necessary to distinguish between objects of different
classes. In contrast, data points with low feature diversity may not provide a
sufficient amount of unique descriptors to make a valid prediction; we refer to
them as random predictions. Random predictions can negatively impact the
optimization process and harm the final performance. This paper proposes
addressing the problem raised by random predictions by reshaping the standard
cross-entropy to make it biased toward data points with a limited number of
unique descriptive features. Our novel Bias Loss focuses the training on a set
of valuable data points and prevents the vast number of samples with poor
learning features from misleading the optimization process. Furthermore, to
show the importance of diversity, we present a family of SkipNet models whose
architectures are brought to boost the number of unique descriptors in the last
layers. Our Skipnet-M can achieve 1% higher classification accuracy than
MobileNetV3 Large.]]></summary>

hardware technology, implementing shallow neural networks on the so-called
Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices has attracted a lot of
interest. Many quantum (convolutional) circuit ansaetze are proposed for
grayscale images classification tasks with promising empirical results.
However, when applying these ansaetze on RGB images, the intra-channel
information that is useful for vision tasks is not extracted effectively. In
this paper, we propose two types of quantum circuit ansaetze to simulate
convolution operations on RGB images, which differ in the way how inter-channel
and intra-channel information are extracted. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work of a quantum convolutional circuit to deal with RGB images
effectively, with a higher test accuracy compared to the purely classical CNNs.
We also investigate the relationship between the size of quantum circuit ansatz
and the learnability of the hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural
network. Through experiments based on CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets, we
demonstrate that a larger size of the quantum circuit ansatz improves
predictive performance in multiclass classification tasks, providing useful
insights for near term quantum algorithm developments.]]></summary>

with realistic contents. The prevalent approaches adopt a hybrid objective of
reconstruction and perceptual quality by using generative adversarial networks.
However, the reconstruction loss and adversarial loss focus on synthesizing
contents of different frequencies and simply applying them together often leads
to inter-frequency conflicts and compromised inpainting. This paper presents
WaveFill, a wavelet-based inpainting network that decomposes images into
multiple frequency bands and fills the missing regions in each frequency band
separately and explicitly. WaveFill decomposes images by using discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) that preserves spatial information naturally. It applies L1
reconstruction loss to the decomposed low-frequency bands and adversarial loss
to high-frequency bands, hence effectively mitigate inter-frequency conflicts
while completing images in spatial domain. To address the inpainting
inconsistency in different frequency bands and fuse features with distinct
statistics, we design a novel normalization scheme that aligns and fuses the
multi-frequency features effectively. Extensive experiments over multiple
datasets show that WaveFill achieves superior image inpainting qualitatively
and quantitatively.]]></summary>

computer vision. Recently, deep learning models have achieved great progress
towards learning discriminative features from input images. However,
conventional approaches are unable to model the inter-class discrepancies among
features in multi-label images, since they are designed to work for image-level
feature discrimination. In this paper, we propose a unified deep network to
learn discriminative features for the multi-label task. Given a multi-label
image, the proposed method first disentangles features corresponding to
different classes. Then, it discriminates between these classes via increasing
the inter-class distance while decreasing the intra-class differences in the
output space. By regularizing the whole network with the proposed loss, the
performance of applying the wellknown ResNet-101 is improved significantly.
Extensive experiments have been performed on COCO-2014, VOC2007 and VOC2012
datasets, which demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin of 3:5% on large-scale COCO
dataset. Moreover, analysis of the discriminative feature learning approach
shows that it can be plugged into various types of multi-label methods as a
general module.]]></summary>

popularity since it can transfer knowledge from simulation to real (Sim2Real)
by largely cutting out the laborious per pixel labeling efforts at real. In
this work, we present a new video extension of this task, namely Unsupervised
Domain Adaptation for Video Semantic Segmentation. As it became easy to obtain
large-scale video labels through simulation, we believe attempting to maximize
Sim2Real knowledge transferability is one of the promising directions for
resolving the fundamental data-hungry issue in the video. To tackle this new
problem, we present a novel two-phase adaptation scheme. In the first step, we
exhaustively distill source domain knowledge using supervised loss functions.
Simultaneously, video adversarial training (VAT) is employed to align the
features from source to target utilizing video context. In the second step, we
apply video self-training (VST), focusing only on the target data. To construct
robust pseudo labels, we exploit the temporal information in the video, which
has been rarely explored in the previous image-based self-training approaches.
We set strong baseline scores on 'VIPER to CityscapeVPS' adaptation scenario.
We show that our proposals significantly outperform previous image-based UDA
methods both on image-level (mIoU) and video-level (VPQ) evaluation metrics.]]></summary>

infers a continuous probability density function (PDF) from discrete samples.
Thus, it is used in tasks as diverse as analyzing population data, spatial

this paper, we introduce a learned, data-driven deep density estimation (DDE)
to infer PDFs in an accurate and efficient manner, while being independent of
domain dimensionality or sample size. Furthermore, we do not require access to
the original PDF during estimation, neither in parametric form, nor as priors,
or in the form of many samples. This is enabled by training an unstructured
convolutional neural network on an infinite stream of synthetic PDFs, as
unbound amounts of synthetic training data generalize better across a deck of
natural PDFs than any natural finite training data will do. Thus, we hope that
our publicly available DDE method will be beneficial in many areas of data

robot-assisted surgery can contribute to documenting entry tasks and
post-operative analysis. Despite the impressive outcome, the deep learning
model degrades the performance when applied to different domains encountering
domain shifts. In addition, there are new instruments and variations in
surgical tissues appeared in robotic surgery. In this work, we propose
class-incremental domain adaptation (CIDA) with a multi-layer transformer-based
model to tackle the new classes and domain shift in the target domain to
generate surgical reports during robotic surgery. To adapt incremental classes
and extract domain invariant features, a class-incremental (CI) learning method
with supervised contrastive (SupCon) loss is incorporated with a feature
extractor. To generate caption from the extracted feature, curriculum by
one-dimensional gaussian smoothing (CBS) is integrated with a multi-layer
transformer-based caption prediction model. CBS smoothes the features embedding
using anti-aliasing and helps the model to learn domain invariant features. We
also adopt label smoothing (LS) to calibrate prediction probability and obtain
better feature representation with both feature extractor and captioning model.
The proposed techniques are empirically evaluated by using the datasets of two
surgical domains, such as nephrectomy operations and transoral robotic surgery.
We observe that domain invariant feature learning and the well-calibrated
network improves the surgical report generation performance in both source and
target domain under domain shift and unseen classes in the manners of one-shot
and few-shot learning. The code is publicly available at

assigned for a facial image to express a compound emotion, which effectively
improves the problem of label uncertainties and noises occurred in one-hot
labels. In practice, it is observed that correlations among emotions are
inherently different, such as surprised and happy emotions are more possibly
synchronized than surprised and neutral. It indicates the correlation may be
crucial for obtaining a reliable label distribution. Based on this, we propose
a new method that amends the label distribution of each facial image by
leveraging correlations among expressions in the semantic space. Inspired by
inherently diverse correlations among word2vecs, the topological information
among facial expressions is firstly explored in the semantic space, and each
image is embedded into the semantic space. Specially, a class-relation graph is
constructed to transfer the semantic correlation among expressions into the
task space. By comparing semantic and task class-relation graphs of each image,
the confidence of its label distribution is evaluated. Based on the confidence,
the label distribution is amended by enhancing samples with higher confidence
and weakening samples with lower confidence. Experimental results demonstrate
the proposed method is more effective than compared state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

shift and conditional shift assumptions, which essentially encourage models to
learn common features across domains. However, due to the lack of supervision
in the target domain, they suffer from the semantic loss: the feature will
inevitably lose non-discriminative semantics in source domain, which is however
discriminative in target domain. We use a causal view -- transportability
theory -- to identify that such loss is in fact a confounding effect, which can
only be removed by causal intervention. However, the theoretical solution
provided by transportability is far from practical for UDA, because it requires
the stratification and representation of an unobserved confounder that is the
cause of the domain gap. To this end, we propose a practical solution:
Transporting Causal Mechanisms (TCM), to identify the confounder stratum and
representations by using the domain-invariant disentangled causal mechanisms,
which are discovered in an unsupervised fashion. Our TCM is both theoretically
and empirically grounded. Extensive experiments show that TCM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three challenging UDA benchmarks: ImageCLEF-DA,
Office-Home, and VisDA-2017. Codes are available in Appendix.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3D shape reconstruction is essential in the navigation of minimally-invasive
and auto robot-guided surgeries whose operating environments are indirect and
narrow, and there have been some works that focused on reconstructing the 3D
shape of the surgical organ through limited 2D information available. However,
the lack and incompleteness of such information caused by intraoperative
emergencies (such as bleeding) and risk control conditions have not been
considered. In this paper, a novel hierarchical shape-perception network (HSPN)
is proposed to reconstruct the 3D point clouds (PCs) of specific brains from
one single incomplete image with low latency. A tree-structured predictor and
several hierarchical attention pipelines are constructed to generate point
clouds that accurately describe the incomplete images and then complete these
point clouds with high quality. Meanwhile, attention gate blocks (AGBs) are
designed to efficiently aggregate geometric local features of incomplete PCs
transmitted by hierarchical attention pipelines and internal features of
reconstructing point clouds. With the proposed HSPN, 3D shape perception and
completion can be achieved spontaneously. Comprehensive results measured by
Chamfer distance and PC-to-PC error demonstrate that the performance of the
proposed HSPN outperforms other competitive methods in terms of qualitative
displays, quantitative experiment, and classification evaluation.]]></summary>

In particular, we utilize two auxiliary classification layers that learn
tighter decision boundaries by maximizing the discrepancies among them.
Intuitively, the discrepancies in the auxiliary classification layers'
predictions indicate the uncertainty in the prediction. In this regard, we
propose a novel method to leverage the classifier discrepancies for the
acquisition function for active learning. We also provide an interpretation of
our idea in relation to existing GAN based active learning methods and domain

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We consider unsupervised cell nuclei segmentation in this paper. Exploiting
the recently-proposed unpaired image-to-image translation between cell nuclei
images and randomly synthetic masks, existing approaches, e.g., CycleGAN, have
achieved encouraging results. However, these methods usually take a two-stage
pipeline and fail to learn end-to-end in cell nuclei images. More seriously,
they could lead to the lossy transformation problem, i.e., the content
inconsistency between the original images and the corresponding segmentation
output. To address these limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end
unsupervised framework called Aligned Disentangling Generative Adversarial
Network (AD-GAN). Distinctively, AD-GAN introduces representation
disentanglement to separate content representation (the underling spatial
structure) from style representation (the rendering of the structure). With
this framework, spatial structure can be preserved explicitly, enabling a
significant reduction of macro-level lossy transformation. We also propose a
novel training algorithm able to align the disentangled content in the latent
space to reduce micro-level lossy transformation. Evaluations on real-world 2D
and 3D datasets show that AD-GAN substantially outperforms the other comparison
methods and the professional software both quantitatively and qualitatively.
Specifically, the proposed AD-GAN leads to significant improvement over the
current best unsupervised methods by an average 17.8% relatively (w.r.t. the
metric DICE) on four cell nuclei datasets. As an unsupervised method, AD-GAN
even performs competitive with the best supervised models, taking a further
leap towards end-to-end unsupervised nuclei segmentation.]]></summary>

firefighters in emergency first response settings. First, we used a deep
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) system to classify and identify objects of
interest from thermal imagery in real-time. Next, we extended this CNN
framework for object detection, tracking, segmentation with a Mask RCNN
framework, and scene description with a multimodal natural language
processing(NLP) framework. Third, we built a deep Q-learning-based agent,
immune to stress-induced disorientation and anxiety, capable of making clear
navigation decisions based on the observed and stored facts in live-fire
environments. Finally, we used a low computational unsupervised learning
technique called tensor decomposition to perform meaningful feature extraction
for anomaly detection in real-time. With these ad-hoc deep learning structures,
we built the artificial intelligence system's backbone for firefighters'
situational awareness. To bring the designed system into usage by firefighters,
we designed a physical structure where the processed results are used as inputs
in the creation of an augmented reality capable of advising firefighters of
their location and key features around them, which are vital to the rescue
operation at hand, as well as a path planning feature that acts as a virtual
guide to assist disoriented first responders in getting back to safety. When

desired text while preserving an original style, is a challenging task due to a
complex intervention between text and style. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel representational learning-based STE model, referred to as
RewriteNet that employs textual information as well as visual information. We
assume that the scene text image can be decomposed into content and style
features where the former represents the text information and style represents
scene text characteristics such as font, alignment, and background. Under this
assumption, we propose a method to separately encode content and style features
of the input image by introducing the scene text recognizer that is trained by
text information. Then, a text-edited image is generated by combining the style
feature from the original image and the content feature from the target text.
Unlike previous works that are only able to use synthetic images in the
training phase, we also exploit real-world images by proposing a
self-supervised training scheme, which bridges the domain gap between synthetic

quantitative and qualitative performance than other comparisons. Moreover, we

Sensing Imaging (CSI) is a challenging problem and has many practical
applications. Recently, deep neural networks have been applied to this problem
with promising results, owing to its implicitly learned prior to alleviate the
ill-poseness of CSI. However, existing neural network approaches require
separate models for each imaging parameter like sampling ratios, leading to
training difficulties and overfitting to specific settings. In this paper, we
present a dynamic proximal unrolling network (dubbed DPUNet), which can handle
a variety of measurement matrices via one single model without retraining.
Specifically, DPUNet can exploit both embedded physical model via gradient
descent and imposing image prior with learned dynamic proximal mapping leading
to joint reconstruction. A key component of DPUNet is a dynamic proximal
mapping module, whose parameters can be dynamically adjusted at inference stage
and make it adapt to any given imaging setting. Experimental results

occupancy values have enabled high-fidelity implicit representations of object
shape. This paper develops a new shape model that allows synthesizing novel
distance views by optimizing a continuous signed directional distance function
(SDDF). Similar to deep SDF models, our SDDF formulation can represent whole
categories of shapes and complete or interpolate across shapes from partial
input data. Unlike an SDF, which measures distance to the nearest surface in
any direction, an SDDF measures distance in a given direction. This allows
training an SDDF model without 3D shape supervision, using only distance
measurements, readily available from depth camera or Lidar sensors. Our model
also removes post-processing steps like surface extraction or rendering by
directly predicting distance at arbitrary locations and viewing directions.
Unlike deep view-synthesis techniques, such as Neural Radiance Fields, which
train high-capacity black-box models, our model encodes by construction the
property that SDDF values decrease linearly along the viewing direction. This
structure constraint not only results in dimensionality reduction but also
provides analytical confidence about the accuracy of SDDF predictions,

inference. We propose photon scale-space a collection of high-SNR images
spanning a wide range of photons-per-pixel (PPP) levels (but same scene
content) as guides to train inference model on low photon flux images. We
develop training techniques that push images with different illumination levels
closer to each other in feature representation space. The key idea is that
having a spectrum of different brightness levels during training enables
effective guidance, and increases robustness to shot noise even in extreme
noise cases. Based on the proposed approach, we demonstrate, via simulations
and real experiments with a SPAD camera, high-performance on various inference
tasks such as image classification and monocular depth estimation under ultra
low-light, down to < 1 PPP.]]></summary>

are hard to segment or classify due to their lack of precise boundaries, and
there is limited data available for training deep neural networks. As such,
current solutions for this problem employ rigid synthetic datasets, which lack
flexibility and lead to severe performance degradation when deployed on
real-world scenarios. In particular, these synthetic datasets omit features
such as refraction, dispersion and caustics due to limitations in the rendering
pipeline. To address this issue, we present SuperCaustics, a real-time,
open-source simulation of transparent objects designed for deep learning
applications. SuperCaustics features extensive modules for stochastic
environment creation; uses hardware ray-tracing to support caustics,
dispersion, and refraction; and enables generating massive datasets with
multi-modal, pixel-perfect ground truth annotations. To validate our proposed
system, we trained a deep neural network from scratch to segment transparent
objects in difficult lighting scenarios. Our neural network achieved
performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on a real-world dataset using
only 10% of the training data and in a fraction of the training time. Further
experiments show that a model trained with SuperCaustics can segment different
types of caustics, even in images with multiple overlapping transparent
objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such result for a
model trained on synthetic data. Both our open-source code and experimental
data are freely available online.]]></summary>

which affects downstream tasks such as surface reconstruction and analysis. The
distribution of a noisy point cloud can be viewed as the distribution of a set

$(p * n)(x)$ whose mode is the underlying clean surface. To denoise a noisy

the log-probability function) to perform gradient ascent, we propose a neural
network architecture to estimate the score of $p * n$ given only noisy point

develop a denoising algorithm leveraging on the estimated scores. Experiments

localization/navigation of planetary rovers/UAVs and virtual/augmented reality
applications. We present a novel mountainous skyline detection approach where
we adapt a shallow learning approach to learn a set of filters to discriminate
between edges belonging to sky-mountain boundary and others coming from
different regions. Unlike earlier approaches, which either rely on extraction
of explicit feature descriptors and their classification, or fine-tuning
general scene parsing deep networks for sky segmentation, our approach learns
linear filters based on local structure analysis. At test time, for every
candidate edge pixel, a single filter is chosen from the set of learned filters
based on pixel's structure tensor, and then applied to the patch around it. We
then employ dynamic programming to solve the shortest path problem for the
resultant multistage graph to get the sky-mountain boundary. The proposed
approach is computationally faster than earlier methods while providing
comparable performance and is more suitable for resource constrained platforms
e.g., mobile devices, planetary rovers and UAVs. We compare our proposed
approach against earlier skyline detection methods using four different data

VC system with explicit prosodic modelling and deep speaker embedding (DSE)

from atypical speech. Second, a prosody corrector takes in phoneme embeddings
to infer typical phoneme duration and pitch values. Third, a conversion model
takes phoneme embeddings and typical prosody features as inputs to generate the
converted speech, conditioned on the target DSE that is learned via speaker
encoder or speaker adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that speaker
adaptation can achieve higher speaker similarity, and the speaker encoder based
conversion model can greatly reduce dysarthric and non-native pronunciation
patterns with improved speech intelligibility. A comparison of speech
recognition results between the original dysarthric speech and converted speech
show that absolute reduction of 47.6% character error rate (CER) and 29.3% word

in optical flow estimation. However, downsampling in feature pyramids can cause
blending of foreground objects with the background, which will mislead
subsequent decisions in the iterative processing. The results are missing
details especially in the flow of thin and of small structures. We propose a
novel Residual Feature Pyramid Module (RFPM) which retains important details in
the feature map without changing the overall iterative refinement design of the
optical flow estimation. RFPM incorporates a residual structure between
multiple feature pyramids into a downsampling module that corrects the blending
of objects across boundaries. We demonstrate how to integrate our module with
two state-of-the-art iterative refinement architectures. Results show that our
RFPM visibly reduces flow errors and improves state-of-art performance in the
clean pass of Sintel, and is one of the top-performing methods in KITTI.
According to the particular modular structure of RFPM, we introduce a special
transfer learning approach that can dramatically decrease the training time

applications of computer vision such as mobile robotics or autonomous driving.
To deal with the inverse problem of reconstructing 3D objects from their 2D
projections, a common strategy is to incorporate prior object knowledge into
the reconstruction approach by establishing a 3D model and aligning it to the
2D image plane. However, current approaches are limited due to inadequate shape
priors and the insufficiency of the derived image observations for a reliable
alignment with the 3D model. The goal of this paper is to show how 3D object
reconstruction can profit from a more sophisticated shape prior and from a
combined incorporation of different observation types inferred from the images.
We introduce a subcategory-aware deformable vehicle model that makes use of a
prediction of the vehicle type for a more appropriate regularisation of the
vehicle shape. A multi-branch CNN is presented to derive predictions of the
vehicle type and orientation. This information is also introduced as prior
information for model fitting. Furthermore, the CNN extracts vehicle keypoints
and wireframes, which are well-suited for model-to-image association and model
fitting. The task of pose estimation and reconstruction is addressed by a
versatile probabilistic model. Extensive experiments are conducted using two
challenging real-world data sets on both of which the benefit of the developed
shape prior can be shown. A comparison to state-of-the-art methods for vehicle
pose estimation shows that the proposed approach performs on par or better,
confirming the suitability of the developed shape prior and probabilistic model
for vehicle reconstruction.]]></summary>

adversarial examples, which aim to mislead DNNs by adding perturbations with
small magnitude. To defend against such attacks, both empirical and theoretical
defense approaches have been extensively studied for a single ML model. In this
work, we aim to analyze and provide the certified robustness for ensemble ML
models, together with the sufficient and necessary conditions of robustness for
different ensemble protocols. Although ensemble models are shown more robust
than a single model empirically; surprisingly, we find that in terms of the
certified robustness the standard ensemble models only achieve marginal
improvement compared to a single model. Thus, to explore the conditions that
guarantee to provide certifiably robust ensemble ML models, we first prove that
diversified gradient and large confidence margin are sufficient and necessary
conditions for certifiably robust ensemble models under the model-smoothness
assumption. We then provide the bounded model-smoothness analysis based on the
proposed Ensemble-before-Smoothing strategy. We also prove that an ensemble
model can always achieve higher certified robustness than a single base model
under mild conditions. Inspired by the theoretical findings, we propose the
lightweight Diversity Regularized Training (DRT) to train certifiably robust
ensemble ML models. Extensive experiments show that our DRT enhanced ensembles
can consistently achieve higher certified robustness than existing single and

intelligible and natural speech given text, is a hot research topic in speech,
language, and machine learning communities and has broad applications in the
industry. As the development of deep learning and artificial intelligence,
neural network-based TTS has significantly improved the quality of synthesized
speech in recent years. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on
neural TTS, aiming to provide a good understanding of current research and
future trends. We focus on the key components in neural TTS, including text
analysis, acoustic models and vocoders, and several advanced topics, including
fast TTS, low-resource TTS, robust TTS, expressive TTS, and adaptive TTS, etc.
We further summarize resources related to TTS (e.g., datasets, opensource
implementations) and discuss future research directions. This survey can serve
both academic researchers and industry practitioners working on TTS.]]></summary>

arbitrary human poses and transferring poses of one person to others. However,
most existing approaches explicitly leverage the pose information extracted
from the source images as a conditional input for the generative networks.
Meanwhile, they usually focus on the visual fidelity of the synthesized images
but neglect the inherent consistency, which further confines their performance
of pose transfer. To alleviate the current limitations and improve the quality
of the synthesized images, we propose a pose transfer network with Disentangled
Feature Consistency (DFC-Net) to facilitate human pose transfer. Given a pair
of images containing the source and target person, DFC-Net extracts pose and
static information from the source and target respectively, then synthesizes an
image of the target person with the desired pose from the source. Moreover,
DFC-Net leverages disentangled feature consistency losses in the adversarial
training to strengthen the transfer coherence and integrates the keypoint
amplifier to enhance the pose feature extraction. Additionally, an unpaired
support dataset Mixamo-Sup providing more extra pose information has been
further utilized during the training to improve the generality and robustness
of DFC-Net. Extensive experimental results on Mixamo-Pose and EDN-10k have
demonstrated DFC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on pose transfer.]]></summary>

machine learning on a large scale, efficient and general algorithms must be
designed to intelligently split crop fields into small, yet actionable,

we notice a similarity between the current state-of-the-art for this problem
and a commonly used density-based clustering algorithm, Quickshift. Exploiting
this similarity we propose a number of novel, application specific algorithms
with the goal of producing a general and scalable plant segmentation algorithm.
The novel algorithms proposed in this work are shown to produce quantitatively
better results than the current state-of-the-art while being less sensitive to

incorporated into field-scale phenotyping systems, the proposed algorithms
should work as a drop in replacement that can greatly improve the accuracy of

multitask learning and other problems as a way to decompose problem solving
into multiple reusable computational blocks. We propose a new approach for
learning modular networks based on the isometric version of ResNet with all
residual blocks having the same configuration and the same number of
parameters. This architectural choice allows adding, removing and changing the
order of residual blocks. In our method, the modules can be invoked repeatedly
and allow knowledge transfer to novel tasks by adjusting the order of
computation. This allows soft weight sharing between tasks with only a small
increase in the number of parameters. We show that our method leads to
interpretable self-organization of modules in case of multi-task learning,
transfer learning and domain adaptation while achieving competitive results on
those tasks. From practical perspective, our approach allows to: (a) reuse
existing modules for learning new task by adjusting the computation order, (b)
use it for unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation to illustrate that
adaptation to unseen data can be achieved by only manipulating the order of
pretrained modules, (c) show how our approach can be used to increase accuracy
of existing architectures for image classification tasks such as ImageNet,
without any parameter increase, by reusing the same block multiple times.]]></summary>

several labeled source domains and transfer knowledge to a target domain that
is inaccessible in training. Considering the inherent conditional and label
shifts, we would expect the alignment of $p(x|y)$ and $p(y)$. However, the
widely used domain invariant feature learning (IFL) methods relies on aligning
the marginal concept shift w.r.t. $p(x)$, which rests on an unrealistic
assumption that $p(y)$ is invariant across domains. We thereby propose a novel
variational Bayesian inference framework to enforce the conditional
distribution alignment w.r.t. $p(x|y)$ via the prior distribution matching in a
latent space, which also takes the marginal label shift w.r.t. $p(y)$ into
consideration with the posterior alignment. Extensive experiments on various
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework is robust to the label shift and the
cross-domain accuracy is significantly improved, thereby achieving superior
performance over the conventional IFL counterparts.]]></summary>

improve road safety significantly. However, these benefits do not come without
cost; AVs require large Deep-Learning (DL) models and powerful hardware
platforms to operate reliably in real-time, requiring between several hundred
watts to one kilowatt of power. This power consumption can dramatically reduce
vehicles' driving range and affect emissions. To address this problem, we
propose SAGE: a methodology for selectively offloading the key energy-consuming
modules of DL architectures to the cloud to optimize edge energy usage while
meeting real-time latency constraints. Furthermore, we leverage Head Network
Distillation (HND) to introduce efficient bottlenecks within the DL
architecture in order to minimize the network overhead costs of offloading with
almost no degradation in the model's performance. We evaluate SAGE using an
Nvidia Jetson TX2 and an industry-standard Nvidia Drive PX2 as the AV edge
devices and demonstrate that our offloading strategy is practical for a wide
range of DL models and internet connection bandwidths on 3G, 4G LTE, and WiFi
technologies. Compared to edge-only computation, SAGE reduces energy
consumption by an average of 36.13%, 47.07%, and 55.66% for an AV with one
low-resolution camera, one high-resolution camera, and three high-resolution
cameras, respectively. SAGE also reduces upload data size by up to 98.40%
compared to direct camera offloading.]]></summary>

the neuromotor disorder from speech. Such systems are particularly susceptible
to domain mismatch where the training and testing data come from the source and
target domains respectively, but the two domains may differ in terms of speech
stimuli, disease etiology, etc. It is hard to acquire labelled data in the
target domain, due to high costs of annotating sizeable datasets. This paper
makes a first attempt to formulate cross-domain DSD as an unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) problem. We use labelled source-domain data and unlabelled
target-domain data, and propose a multi-task learning strategy, including
dysarthria presence classification (DPC), domain adversarial training (DAT) and
mutual information minimization (MIM), which aim to learn
dysarthria-discriminative and domain-invariant biomarker embeddings.
Specifically, DPC helps biomarker embeddings capture critical indicators of
dysarthria; DAT forces biomarker embeddings to be indistinguishable in source
and target domains; and MIM further reduces the correlation between biomarker
embeddings and domain-related cues. By treating the UASPEECH and TORGO corpora
respectively as the source and target domains, experiments show that the
incorporation of UDA attains absolute increases of 22.2% and 20.0% respectively
in utterance-level weighted average recall and speaker-level accuracy.]]></summary>

is an important issue due to their capabilities and wide adoption. One way to
understand and improve robustness of these models is an exploration of an
adversarial attack scenario: check if a small perturbation of an input can fool
a model.

Due to the discrete nature of textual data, gradient-based adversarial
methods, widely used in computer vision, are not applicable per~se. The
standard strategy to overcome this issue is to develop token-level
transformations, which do not take the whole sentence into account.

In this paper, we propose a new black-box sentence-level attack. Our method
fine-tunes a pre-trained language model to generate adversarial examples. A
proposed differentiable loss function depends on a substitute classifier score
and an approximate edit distance computed via a deep learning model.

We show that the proposed attack outperforms competitors on a diverse set of
NLP problems for both computed metrics and human evaluation. Moreover, due to
the usage of the fine-tuned language model, the generated adversarial examples
are hard to detect, thus current models are not robust. Hence, it is difficult
to defend from the proposed attack, which is not the case for other attacks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neural text generation models are typically trained by maximizing
log-likelihood with the sequence cross entropy loss, which encourages an exact
token-by-token match between a target sequence with a generated sequence. Such
training objective is sub-optimal when the target sequence not perfect, e.g.,
when the target sequence is corrupted with noises, or when only weak sequence
supervision is available. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
Edit-Invariant Sequence Loss (EISL), which computes the matching loss of a
target n-gram with all n-grams in the generated sequence. EISL draws
inspirations from convolutional networks (ConvNets) which are shift-invariant
to images, hence is robust to the shift of n-grams to tolerate edits in the
target sequences. Moreover, the computation of EISL is essentially a
convolution operation with target n-grams as kernels, which is easy to
implement with existing libraries. To demonstrate the effectiveness of EISL, we
conduct experiments on three tasks: machine translation with noisy target
sequences, unsupervised text style transfer, and non-autoregressive machine
translation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms
cross entropy loss on these three tasks.]]></summary>

various linguistic peculiarities present in the language. The Sanskrit language
is lexically productive, undergoes euphonic assimilation of phones at the word
boundaries and exhibits variations in spelling conventions and in
pronunciations. In this work, we propose the first large scale study of
automatic speech recognition (ASR) in Sanskrit, with an emphasis on the impact
of unit selection in Sanskrit ASR. In this work, we release a 78 hour ASR
dataset for Sanskrit, which faithfully captures several of the linguistic
characteristics expressed by the language. We investigate the role of different
acoustic model and language model units in ASR systems for Sanskrit. We also
propose a new modelling unit, inspired by the syllable level unit selection,
that captures character sequences from one vowel in the word to the next vowel.
We also highlight the importance of choosing graphemic representations for
Sanskrit and show the impact of this choice on word error rates (WER). Finally,
we extend these insights from Sanskrit ASR for building ASR systems in two
other Indic languages, Gujarati and Telugu. For both these languages, our
experimental results show that the use of phonetic based graphemic
representations in ASR results in performance improvements as compared to ASR
systems that use native scripts.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Biomedical word embeddings are usually pre-trained on free text corpora with
neural methods that capture local and global distributional properties. They
are leveraged in downstream tasks using various neural architectures that are
designed to optimize task-specific objectives that might further tune such
embeddings. Since 2018, however, there is a marked shift from these static
embeddings to contextual embeddings motivated by language models (e.g., ELMo,
transformers such as BERT, and ULMFiT). These dynamic embeddings have the added
benefit of being able to distinguish homonyms and acronyms given their context.
However, static embeddings are still relevant in low resource settings (e.g.,
smart devices, IoT elements) and to study lexical semantics from a
computational linguistics perspective. In this paper, we jointly learn word and
concept embeddings by first using the skip-gram method and further fine-tuning
them with correlational information manifesting in co-occurring Medical Subject
Heading (MeSH) concepts in biomedical citations. This fine-tuning is
accomplished with the BERT transformer architecture in the two-sentence input
mode with a classification objective that captures MeSH pair co-occurrence. In
essence, we repurpose a transformer architecture (typically used to generate
dynamic embeddings) to improve static embeddings using concept correlations. We
conduct evaluations of these tuned static embeddings using multiple datasets
for word relatedness developed by previous efforts. Without selectively culling
concepts and terms (as was pursued by previous efforts), we believe we offer
the most exhaustive evaluation of static embeddings to date with clear
performance improvements across the board. We provide our code and embeddings
for public use for downstream applications and research endeavors:

comparison with SDM, a framework specifically designed to integrate events in
sentence meaning representations, and we conducted a detailed error analysis to
investigate which factors affect their behavior. Our results show that TLMs can
reach performances that are comparable to those achieved by SDM. However,
additional analysis consistently suggests that TLMs do not capture important

Professional clinical care practitioners have proposed clinical criterion which
aid in early detection of sepsis; however, performance of these criterion is
often limited. Clinical text provides essential information to estimate the
severity of the sepsis in addition to structured clinical data. In this study,
we explore how clinical text can complement structured data towards early

level without deeper understanding of context. We introduce CONDA, a new
dataset for in-game toxic language detection enabling joint intent
classification and slot filling analysis, which is the core task of Natural
Language Understanding (NLU). The dataset consists of 45K utterances from 12K
conversations from the chat logs of 1.9K completed Dota 2 matches. We propose a
robust dual semantic-level toxicity framework, which handles utterance and
token-level patterns, and rich contextual chatting history. Accompanying the
dataset is a thorough in-game toxicity analysis, which provides comprehensive
understanding of context at utterance, token, and dual levels. Inspired by NLU,
we also apply its metrics to the toxicity detection tasks for assessing
toxicity and game-specific aspects. We evaluate strong NLU models on CONDA,
providing fine-grained results for different intent classes and slot classes.
Furthermore, we examine the coverage of toxicity nature in our dataset by
comparing it with other toxicity datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple tasks and languages,
translation-based cross-lingual transfer is often overlooked in favour of
massively multilingual pre-trained encoders. Arguably, this is due to its main
limitations: 1) translation errors percolating to the classification phase and
2) the insufficient expressiveness of the maximum-likelihood translation. To
remedy this, we propose a new technique that integrates both steps of the
traditional pipeline (translation and classification) into a single model, by
treating the intermediate translations as a latent random variable. As a
result, 1) the neural machine translation system can be fine-tuned with a
variant of Minimum Risk Training where the reward is the accuracy of the
downstream task classifier. Moreover, 2) multiple samples can be drawn to
approximate the expected loss across all possible translations during
inference. We evaluate our novel latent translation-based model on a series of
multilingual NLU tasks, including commonsense reasoning, paraphrase
identification, and natural language inference. We report gains for both
zero-shot and few-shot learning setups, up to 2.7 accuracy points on average,
which are even more prominent for low-resource languages (e.g., Haitian
Creole). Finally, we carry out in-depth analyses comparing different underlying
NMT models and assessing the impact of alternative translations on the
downstream performance.]]></summary>

others, nudging readers or listeners towards different positions on the issue
even without making a biased argument. {Here, we propose FrameAxis, a method
for characterizing documents by identifying the most relevant semantic axes
("microframes") that are overrepresented in the text using word embedding. Our
unsupervised approach can be readily applied to large datasets because it does
not require manual annotations. It can also provide nuanced insights by
considering a rich set of semantic axes. FrameAxis is designed to
quantitatively tease out two important dimensions of how microframes are used
in the text. \textit{Microframe bias} captures how biased the text is on a
certain microframe, and \textit{microframe intensity} shows how actively a
certain microframe is used. Together, they offer a detailed characterization of
the text. We demonstrate that microframes with the highest bias and intensity
well align with sentiment, topic, and partisan spectrum by applying FrameAxis
to multiple datasets from restaurant reviews to political news.} The existing
domain knowledge can be incorporated into FrameAxis {by using custom
microframes and by using FrameAxis as an iterative exploratory analysis
instrument.} Additionally, we propose methods for explaining the results of
FrameAxis at the level of individual words and documents. Our method may
accelerate scalable and sophisticated computational analyses of framing across

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neural chat translation aims to translate bilingual conversational text,
which has a broad application in international exchanges and cooperation.
Despite the impressive performance of sentence-level and context-aware Neural
Machine Translation (NMT), there still remain challenges to translate bilingual
conversational text due to its inherent characteristics such as role
preference, dialogue coherence, and translation consistency. In this paper, we
aim to promote the translation quality of conversational text by modeling the
above properties. Specifically, we design three latent variational modules to
learn the distributions of bilingual conversational characteristics. Through
sampling from these learned distributions, the latent variables, tailored for
role preference, dialogue coherence, and translation consistency, are
incorporated into the NMT model for better translation. We evaluate our
approach on the benchmark dataset BConTrasT (English-German) and a
self-collected bilingual dialogue corpus, named BMELD (English-Chinese).
Extensive experiments show that our approach notably boosts the performance
over strong baselines by a large margin and significantly surpasses some
state-of-the-art context-aware NMT models in terms of BLEU and TER.
Additionally, we make the BMELD dataset publicly available for the research
community.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Language instruction plays an essential role in the natural language grounded
navigation tasks. However, navigators trained with limited human-annotated
instructions may have difficulties in accurately capturing key information from
the complicated instruction at different timesteps, leading to poor navigation
performance. In this paper, we exploit to train a more robust navigator which
is capable of dynamically extracting crucial factors from the long instruction,
by using an adversarial attacking paradigm. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic
Reinforced Instruction Attacker (DR-Attacker), which learns to mislead the
navigator to move to the wrong target by destroying the most instructive
information in instructions at different timesteps. By formulating the
perturbation generation as a Markov Decision Process, DR-Attacker is optimized
by the reinforcement learning algorithm to generate perturbed instructions
sequentially during the navigation, according to a learnable attack score.
Then, the perturbed instructions, which serve as hard samples, are used for
improving the robustness of the navigator with an effective adversarial
training strategy and an auxiliary self-supervised reasoning task. Experimental
results on both Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) and Navigation from Dialog
History (NDH) tasks show the superiority of our proposed method over
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the visualization analysis shows the
effectiveness of the proposed DR-Attacker, which can successfully attack
crucial information in the instructions at different timesteps. Code is

effectively captures the two types of attribute interactions through modeling
and aggregating attribute interactions in a graph matching structure for
recommendation. In our model, the two essential recommendation procedures,
characteristic learning and preference matching, are explicitly conducted

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We describe cases where real recommender systems were modified in the service
of various human values such as diversity, fairness, well-being, time well
spent, and factual accuracy. From this we identify the current practice of
values engineering: the creation of classifiers from human-created data with
value-based labels. This has worked in practice for a variety of issues, but
problems are addressed one at a time, and users and other stakeholders have
seldom been involved. Instead, we look to AI alignment work for approaches that
could learn complex values directly from stakeholders, and identify four major
directions: useful measures of alignment, participatory design and operation,
interactive value learning, and informed deliberative judgments.]]></summary>
