of livelihood. Agriculture work in Bangladesh is mostly done in old ways which
directly affects our economy. In addition, institutions of agriculture are
working with manual data which cannot provide a proper solution for crop
selection and yield prediction. This paper shows the best way of crop selection
and yield prediction in minimum cost and effort. Artificial Neural Network is
considered robust tools for modeling and prediction. This algorithm aims to get
better output and prediction, as well as, support vector machine, Logistic
Regression, and random forest algorithm is also considered in this study for
comparing the accuracy and error rate. Moreover, all of these algorithms used
here are just to see how well they performed for a dataset which is over 0.3
million. We have collected 46 parameters such as maximum and minimum
temperature, average rainfall, humidity, climate, weather, and types of land,
types of chemical fertilizer, types of soil, soil structure, soil composition,
soil moisture, soil consistency, soil reaction and soil texture for applying
into this prediction process. In this paper, we have suggested using the deep
neural network for agricultural crop selection and yield prediction.]]></summary>

Equation (SDE), which brings the state-of-the art performance on image
generation tasks. This paper improves such diffusion models by analyzing the
model at the zero diffusion time. In real datasets, the score function diverges
as the diffusion time ($t$) decreases to zero, and this observation leads an
argument that the score estimation fails at $t=0$ with any neural network
structure. Subsequently, we introduce Unbounded Diffusion Model (UDM) that
resolves the score diverging problem with an easily applicable modification to
any diffusion models. Additionally, we introduce a new SDE that overcomes the
theoretic and practical limitations of Variance Exploding SDE. On top of that,
the introduced Soft Truncation method improves the sample quality by mitigating
the loss scale issue that happens at $t=0$. We further provide a theoretic
result of the proposed method to uncover the behind mechanism of the diffusion

works have shown that graphs could be efficiently laid out through the
optimization of a tailored objective function. In the meantime, Deep Learning
(DL) techniques achieved great performances in many applications. We
demonstrate that it is possible to use DL techniques to learn a graph-to-layout
sequence of operations thanks to a graph-related objective function. In this
paper, we present a novel graph drawing framework called (DNN)^2: Deep Neural
Network for DrawiNg Networks. Our method uses Graph Convolution Networks to
learn a model. Learning is achieved by optimizing a graph topology related loss
function that evaluates (DNN)^2 generated layouts during training. Once
trained, the (DNN)^ model is able to quickly lay any input graph out. We
experiment (DNN)^2 and statistically compare it to optimization-based and
regular graph layout algorithms. The results show that (DNN)^2 performs well
and are encouraging as the Deep Learning approach to Graph Drawing is novel and

obstacles, namely, data sparsity and cold-start problems, which promote the
emergence and development of Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR). The core idea
of CDR is to leverage information collected from other domains to alleviate the
two problems in one domain. Over the last decade, many efforts have been
engaged for cross-domain recommendation. Recently, with the development of deep
learning and neural networks, a large number of methods have emerged. However,
there is a limited number of systematic surveys on CDR, especially regarding
the latest proposed methods as well as the recommendation scenarios and
recommendation tasks they address. In this survey paper, we first proposed a
two-level taxonomy of cross-domain recommendation which classifies different
recommendation scenarios and recommendation tasks. We then introduce and
summarize existing cross-domain recommendation approaches under different
recommendation scenarios in a structured manner. We also organize datasets
commonly used. We conclude this survey by providing several potential research
directions about this field.]]></summary>

spectrum of important applications, from image recognition to autonomous
vehicles. Unfortunately, DNNs are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks
that affect virtually all state-of-the-art models. These attacks make small
imperceptible modifications to inputs that are sufficient to induce the DNNs to
produce the wrong classification.

In this paper we propose a novel, lightweight adversarial correction and/or
detection mechanism for image classifiers that relies on undervolting (running
a chip at a voltage that is slightly below its safe margin). We propose using
controlled undervolting of the chip running the inference process in order to
introduce a limited number of compute errors. We show that these errors disrupt
the adversarial input in a way that can be used either to correct the
classification or detect the input as adversarial. We evaluate the proposed
solution in an FPGA design and through software simulation. We evaluate 10
attacks and show average detection rates of 77% and 90% on two popular DNNs.]]></summary>

downbeat positions, and meter, is critical for many real-time music
applications. Musical rhythm comprises complex hierarchical relationships
across time, rendering its analysis intrinsically challenging and at times
subjective. Furthermore, systems which attempt to estimate rhythmic information
in real-time must be causal and must produce estimates quickly and efficiently.
In this work, we introduce an online system for joint beat, downbeat, and meter
tracking, which utilizes causal convolutional and recurrent layers, followed by
a pair of sequential Monte Carlo particle filters applied during inference. The
proposed system does not need to be primed with a time signature in order to
perform downbeat tracking, and is instead able to estimate meter and adjust the
predictions over time. Additionally, we propose an information gate strategy to
significantly decrease the computational cost of particle filtering during the
inference step, making the system much faster than previous sampling-based
methods. Experiments on the GTZAN dataset, which is unseen during training,
show that the system outperforms various online beat and downbeat tracking
systems and achieves comparable performance to a baseline offline joint method.]]></summary>

same context? What if we explicitly train them to do so? To answer these
questions, we introduce SCAT (Supporting Context for Ambiguous Translations), a

and its continuous mutation, it is of pivotal importance to design a system to
identify different known (and unknown) variants of SARS-CoV-2. Identifying
particular variants helps to understand and model their spread patterns, design
effective mitigation strategies, and prevent future outbreaks. It also plays a
crucial role in studying the efficacy of known vaccines against each variant
and modeling the likelihood of breakthrough infections. It is well known that
the spike protein contains most of the information/variation pertaining to
coronavirus variants.

In this paper, we use spike sequences to classify different variants of the
coronavirus in humans. We show that preserving the order of the amino acids
helps the underlying classifiers to achieve better performance. We also show
that we can train our model to outperform the baseline algorithms using only a
small number of training samples ($1\%$ of the data). Finally, we show the
importance of the different amino acids which play a key role in identifying
variants and how they coincide with those reported by the USA's Centers for

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In applied multivariate statistics, estimating the number of latent
dimensions or the number of clusters is a fundamental and recurring problem.
One common diagnostic is the scree plot, which shows the largest eigenvalues of
the data matrix; the user searches for a "gap" or "elbow" in the decreasing
eigenvalues; unfortunately, these patterns can hide beneath the bias of the
sample eigenvalues. This methodological problem is conceptually difficult
because, in many situations, there is only enough signal to detect a subset of
the $k$ population dimensions/eigenvectors. In this situation, one could argue
that the correct choice of $k$ is the number of detectable dimensions. We
alleviate these problems with cross-validated eigenvalues. Under a large class
of random graph models, without any parametric assumptions, we provide a
p-value for each sample eigenvector. It tests the null hypothesis that this
sample eigenvector is orthogonal to (i.e., uncorrelated with) the true latent
dimensions. This approach naturally adapts to problems where some dimensions
are not statistically detectable. In scenarios where all $k$ dimensions can be
estimated, we prove that our procedure consistently estimates $k$. In
simulations and a data example, the proposed estimator compares favorably to

time-of-flight (ToF) sensors. Our model learns to predict the high-quality
depth and normal maps jointly from ToF raw sensor data. To achieve this, we
meticulously constructed the first large-scale dataset (named ToF-100) with
paired raw ToF data and ground-truth high-resolution depth maps provided by an
industrial depth camera. In addition, we also design a simple but effective
framework for joint depth and normal estimation, applying a robust Chamfer loss
via jittering to improve the performance of our model. Our experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method can efficiently reconstruct
high-resolution depth and normal maps and significantly outperforms

utilization and save training costs for the increasing amount of deep learning
workloads in shared GPU clusters. Existing GPU schedulers largely rely on
static policies to leverage the performance characteristics of deep learning
jobs. However, they can hardly reach optimal efficiency due to the lack of
elasticity. To address the problem, we propose ONES, an ONline Evolutionary
Scheduler for elastic batch size orchestration. ONES automatically manages the
elasticity of each job based on the training batch size, so as to maximize GPU
utilization and improve scheduling efficiency. It determines the batch size for
each job through an online evolutionary search that can continuously optimize
the scheduling decisions. We evaluate the effectiveness of ONES with 64 GPUs on
TACC's Longhorn supercomputers. The results show that ONES can outperform the

three-dimensional (3D) shape. Deep generative models have been adapted to model
their variations typically using a map from a ball-like set of latent
variables. However, previous approaches did not pay much attention to the
topological structure of a point cloud, despite that a continuous map cannot
express the varying numbers of holes and intersections. Moreover, a point cloud
is often composed of multiple subparts, and it is also difficult to express. In
this study, we propose ChartPointFlow, a flow-based generative model with
multiple latent labels for 3D point clouds. Each label is assigned to points in
an unsupervised manner. Then, a map conditioned on a label is assigned to a
continuous subset of a point cloud, similar to a chart of a manifold. This
enables our proposed model to preserve the topological structure with clear
boundaries, whereas previous approaches tend to generate blurry point clouds
and fail to generate holes. The experimental results demonstrate that
ChartPointFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of generation and
reconstruction compared with other point cloud generators. Moreover,
ChartPointFlow divides an object into semantic subparts using charts, and it
demonstrates superior performance in case of unsupervised segmentation.]]></summary>

environments to develop and train robot learning approaches. However, the use
of simulation has skewed the attention to tasks that only require what robotics
simulators can simulate: motion and physical contact. We present iGibson 2.0,
an open-source simulation environment that supports the simulation of a more
diverse set of household tasks through three key innovations. First, iGibson
2.0 supports object states, including temperature, wetness level, cleanliness
level, and toggled and sliced states, necessary to cover a wider range of
tasks. Second, iGibson 2.0 implements a set of predicate logic functions that
map the simulator states to logic states like Cooked or Soaked. Additionally,
given a logic state, iGibson 2.0 can sample valid physical states that satisfy
it. This functionality can generate potentially infinite instances of tasks
with minimal effort from the users. The sampling mechanism allows our scenes to
be more densely populated with small objects in semantically meaningful
locations. Third, iGibson 2.0 includes a virtual reality (VR) interface to
immerse humans in its scenes to collect demonstrations. As a result, we can
collect demonstrations from humans on these new types of tasks, and use them
for imitation learning. We evaluate the new capabilities of iGibson 2.0 to
enable robot learning of novel tasks, in the hope of demonstrating the
potential of this new simulator to support new research in embodied AI. iGibson

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Traumatic brain injury can be caused by various types of head impacts.
However, due to different kinematic characteristics, many brain injury risk
estimation models are not generalizable across the variety of impacts that
humans may sustain. The current definitions of head impact subtypes are based
on impact sources (e.g., football, traffic accident), which may not reflect the
intrinsic kinematic similarities of impacts across the impact sources. To
investigate the potential new definitions of impact subtypes based on
kinematics, 3,161 head impacts from various sources including simulation,
college football, mixed martial arts, and car racing were collected. We applied
the K-means clustering to cluster the impacts on 16 standardized temporal
features from head rotation kinematics. Then, we developed subtype-specific
ridge regression models for cumulative strain damage (using the threshold of
15%), which significantly improved the estimation accuracy compared with the
baseline method which mixed impacts from different sources and developed one
model (R^2 from 0.7 to 0.9). To investigate the effect of kinematic features,
we presented the top three critical features (maximum resultant angular
acceleration, maximum angular acceleration along the z-axis, maximum linear
acceleration along the y-axis) based on regression accuracy and used logistic
regression to find the critical points for each feature that partitioned the
subtypes. This study enables researchers to define head impact subtypes in a
data-driven manner, which leads to more generalizable brain injury risk
estimation.]]></summary>

models over various disparate, remote data sources, without requiring to
transfer any individual data to a centralized location. This results in an
improved generalizability of models and efficient scaling of computation as
more sources and larger datasets are added to the federation. Nevertheless,
recent membership attacks show that private or sensitive personal data can
sometimes be leaked or inferred when model parameters or summary statistics are
shared with a central site, requiring improved security solutions. In this
work, we propose a framework for secure FL using fully-homomorphic encryption
(FHE). Specifically, we use the CKKS construction, an approximate, floating
point compatible scheme that benefits from ciphertext packing and rescaling. In
our evaluation on large-scale brain MRI datasets, we use our proposed secure FL

machines by translating brain activity into control commands.
Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are one of the most used brain signals in
non-invasive BCI applications but are often contaminated with noise. Therefore,
it is possible that meaningful patterns for classifying EEG signals are deeply
hidden. State-of-the-art deep-learning algorithms are successful in learning
hidden, meaningful patterns. However, the quality and the quantity of the
presented inputs is pivotal. Here, we propose a novel feature extraction method
called anchored Short Time Fourier Transform (anchored-STFT), which is an
advanced version of STFT, as it minimizes the trade-off between temporal and
spectral resolution presented by STFT. In addition, we propose a novel
augmentation method, called gradient norm adversarial augmentation (GNAA). GNAA
is not only an augmentation method but is also used to harness adversarial
inputs in EEG data, which not only improves the classification accuracy but
also enhances the robustness of the classifier. In addition, we also propose a
new CNN architecture, namely Skip-Net, for the classification of EEG signals.
The proposed pipeline outperforms all state-of-the-art methods and yields an

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Imitating human demonstrations is a promising approach to endow robots with
various manipulation capabilities. While recent advances have been made in
imitation learning and batch (offline) reinforcement learning, a lack of
open-source human datasets and reproducible learning methods make assessing the
state of the field difficult. In this paper, we conduct an extensive study of
six offline learning algorithms for robot manipulation on five simulated and
three real-world multi-stage manipulation tasks of varying complexity, and with
datasets of varying quality. Our study analyzes the most critical challenges
when learning from offline human data for manipulation. Based on the study, we
derive a series of lessons including the sensitivity to different algorithmic
design choices, the dependence on the quality of the demonstrations, and the
variability based on the stopping criteria due to the different objectives in
training and evaluation. We also highlight opportunities for learning from
human datasets, such as the ability to learn proficient policies on
challenging, multi-stage tasks beyond the scope of current reinforcement
learning methods, and the ability to easily scale to natural, real-world
manipulation scenarios where only raw sensory signals are available. We have
open-sourced our datasets and all algorithm implementations to facilitate
future research and fair comparisons in learning from human demonstration data.

in poor prediction with a high true positive rate (TPR) but a low true negative
rate (TNR) for a majority positive training dataset. Generally, the
pre-processing technique of oversampling of minority class(es) are used to
overcome this deficiency. Our focus is on using the hybridization of Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) and Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique
(SMOTE) to address class imbalanced problems. We propose a novel two-phase
oversampling approach that has the synergy of SMOTE and GAN. The initial data
of minority class(es) generated by SMOTE is further enhanced by GAN that
produces better quality samples. We named it SMOTified-GAN as GAN works on
pre-sampled minority data produced by SMOTE rather than randomly generating the
samples itself. The experimental results prove the sample quality of minority
class(es) has been improved in a variety of tested benchmark datasets. Its
performance is improved by up to 9\% from the next best algorithm tested on
F1-score measurements. Its time complexity is also reasonable which is around
$O(N^2d^2T)$ for a sequential algorithm.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper tackles the data-driven approximation of unknown dynamical systems
using Koopman-operator methods. Given a dictionary of functions, these methods
approximate the projection of the action of the operator on the
finite-dimensional subspace spanned by the dictionary. We propose the Tunable
Symmetric Subspace Decomposition algorithm to refine the dictionary, balancing
its expressiveness and accuracy. Expressiveness corresponds to the ability of
the dictionary to describe the evolution of as many observables as possible and
accuracy corresponds to the ability to correctly predict their evolution. Based
on the observation that Koopman-invariant subspaces give rise to exact
predictions, we reason that prediction accuracy is a function of the degree of
invariance of the subspace generated by the dictionary and provide a
data-driven measure to measure invariance proximity. The proposed algorithm
iteratively prunes the initial functional space to identify a refined
dictionary of functions that satisfies the desired level of accuracy while
retaining as much of the original expressiveness as possible. We provide a full
characterization of the algorithm properties and show that it generalizes both
Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition and Symmetric Subspace Decomposition.
Simulations on planar systems show the effectiveness of the proposed methods in
producing Koopman approximations of tunable accuracy that capture relevant
information about the dynamical system.]]></summary>

unsupervised context is proposed. Low density separators can be used to obtain
a partition of a set of data based on their allocations to the different sides
of the separators. The proposed method is based on applying stochastic gradient
descent to the integrated density on the hyperplane with respect to a
convolution of the underlying distribution and a smoothing kernel. In the case
where the bandwidth of the smoothing kernel is decreased towards zero, the bias
of these updates with respect to the true underlying density tends to zero, and
convergence to a minimiser of the density on the hyperplane can be obtained. A
post-processing of the partition induced by a collection of low-density
hyperplanes yields an efficient and accurate clustering method which is capable
of automatically selecting an appropriate number of clusters. Experiments with
the proposed approach show that it is highly competitive in terms of both speed
and accuracy when compared with relevant benchmarks. Code to implement the

task is carefully designed for learning manipulations on a single category of

must quickly adapt to new tasks given limited training data. Surprisingly,
recent works have outperformed meta-learning methods tailored to FSL by casting
it as standard supervised learning to jointly classify all classes shared
across tasks. However, this approach violates the standard FSL setting by
requiring global labels shared across tasks, which are often unavailable in
practice. In this paper, we show why solving FSL via standard classification is
theoretically advantageous. This motivates us to propose Meta Label Learning
(MeLa), a novel algorithm that infers global labels and obtains robust few-shot
models via standard classification. Empirically, we demonstrate that MeLa
outperforms meta-learning competitors and is comparable to the oracle setting
where ground truth labels are given. We provide extensive ablation studies to

maximum action value using the maximum estimated action value. Algorithms have
been proposed to reduce overestimation bias, but we lack an understanding of
how bias interacts with performance, and the extent to which existing
algorithms mitigate bias. In this paper, we 1) highlight that the effect of
overestimation bias on learning efficiency is environment-dependent; 2) propose
a generalization of Q-learning, called \emph{Maxmin Q-learning}, which provides
a parameter to flexibly control bias; 3) show theoretically that there exists a
parameter choice for Maxmin Q-learning that leads to unbiased estimation with a
lower approximation variance than Q-learning; and 4) prove the convergence of
our algorithm in the tabular case, as well as convergence of several previous
Q-learning variants, using a novel Generalized Q-learning framework. We
empirically verify that our algorithm better controls estimation bias in toy
environments, and that it achieves superior performance on several benchmark
problems.]]></summary>

approximately represented by a low-rank tensor decomposition. This is useful
because complexity can be significantly reduced and the treatment of
large-scale data sets can be facilitated. In this paper, we find a low-rank
representation for a given tensor by solving a Bayesian inference problem. This
is achieved by dividing the overall inference problem into sub-problems where
we sequentially infer the posterior distribution of one tensor decomposition
component at a time. This leads to a probabilistic interpretation of the
well-known iterative algorithm alternating linear scheme (ALS). In this way,
the consideration of measurement noise is enabled, as well as the incorporation
of application-specific prior knowledge and the uncertainty quantification of
the low-rank tensor estimate. To compute the low-rank tensor estimate from the
posterior distributions of the tensor decomposition components, we present an
algorithm that performs the unscented transform in tensor train format.]]></summary>

growth of the number of parameters with respect to the number of channels in
standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Thereby our approach addresses
the redundancy in CNNs that is also exposed by the recent success of
lightweight CNNs. Lightweight CNNs can achieve comparable accuracy to standard
CNNs with fewer parameters; however, the number of weights still scales
quadratically with the CNN's width. Our MGIC architectures replace each CNN
block with an MGIC counterpart that utilizes a hierarchy of nested grouped
convolutions of small group size to address this.

Hence, our proposed architectures scale linearly with respect to the
network's width while retaining full coupling of the channels as in standard
CNNs.

Our extensive experiments on image classification, segmentation, and point
cloud classification show that applying this strategy to different
architectures like ResNet and MobileNetV3 reduces the number of parameters

Q-function) of a Markov decision process (MDP), based on a single trajectory of
Markovian samples induced by a behavior policy. Focusing on a
$\gamma$-discounted MDP with state space $\mathcal{S}$ and action space
$\mathcal{A}$, we demonstrate that the $\ell_{\infty}$-based sample complexity
of classical asynchronous Q-learning --- namely, the number of samples needed
to yield an entrywise $\varepsilon$-accurate estimate of the Q-function --- is
at most on the order of $\frac{1}{\mu_{\min}(1-\gamma)^5\varepsilon^2}+
\frac{t_{mix}}{\mu_{\min}(1-\gamma)}$ up to some logarithmic factor, provided
that a proper constant learning rate is adopted. Here, $t_{mix}$ and
$\mu_{\min}$ denote respectively the mixing time and the minimum state-action
occupancy probability of the sample trajectory. The first term of this bound
matches the sample complexity in the synchronous case with independent samples
drawn from the stationary distribution of the trajectory. The second term
reflects the cost taken for the empirical distribution of the Markovian
trajectory to reach a steady state, which is incurred at the very beginning and
becomes amortized as the algorithm runs. Encouragingly, the above bound
improves upon the state-of-the-art result \cite{qu2020finite} by a factor of at
least $|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|$ for all scenarios, and by a factor of at
least $t_{mix}|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|$ for any sufficiently small accuracy
level $\varepsilon$. Further, we demonstrate that the scaling on the effective
horizon $\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$ can be improved by means of variance reduction.]]></summary>

provide a deep literature review for the applications of RL in I-health
systems. In particular, three main areas have been tackled, i.e., edge

progress in leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, most of them presume a

semi-supervised learning and transfer learning jointly, leading to a more
practical and competitive paradigm that can utilize both powerful pre-trained
models from source domain as well as labeled/unlabeled data in the target

of two complementary components: Adaptive Knowledge Consistency (AKC) on the
examples between the source and target model, and Adaptive Representation
Consistency (ARC) on the target model between labeled and unlabeled examples.
Examples involved in the consistency regularization are adaptively selected
according to their potential contributions to the target task. We conduct
extensive experiments on popular benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CUB-200, and

on a key assumption, i.e., the power system can be accurately modeled. However,
the transmission line parameters are dynamic and cannot be accurately known
during operation and thus the involved modeling errors should not be neglected.
In this paper, an illustrative case has revealed that modeling errors in
transmission lines significantly weaken the detection effectiveness of
conventional FDIA approaches. To tackle this issue, we propose an FDIA
detection mechanism from the perspective of transfer learning. Specifically,
the simulated power system is treated as a source domain, which provides
abundant simulated normal and attack data. The real world's running system
whose transmission line parameters are unknown is taken as a target domain
where sufficient real normal data are collected for tracking the latest system
states online. The designed transfer strategy that aims at making full use of
data in hand is divided into two optimization stages. In the first stage, a
deep neural network (DNN) is built by simultaneously optimizing several
well-designed objective terms with both simulated data and real data, and then
it is fine-tuned via real data in the second stage. Several case studies on the
IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus systems verify the effectiveness of the proposed
mechanism.]]></summary>

environment in a hierarchical manner. We introduce {\em causal curiosity}, a
novel intrinsic reward, and show that it allows our agents to learn optimal
sequences of actions and discover causal factors in the dynamics of the
environment. The learned behavior allows the agents to infer a binary quantized
representation for the ground-truth causal factors in every environment.
Additionally, we find that these experimental behaviors are semantically
meaningful (e.g., our agents learn to lift blocks to categorize them by
weight), and are learnt in a self-supervised manner with approximately 2.5
times less data than conventional supervised planners. We show that these
behaviors can be re-purposed and fine-tuned (e.g., from lifting to pushing or
other downstream tasks). Finally, we show that the knowledge of causal factor
representations aids zero-shot learning for more complex tasks. Visit

aspects of our society, such as well-being, the spreading of epidemics, and the
quality of the environment. When information about mobility flows is not
available for a particular region of interest, we must rely on mathematical
models to generate them. In this work, we propose the Deep Gravity model, an
effective method to generate flow probabilities that exploits many variables
(e.g., land use, road network, transport, food, health facilities) extracted
from voluntary geographic data, and uses deep neural networks to discover
non-linear relationships between those variables and mobility flows. Our
experiments, conducted on mobility flows in England, Italy, and New York State,
show that Deep Gravity has good geographic generalization capability, achieving
a significant increase in performance (especially in densely populated regions
of interest) with respect to the classic gravity model and models that do not
use deep neural networks or geographic data. We also show how flows generated
by Deep Gravity may be explained in terms of the geographic features using
explainable AI techniques.]]></summary>

with self-learning ability for successive modes, where synaptic intelligence is
employed to measure the importance of variables and a regularization term is

on the current model and new data when a new mode arrives, thus delivering
prominent performance for sequential modes. Besides, the computation and

indoor location based services. One of the key challenges in the proliferation
of indoor location based services is the unavailability of indoor spatial maps
due to the complex nature of capturing an indoor space model (e.g., floor plan)
of an existing building. In this paper, we propose a system to automatically
generate floor plans that can recognize rooms from the point-clouds obtained
through smartphones like Google's Tango. In particular, we propose two
approaches - a Recurrent Neural Network based approach using Pointer Network
and a Convolutional Neural Network based approach using Mask-RCNN to identify
rooms (and thereby floor plans) from point-clouds. Experimental results on
different datasets demonstrate approximately 0.80-0.90 Intersection-over-Union

December 2019. It has spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic, imposed

The motivation for predicting every n days (instead of just every day) is the
investigation of the possibility of computational cost reduction and still
achieving reasonable performance. Such a scenario may be encountered real-time
forecasting of time series. Six different deep learning methods are examined on
the data adopted from the WHO website. Three methods are LSTM, Convolutional

edge-level, and graph-level prediction tasks in several domains. Existing
approaches mainly focus on static graphs. However, many graphs change over time
with their edge may disappear, or node or edge attribute may alter from one
time to the other. It is essential to consider such evolution in representation
learning of nodes in time varying graphs. In this paper, we propose a Temporal
Multilayered Position-aware Graph Neural Network (TMP-GNN), a node embedding
approach for dynamic graph that incorporates the interdependence of temporal
relations into embedding computation. We evaluate the performance of TMP-GNN on
two different representations of temporal multilayered graphs. The performance
is assessed against the most popular GNNs on node-level prediction tasks. Then,
we incorporate TMP-GNN into a deep learning framework to estimate missing data
and compare the performance with their corresponding competent GNNs from our
former experiment, and a baseline method. Experimental results on four
real-world datasets yield up to 58% of lower ROC AUC for pairwise node
classification task, and 96% of lower MAE in missing feature estimation,
particularly for graphs with a relatively high number of nodes and lower mean
degree of connectivity.]]></summary>

medical imaging systems. To avoid overly complicating the system by using
different sensors and the adverse effect of the subject's movement, a
learning-based method is proposed to estimate the boundary (external contour)
of the imaged object using the same electromagnetic imaging data. While imaging
techniques may discard the reflection coefficients for being dominant and
uninformative for imaging, these parameters are made use of for boundary
detection. The learned model is verified through independent clinical human
trials by using a head imaging system with a 16-element antenna array that
works across the band 0.7-1.6 GHz. The evaluation demonstrated that the model
achieves average dissimilarity of 0.012 in Hu-moment while detecting head
boundary. The model enables fast scan and image creation while eliminating the

graph-related tasks. Despite the great success, recent studies have shown that
GNNs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where adversaries can
mislead the GNNs' prediction by modifying graphs. On the other hand, the
explanation of GNNs (GNNExplainer) provides a better understanding of a trained
GNN model by generating a small subgraph and features that are most influential
for its prediction. In this paper, we first perform empirical studies to
validate that GNNExplainer can act as an inspection tool and have the potential
to detect the adversarial perturbations for graphs. This finding motivates us
to further initiate a new problem investigation: Whether a graph neural network
and its explanations can be jointly attacked by modifying graphs with malicious
desires? It is challenging to answer this question since the goals of
adversarial attacks and bypassing the GNNExplainer essentially contradict each
other. In this work, we give a confirmative answer to this question by
proposing a novel attack framework (GEAttack), which can attack both a GNN
model and its explanations by simultaneously exploiting their vulnerabilities.
Extensive experiments on two explainers (GNNExplainer and PGExplainer) under
various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method.]]></summary>

for individual nodes of a graph, there has been relatively less success in
extending to the task of graph similarity learning. Recent work on graph
similarity learning has considered either global-level graph-graph interactions
or low-level node-node interactions, however ignoring the rich cross-level
interactions (e.g., between each node of one graph and the other whole graph).
In this paper, we propose a multi-level graph matching network (MGMN) framework
for computing the graph similarity between any pair of graph-structured objects
in an end-to-end fashion. In particular, the proposed MGMN consists of a
node-graph matching network for effectively learning cross-level interactions
between each node of one graph and the other whole graph, and a siamese graph
neural network to learn global-level interactions between two input graphs.
Furthermore, to compensate for the lack of standard benchmark datasets, we have
created and collected a set of datasets for both the graph-graph classification
and graph-graph regression tasks with different sizes in order to evaluate the
effectiveness and robustness of our models. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that MGMN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models
on both the graph-graph classification and graph-graph regression tasks.
Compared with previous work, MGMN also exhibits stronger robustness as the
sizes of the two input graphs increase.]]></summary>

of mobile screens for conveying important contents and functionalities of the

phrase. Summarizing mobile screens requires a holistic understanding of the
multi-modal data of mobile UIs, including text, image, structures as well as UI

Our dataset contains more than 112k language summarization across $\sim$22k

different configurations. Our evaluation of these models with both automatic

physiological signals is an emerging field, and important progress has been
achieved for emotion recognition based on multi-modal signals. However, it is
challenging to make full use of the complementarity among
spatial-spectral-temporal domain features for emotion recognition, as well as
model the heterogeneity and correlation among multi-modal signals. In this
paper, we propose a novel two-stream heterogeneous graph recurrent neural
network, named HetEmotionNet, fusing multi-modal physiological signals for
emotion recognition. Specifically, HetEmotionNet consists of the
spatial-temporal stream and the spatial-spectral stream, which can fuse
spatial-spectral-temporal domain features in a unified framework. Each stream
is composed of the graph transformer network for modeling the heterogeneity,
the graph convolutional network for modeling the correlation, and the gated
recurrent unit for capturing the temporal domain or spectral domain dependency.
Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
model achieves better performance than state-of-the-art baselines.]]></summary>

used in data-driven techniques. In machine condition monitoring, time-series
vibration data are overly used in data mining for deep neural networks.
Typically, vibration data is converted into images for classification using
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and scalograms are the most effective form of
image representation. However, the DNN classifiers require huge labeled
training samples to reach their optimum performance. So, many forms of data
augmentation techniques are applied to the classifiers to compensate for the
lack of training samples. However, the scalograms are graphical representations
where the existing augmentation techniques suffer because they either change
the graphical meaning or have too much noise in the samples that change the
physical meaning. In this study, a data augmentation technique named ensemble
augmentation is proposed to overcome this limitation. This augmentation method
uses the power of white noise added in ensembles to the original samples to
generate real-like samples. After averaging the signal with ensembles, a new
signal is obtained that contains the characteristics of the original signal.
The parameters for the ensemble augmentation are validated using a simulated
signal. The proposed method is evaluated using 10 class bearing vibration data
using three state-of-the-art Transfer Learning (TL) models, namely,
Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, and ResNet50. Augmented samples are generated in
two increments: the first increment generates the same number of fake samples
as the training samples, and in the second increment, the number of samples is
increased gradually. The outputs from the proposed method are compared with no
augmentation, augmentations using deep convolution generative adversarial
network (DCGAN), and several geometric transformation-based augmentations...]]></summary>

server-agent network. In this problem, the system comprises multiple agents,
each having a set of local data points, that are connected to a server. The
goal for the agents is to compute a linear mathematical model that optimally
fits the collective data points held by all the agents, without sharing their
individual local data points. This goal can be achieved, in principle, using
the server-agent variant of the traditional iterative gradient-descent method.
The gradient-descent method converges linearly to a solution, and its rate of
convergence is lower bounded by the conditioning of the agents' collective data
points. If the data points are ill-conditioned, the gradient-descent method may
require a large number of iterations to converge.

We propose an iterative pre-conditioning technique that mitigates the
deleterious effect of the conditioning of data points on the rate of
convergence of the gradient-descent method. We rigorously show that the
resulting pre-conditioned gradient-descent method, with the proposed iterative
pre-conditioning, achieves superlinear convergence when the least-squares
problem has a unique solution. In general, the convergence is linear with
improved rate of convergence in comparison to the traditional gradient-descent
method and the state-of-the-art accelerated gradient-descent methods. We
further illustrate the improved rate of convergence of our proposed algorithm
through experiments on different real-world least-squares problems in both
noise-free and noisy computation environment.]]></summary>

application area in stochastic optimization, reinforcement learning and
operations research. In our model, there are $N$ independent $2$-state Markov
processes that may be observed and accessed for accruing rewards. The
observation is error-prone, i.e., both false alarm and miss detection may
happen. Furthermore, the user can only choose a subset of $M~(M<N)$ processes
to observe at each discrete time. If a process in state~$1$ is correctly
observed, then it will offer some reward. Due to the partial and imperfect
observation model, the system is formulated as a restless multi-armed bandit
problem with an information state space of uncountable cardinality. Restless
bandit problems with finite state spaces are PSPACE-HARD in general. In this
paper, we establish a low-complexity algorithm that achieves a strong
performance for this class of restless bandits. Under certain conditions, we
theoretically prove the existence (indexability) of Whittle index and its
equivalence to our algorithm. When those conditions do not hold, we show by
numerical experiments the near-optimal performance of our algorithm in general.]]></summary>

applications in many domains, ranging from academic research in science and
engineering to industry and business. The modeling power of DNN is believed to
have come from the complexity and over-parameterization of the model, which on
the other hand has been criticized for the lack of interpretation. Although
certainly not true for every application, in some applications, especially in
economics, social science, healthcare industry, and administrative decision
making, scientists or practitioners are resistant to use predictions made by a
black-box system for multiple reasons. One reason is that a major purpose of a
study can be to make discoveries based upon the prediction function, e.g., to
reveal the relationships between measurements. Another reason can be that the
training dataset is not large enough to make researchers feel completely sure
about a purely data-driven result. Being able to examine and interpret the
prediction function will enable researchers to connect the result with existing
knowledge or gain insights about new directions to explore. Although classic
statistical models are much more explainable, their accuracy often falls
considerably below DNN. In this paper, we propose an approach to fill the gap
between relatively simple explainable models and DNN such that we can more
flexibly tune the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy. Our main
idea is a mixture of discriminative models that is trained with the guidance
from a DNN. Although mixtures of discriminative models have been studied
before, our way of generating the mixture is quite different.]]></summary>

disparity with respect to protected attributes, e.g., gender, race, etc., is
important. While quantifying disparity is essential, sometimes the needs of an
occupation may require the use of certain features that are critical in a way
that any disparity that can be explained by them might need to be exempted.
E.g., in hiring a software engineer for a safety-critical application,
coding-skills may be weighed strongly, whereas name, zip code, or reference
letters may be used only to the extent that they do not add disparity. In this
work, we propose an information-theoretic decomposition of the total disparity
(a quantification inspired from counterfactual fairness) into two components: a
non-exempt component which quantifies the part that cannot be accounted for by
the critical features, and an exempt component that quantifies the remaining
disparity. This decomposition allows one to check if the disparity arose purely
due to the critical features (inspired from the business necessity defense of
disparate impact law) and also enables selective removal of the non-exempt
component if desired. We arrive at this decomposition through canonical
examples that lead to a set of desirable properties (axioms) that a measure of
non-exempt disparity should satisfy. Our proposed measure satisfies all of
them. Our quantification bridges ideas of causality, Simpson's paradox, and a
body of work from information theory called Partial Information Decomposition.
We also obtain an impossibility result showing that no observational measure
can satisfy all the desirable properties, leading us to relax our goals and
examine observational measures that satisfy only some of them. We perform case
studies to show how one can audit/train models while reducing non-exempt
disparity.]]></summary>

every round, an adaptive adversary introduces a new game, consisting of an
action space for the learner, an action space for the adversary, and a vector
valued objective function that is convex-concave in every coordinate. The
learner and the adversary then play in this game. The learner's goal is to play
so as to minimize the maximum coordinate of the cumulative vector-valued loss.
The resulting one-shot game is not convex-concave, and so the minimax theorem
does not apply. Nevertheless, we give a simple algorithm that can compete with
the setting in which the adversary must announce their action first, with
optimally diminishing regret.

We demonstrate the power of our simple framework by using it to derive
optimal bounds and algorithms across a variety of domains. This includes no
regret learning: we can recover optimal algorithms and bounds for minimizing
external regret, internal regret, adaptive regret, multigroup regret,
subsequence regret, and a notion of regret in the sleeping experts setting.
Next, we use it to derive a variant of Blackwell's Approachability Theorem,
which we term "Fast Polytope Approachability". Finally, we are able to recover
recently derived algorithms and bounds for online adversarial multicalibration
and related notions (mean-conditioned moment multicalibration, and prediction

provide platforms for empowering freedom of expressions and individual voices,
but also enables people to express anti-social behaviour like online
harassment, cyberbullying, and hate speech. Numerous works have been proposed
to utilize textual data for social and anti-social behaviour analysis, by
predicting the contexts mostly for highly-resourced languages like English.
However, some languages are under-resourced, e.g., South Asian languages like
Bengali, that lack computational resources for accurate natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper, we propose an explainable approach for hate
speech detection from the under-resourced Bengali language, which we called
DeepHateExplainer. Bengali texts are first comprehensively preprocessed, before
classifying them into political, personal, geopolitical, and religious hates
using a neural ensemble method of transformer-based neural architectures (i.e.,
monolingual Bangla BERT-base, multilingual BERT-cased/uncased, and
XLM-RoBERTa). Important(most and least) terms are then identified using
sensitivity analysis and layer-wise relevance propagation(LRP), before
providing human-interpretable explanations. Finally, we compute
comprehensiveness and sufficiency scores to measure the quality of explanations
w.r.t faithfulness. Evaluations against machine learning~(linear and tree-based
models) and neural networks (i.e., CNN, Bi-LSTM, and Conv-LSTM with word
embeddings) baselines yield F1-scores of 78%, 91%, 89%, and 84%, for political,

domains to facilitate the learning in a target domain. It is particularly
useful when the target domain has very few or no labeled data, due to
annotation expense, privacy concerns, etc. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of
TL is not always guaranteed. Negative transfer (NT), i.e., leveraging source
domain data/knowledge undesirably reduces the learning performance in the
target domain, has been a long-standing and challenging problem in TL. Various
approaches have been proposed in the literature to handle it. However, there
does not exist a systematic survey on the formulation of NT, the factors
leading to NT, and the algorithms that mitigate NT. This paper fills this gap,
by first introducing the definition of NT and its factors, then reviewing about
fifty representative approaches for overcoming NT, according to four
categories: secure transfer, domain similarity estimation, distant transfer,
and NT mitigation. NT in related fields, e.g., multi-task learning, lifelong
learning, and adversarial attacks, are also discussed.]]></summary>

paradigm shift in the fifth-generation (5G)networks. 5G networks have
transitioned to software-defined infrastructures, thereby reducing their
dependence on hardware-based network functions. New technologies, like network
function virtualization and software-defined networking, have been incorporated
in the 5G core network (5GCN) architecture to enable this transition. This has
resulted in significant improvements in efficiency, performance, and robustness
of the networks. However, this has also made the core network more vulnerable,
as software systems are generally easier to compromise than hardware systems.
In this article, we present a comprehensive security analysis framework for the
5GCN. The novelty of this approach lies in the creation and analysis of attack
graphs of the software-defined and virtualized 5GCN through machine learning.
This analysis points to 119 novel possible exploits in the 5GCN. We demonstrate
that these possible exploits of 5GCN vulnerabilities generate five novel
attacks on the 5G Authentication and Key Agreement protocol. We combine the
attacks at the network, protocol, and the application layers to generate
complex attack vectors. In a case study, we use these attack vectors to find
four novel security loopholes in WhatsApp running on a 5G network.]]></summary>

the WHO declaring it as a pandemic. In this situation, it is crucial to perform
efficient and fast diagnosis. The reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction
(RTPCR) test is conducted to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2. This test is
time-consuming and instead chest CT (or Chest X-ray) can be used for a fast and
accurate diagnosis. Automated diagnosis is considered to be important as it
reduces human effort and provides accurate and low-cost tests. The
contributions of our research are three-fold. First, it is aimed to analyse the
behaviour and performance of variant vision models ranging from Inception to
NAS networks with the appropriate fine-tuning procedure. Second, the behaviour
of these models is visually analysed by plotting CAMs for individual networks
and determining classification performance with AUCROC curves. Thirdly, stacked
ensembles techniques are imparted to provide higher generalisation on combining
the fine-tuned models, in which six ensemble neural networks are designed by
combining the existing fine-tuned networks. Implying these stacked ensembles
provides a great generalization to the models. The ensemble model designed by
combining all the fine-tuned networks obtained a state-of-the-art accuracy
score of 99.17%. The precision and recall for the COVID-19 class are 99.99% and

natural language tasks and pioneered solutions to software engineering tasks.
Even information retrieval has not been immune to the charm of the transformer,
though their large size and cost is generally a barrier to deployment. While
there has been much work in streamlining, caching, and modifying transformer
architectures for production, here we explore a new direction: distilling a
large pre-trained translation model into a lightweight bi-encoder which can be
efficiently cached and queried. We argue from a probabilistic perspective that
sequence-to-sequence models are a conceptually ideal---albeit highly
impractical---retriever. We derive a new distillation objective, implementing
it as a data augmentation scheme. Using natural language source code search as
a case study for cross-domain search, we demonstrate the validity of this idea
by significantly improving upon the current leader of the CodeSearchNet

understanding of a variety of physical phenomena. Many of these deviate from
Brownian motion, giving rise to anomalous diffusion. Various theoretical models
exists nowadays to describe such processes, but their application to
experimental setups is often challenging, due to the stochastic nature of the
phenomena and the difficulty to harness reliable data. The latter often
consists on short and noisy trajectories, which are hard to characterize with
usual statistical approaches. In recent years, we have witnessed an impressive
effort to bridge theory and experiments by means of supervised machine learning
techniques, with astonishing results. In this work, we explore the use of
unsupervised methods in anomalous diffusion data. We show that the main
diffusion characteristics can be learnt without the need of any labelling of
the data. We use such method to discriminate between anomalous diffusion models
and extract their physical parameters. Moreover, we explore the feasibility of
finding novel types of diffusion, in this case represented by compositions of
existing diffusion models. At last, we showcase the use of the method in
experimental data and demonstrate its advantages for cases where supervised
learning is not applicable.]]></summary>

unstructured data such as text and images but their adoption for
graph-structured data has been limited. This is partly due to the difficulty in
incorporating complex structural information in the basic transformer
framework. We propose a simple yet powerful extension to the transformer -
residual edge channels. The resultant framework, which we call Edge-augmented
Graph Transformer (EGT), can directly accept, process and output structural
information as well as node information. This simple addition allows us to use
global self-attention, the key element of transformers, directly for graphs and
comes with the benefit of long-range interaction among nodes. Moreover, the
edge channels allow the structural information to evolve from layer to layer,
and prediction tasks on edges can be derived directly from these channels. In
addition to that, we introduce positional encodings based on Singular Value
Decomposition which can improve the performance of EGT. Our framework, which
relies on global node feature aggregation, achieves better performance compared
to Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), which rely on local feature aggregation
within a neighborhood. We verify the performance of EGT in a supervised
learning setting on a wide range of experiments on benchmark datasets. Our
findings indicate that convolutional aggregation is not an essential inductive
bias for graphs and global self-attention can serve as a flexible and adaptive
alternative to graph convolution.]]></summary>

scores for key terms before generating the key term feature. We leverage
wideResNet50 to extract and encode the image category semantics to help
semantic alignment of the learned recipe and image embeddings in the joint

by optimizing the batch-hard triplet loss function with soft-margin and double

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper proposes a novel approach to map-based navigation system for
unmanned aircraft. The proposed system attempts label-to-label matching, not
image-to-image matching, between aerial images and a map database. By using
semantic segmentation, the ground objects are labelled and the configuration of
the objects is used to find the corresponding location in the map database. The
use of the deep learning technique as a tool for extracting high-level features
reduces the image-based localization problem to a pattern matching problem.
This paper proposes a pattern matching algorithm which does not require
altitude information or a camera model to estimate the absolute horizontal
position. The feasibility analysis with simulated images shows the proposed
map-based navigation can be realized with the proposed pattern matching
algorithm and it is able to provide positions given the labelled objects.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a type of brain disease which causes visual,
sensory, and motor problems for people with a detrimental effect on the
functioning of the nervous system. In order to diagnose MS, multiple screening
methods have been proposed so far; among them, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
has received considerable attention among physicians. MRI modalities provide
physicians with fundamental information about the structure and function of the
brain, which is crucial for the rapid diagnosis of MS lesions. Diagnosing MS
using MRI is time-consuming, tedious, and prone to manual errors. Hence,
computer aided diagnosis systems (CADS) based on artificial intelligence (AI)
methods have been proposed in recent years for accurate diagnosis of MS using
MRI neuroimaging modalities. In the AI field, automated MS diagnosis is being
conducted using (i) conventional machine learning and (ii) deep learning (DL)
techniques. The conventional machine learning approach is based on feature
extraction and selection by trial and error. In DL, these steps are performed
by the DL model itself. In this paper, a complete review of automated MS
diagnosis methods performed using DL techniques with MRI neuroimaging
modalities are discussed. Also, each work is thoroughly reviewed and discussed.
Finally, the most important challenges and future directions in the automated
MS diagnosis using DL techniques coupled with MRI modalities are presented in
detail.]]></summary>

a significant challenge. To reduce the huge annotation burden, we propose a
Region-based and Diversity-aware Active Learning (ReDAL), a general framework
for many deep learning approaches, aiming to automatically select only
informative and diverse sub-scene regions for label acquisition. Observing that
only a small portion of annotated regions are sufficient for 3D scene
understanding with deep learning, we use softmax entropy, color discontinuity,
and structural complexity to measure the information of sub-scene regions. A
diversity-aware selection algorithm is also developed to avoid redundant
annotations resulting from selecting informative but similar regions in a
querying batch. Extensive experiments show that our method highly outperforms
previous active learning strategies, and we achieve the performance of 90%
fully supervised learning, while less than 15% and 5% annotations are required
on S3DIS and SemanticKITTI datasets, respectively.]]></summary>

containing a person of interest using textual descriptions. However, due to the
significant modality gap and the large intra-class variance in textual
descriptions, text-to-image ReID remains a challenging problem. Accordingly, in
this paper, we propose a Semantically Self-Aligned Network (SSAN) to handle the
above problems. First, we propose a novel method that automatically extracts
semantically aligned part-level features from the two modalities. Second, we
design a multi-view non-local network that captures the relationships between
body parts, thereby establishing better correspondences between body parts and
noun phrases. Third, we introduce a Compound Ranking (CR) loss that makes use
of textual descriptions for other images of the same identity to provide extra
supervision, thereby effectively reducing the intra-class variance in textual
features. Finally, to expedite future research in text-to-image ReID, we build
a new database named ICFG-PEDES. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSAN
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by significant margins. Both the new

necessitates a visual representation that jointly pursues two confounding
goals, i.e., fine-grained discrimination for temporal localization and
sufficient visual invariance for action classification. We address this
challenge by enriching both the local and global contexts in the popular
two-stage temporal localization framework, where action proposals are first
generated followed by action classification and temporal boundary regression.
Our proposed model, dubbed ContextLoc, can be divided into three sub-networks:
L-Net, G-Net and P-Net. L-Net enriches the local context via fine-grained
modeling of snippet-level features, which is formulated as a
query-and-retrieval process. G-Net enriches the global context via higher-level
modeling of the video-level representation. In addition, we introduce a novel
context adaptation module to adapt the global context to different proposals.
P-Net further models the context-aware inter-proposal relations. We explore two
existing models to be the P-Net in our experiments. The efficacy of our
proposed method is validated by experimental results on the THUMOS14 (54.3\% at
tIoU@0.5) and ActivityNet v1.3 (56.01\% at tIoU@0.5) datasets, which
outperforms recent states of the art. Code is available at

introduces more complications to the product retrieval industry. Previous
methods are either subject to single-modal input or perform supervised
image-level product retrieval, thus fail to accommodate real-life scenarios
where enormous weakly annotated multi-modal data are present. In this paper, we
investigate a more realistic setting that aims to perform weakly-supervised
multi-modal instance-level product retrieval among fine-grained product
categories. To promote the study of this challenging task, we contribute
Product1M, one of the largest multi-modal cosmetic datasets for real-world
instance-level retrieval. Notably, Product1M contains over 1 million
image-caption pairs and consists of two sample types, i.e., single-product and
multi-product samples, which encompass a wide variety of cosmetics brands. In
addition to the great diversity, Product1M enjoys several appealing
characteristics including fine-grained categories, complex combinations, and
fuzzy correspondence that well mimic the real-world scenes. Moreover, we
propose a novel model named Cross-modal contrAstive Product Transformer for
instance-level prodUct REtrieval (CAPTURE), that excels in capturing the
potential synergy between multi-modal inputs via a hybrid-stream transformer in
a self-supervised manner.CAPTURE generates discriminative instance features via
masked multi-modal learning as well as cross-modal contrastive pretraining and
it outperforms several SOTA cross-modal baselines. Extensive ablation studies
well demonstrate the effectiveness and the generalization capacity of our

demands of subsequent high-level crowd analysis tasks than simply counting.
However, existing localization based methods relying on intermediate
representations (\textit{i.e.}, density maps or pseudo boxes) serving as
learning targets are counter-intuitive and error-prone. In this paper, we
propose a purely point-based framework for joint crowd counting and individual
localization. For this framework, instead of merely reporting the absolute
counting error at image level, we propose a new metric, called density
Normalized Average Precision (nAP), to provide more comprehensive and more
precise performance evaluation. Moreover, we design an intuitive solution under
this framework, which is called Point to Point Network (P2PNet). P2PNet
discards superfluous steps and directly predicts a set of point proposals to
represent heads in an image, being consistent with the human annotation
results. By thorough analysis, we reveal the key step towards implementing such
a novel idea is to assign optimal learning targets for these proposals.
Therefore, we propose to conduct this crucial association in an one-to-one
matching manner using the Hungarian algorithm. The P2PNet not only
significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods on popular counting
benchmarks, but also achieves promising localization accuracy. The codes will

Axial-Generative Adversarial Network (Axial-GAN) to synthesize high-resolution
visible images for matching. In the proposed approach we augment the GAN
framework with axial-attention layers which leverage the recent advances in
transformers for modelling long-range dependencies. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method by evaluating on two different
thermal-visible face datasets. When compared to related state-of-the-art works,
our results show significant improvements in both image quality and face
verification performance, and are also much more efficient.]]></summary>

We release a development dataset, which contains board-certified radiologist

datasets, we train and test a deep learning model, RadGraph Benchmark, that
achieves a micro F1 of 0.82 and 0.73 on relation extraction on the MIMIC-CXR

tasks. In the literature, high localization accuracy is achieved with the
mainstream strongly supervised frameworks. However, such methods require
object-level annotations and are unable to detect objects of unknown
categories. Weakly supervised methods face similar difficulties. In this paper,
a self-paced learning framework is proposed to achieve accurate object
localization on the rank list returned by instance search. The proposed
framework mines the target instance gradually from the queries and their
corresponding top-ranked search results. Since a common instance is shared
between the query and the images in the rank list, the target visual instance
can be accurately localized even without knowing what the object category is.
In addition to performing localization on instance search, the issue of
few-shot object detection is also addressed under the same framework. Superior
performance over state-of-the-art methods is observed on both tasks.]]></summary>

transforming these diagrams in a way that is compatible with machine learning

contribution consists of three components. First, we develop a general and
unifying framework of vectorizing diagrams that we call the \textit{Persistence

Landscapes, fall under the PC framework. Second, we propose several new

under constrained communication and computation resources. For further
improving communication-efficiency of DFL, compressed communication is applied
to DFL, named DFL with compressed communication (C-DFL). The proposed C-DFL

receive treatment in time and maintain eyesight. Nowadays, deep learning (DL)
based models have been successfully used for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of
glaucoma from retina fundus images. However, a DL model pre-trained using a
dataset from one hospital center may have poor performance on a dataset from
another new hospital center and therefore its applications in the real scene
are limited. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive transfer learning (SATL)
strategy to fill the domain gap between multicenter datasets. Specifically, the
encoder of a DL model that is pre-trained on the source domain is used to
initialize the encoder of a reconstruction model. Then, the reconstruction
model is trained using only unlabeled image data from the target domain, which
makes the encoder in the model adapt itself to extract useful high-level
features both for target domain images encoding and glaucoma classification,
simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SATL
strategy is effective in the domain adaptation task between one private and two
public glaucoma diagnosis datasets, i.e. pri-RFG, REFUGE, and LAG. Moreover,
the proposed strategy is completely independent of the source domain data,
which meets the real scene application and the privacy protection policy.]]></summary>

domains to facilitate the learning in a target domain. It is particularly
useful when the target domain has very few or no labeled data, due to
annotation expense, privacy concerns, etc. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of
TL is not always guaranteed. Negative transfer (NT), i.e., leveraging source
domain data/knowledge undesirably reduces the learning performance in the
target domain, has been a long-standing and challenging problem in TL. Various
approaches have been proposed in the literature to handle it. However, there
does not exist a systematic survey on the formulation of NT, the factors
leading to NT, and the algorithms that mitigate NT. This paper fills this gap,
by first introducing the definition of NT and its factors, then reviewing about
fifty representative approaches for overcoming NT, according to four
categories: secure transfer, domain similarity estimation, distant transfer,
and NT mitigation. NT in related fields, e.g., multi-task learning, lifelong

imperceptible perturbation can trigger dramatic changes in the ranking result.
While previous attempts focus on manipulating absolute ranks of certain
candidates, the possibility of adjusting their relative order remains
under-explored. In this paper, we formulate a new adversarial attack against
deep ranking systems, i.e., the Order Attack, which covertly alters the
relative order among a selected set of candidates according to an
attacker-specified permutation, with limited interference to other unrelated
candidates. Specifically, it is formulated as a triplet-style loss imposing an
inequality chain reflecting the specified permutation. However, direct
optimization of such white-box objective is infeasible in a real-world attack
scenario due to various black-box limitations. To cope with them, we propose a
Short-range Ranking Correlation metric as a surrogate objective for black-box
Order Attack to approximate the white-box method. The Order Attack is evaluated
on the Fashion-MNIST and Stanford-Online-Products datasets under both white-box
and black-box threat models. The black-box attack is also successfully
implemented on a major e-commerce platform. Comprehensive experimental

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[User response prediction, which aims to predict the probability that a user
will provide a predefined positive response in a given context such as clicking
on an ad or purchasing an item, is crucial to many industrial applications such
as online advertising, recommender systems, and search ranking. However, due to
the high dimensionality and super sparsity of the data collected in these
tasks, handcrafting cross features is inevitably time expensive. Prior studies
in predicting user response leveraged the feature interactions by enhancing
feature vectors with products of features to model second-order or high-order
cross features, either explicitly or implicitly. Nevertheless, these existing
methods can be hindered by not learning sufficient cross features due to model
architecture limitations or modeling all high-order feature interactions with
equal weights. This work aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel
architecture Deep Cross Attentional Product Network (DCAP), which keeps cross
network's benefits in modeling high-order feature interactions explicitly at
the vector-wise level. Beyond that, it can differentiate the importance of
different cross features in each network layer inspired by the multi-head

computer vision-based anomaly detection (AD) techniques are gradually deployed

a patch-wise variational inference model coupled with solving the jigsaw puzzle

advanced model architectures, imbalance problems in the training process have
received more attention. It is a common paradigm in object detection frameworks
to perform multi-scale detection. However, each scale is treated equally during
training. In this paper, we carefully study the objective imbalance of
multi-scale detector training. We argue that the loss in each scale level is
neither equally important nor independent. Different from the existing
solutions of setting multi-task weights, we dynamically optimize the loss
weight of each scale level in the training process. Specifically, we propose an
Adaptive Variance Weighting (AVW) to balance multi-scale loss according to the
statistical variance. Then we develop a novel Reinforcement Learning
Optimization (RLO) to decide the weighting scheme probabilistically during
training. The proposed dynamic methods make better utilization of multi-scale
training loss without extra computational complexity and learnable parameters
for backpropagation. Experiments show that our approaches can consistently
boost the performance over various baseline detectors on Pascal VOC and MS COCO

a given image and non-photo-realistically recreating it using neural networks.
While reinforcement learning (RL) based agents can generate a stroke sequence
step by step for this task, it is not easy to train a stable RL agent. On the
other hand, stroke optimization methods search for a set of stroke parameters
iteratively in a large search space; such low efficiency significantly limits
their prevalence and practicality. Different from previous methods, in this
paper, we formulate the task as a set prediction problem and propose a novel
Transformer-based framework, dubbed Paint Transformer, to predict the
parameters of a stroke set with a feed forward network. This way, our model can
generate a set of strokes in parallel and obtain the final painting of size 512
* 512 in near real time. More importantly, since there is no dataset available
for training the Paint Transformer, we devise a self-training pipeline such
that it can be trained without any off-the-shelf dataset while still achieving
excellent generalization capability. Experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves better painting performance than previous ones with cheaper training
and inference costs. Codes and models are available.]]></summary>

applications, enabling learning-based optimization and inverse problems. For
example, photorealistic differentiable rendering pipelines for color images
have been proven highly valuable to applications aiming to map 2D and 3D
domains. However, to the best of our knowledge, no effort has been made so far
towards extending these gradient-based methods to the generation of depth
(2.5D) images, as simulating structured-light depth sensors implies solving
complex light transport and stereo-matching problems. In this paper, we
introduce a novel end-to-end differentiable simulation pipeline for the
generation of realistic 2.5D scans, built on physics-based 3D rendering and
custom block-matching algorithms. Each module can be differentiated w.r.t
sensor and scene parameters; e.g., to automatically tune the simulation for new
devices over some provided scans or to leverage the pipeline as a 3D-to-2.5D
transformer within larger computer-vision applications. Applied to the training
of deep-learning methods for various depth-based recognition tasks
(classification, pose estimation, semantic segmentation), our simulation
greatly improves the performance of the resulting models on real scans, thereby
demonstrating the fidelity and value of its synthetic depth data compared to
previous static simulations and learning-based domain adaptation schemes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Face recognition networks encode information about sensitive attributes while
being trained for identity classification. Such encoding has two major issues:
(a) it makes the face representations susceptible to privacy leakage (b) it
appears to contribute to bias in face recognition. However, existing bias
mitigation approaches generally require end-to-end training and are unable to
achieve high verification accuracy. Therefore, we present a descriptor-based
adversarial de-biasing approach called `Protected Attribute Suppression System
(PASS)'. PASS can be trained on top of descriptors obtained from any previously
trained high-performing network to classify identities and simultaneously
reduce encoding of sensitive attributes. This eliminates the need for
end-to-end training. As a component of PASS, we present a novel discriminator
training strategy that discourages a network from encoding protected attribute
information. We show the efficacy of PASS to reduce gender and skintone
information in descriptors from SOTA face recognition networks like Arcface. As
a result, PASS descriptors outperform existing baselines in reducing gender and
skintone bias on the IJB-C dataset, while maintaining a high verification
accuracy.]]></summary>

of an image and short textual description of how to modify the image. Existing
methods have only been applied to non-complex images within narrow domains,
such as fashion products, thereby limiting the scope of study on in-depth
visual reasoning in rich image and language contexts. To address this issue, we
collect the Compose Image Retrieval on Real-life images (CIRR) dataset, which
consists of over 36,000 pairs of crowd-sourced, open-domain images with
human-generated modifying text. To extend current methods to the open-domain,
we propose CIRPLANT, a transformer based model that leverages rich pre-trained
vision-and-language (V&L) knowledge for modifying visual features conditioned
on natural language. Retrieval is then done by nearest neighbor lookup on the
modified features. We demonstrate that with a relatively simple architecture,
CIRPLANT outperforms existing methods on open-domain images, while matching
state-of-the-art accuracy on the existing narrow datasets, such as fashion.
Together with the release of CIRR, we believe this work will inspire further
research on composed image retrieval.]]></summary>

the purview of Membership Inference Attacks. Through this work, we are the
first to empirically show that the lottery ticket networks are equally
vulnerable to membership inference attacks. A Membership Inference Attack (MIA)
is the process of determining whether a data sample belongs to a training set
of a trained model or not. Membership Inference Attacks could leak critical
information about the training data that can be used for targeted attacks.
Recent deep learning models often have very large memory footprints and a high
computational cost associated with training and drawing inferences. Lottery
Ticket Hypothesis is used to prune the networks to find smaller sub-networks
that at least match the performance of the original model in terms of test
accuracy in a similar number of iterations. We used CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
ImageNet datasets to perform image classification tasks and observe that the

in audio signals. We describe the individual tones via a parametric model,
training a dictionary to capture the relative amplitudes of the harmonics. The
model parameters are predicted via a U-Net, which is a type of deep neural
network. The network is trained without ground truth information, based on the
difference between the model prediction and the individual time frames of the
short-time Fourier transform. Since some of the model parameters do not yield a
useful backpropagation gradient, we model them stochastically and employ the
policy gradient instead. To provide phase information and account for
inaccuracies in the dictionary-based representation, we also let the network
output a direct prediction, which we then use to resynthesize the audio signals
for the individual instruments. Due to the flexibility of the neural network,
inharmonicity can be incorporated seamlessly and no preprocessing of the input
spectra is required. Our algorithm yields high-quality separation results with
particularly low interference on a variety of different audio samples, both
acoustic and synthetic, provided that the sample contains enough data for the
training and that the spectral characteristics of the musical instruments are
sufficiently stable to be approximated by the dictionary.]]></summary>

ResNeXt-101 image encoder with the category embedding using wideResNet-50 with
word2vec. The second tier modality alignment optimizes the textual-visual joint
embedding loss function using a double batch-hard triplet loss with soft-margin
optimization. The third modality alignment incorporates two types of
cross-modality alignments as the auxiliary loss regularizations to further
reduce the alignment errors in the joint learning of the two modality-specific
embedding functions. The category-based cross-modal alignment aims to align the
image category with the recipe category as a loss regularization to the joint
embedding. The cross-modal discriminator-based alignment aims to add the
visual-textual embedding distribution alignment to further regularize the joint
embedding loss. Extensive experiments with the one-million recipes benchmark

capability to review and analyze medical images is gradually deployed. Deep
learning-based region of interest segmentation is among the most exciting use
cases. However, this paradigm is restricted in real-world clinical applications
due to poor robustness and generalization. The issue is more sinister with a
lack of training data. In this paper, we address the challenge from the
representation learning point of view. We investigate that the collapsed
representations, as one of the main reasons which caused poor robustness and
generalization, could be avoided through transfer learning. Therefore, we
propose a novel two-stage framework for robust generalized segmentation. In
particular, an unsupervised Tile-wise AutoEncoder (T-AE) pretraining
architecture is coined to learn meaningful representation for improving the
generalization and robustness of the downstream tasks. Furthermore, the learned
knowledge is transferred to the segmentation benchmark. Coupled with an image

important research challenge because it avoids manual effort for supervised
information collection. In this paper, we propose a view-based deep learning
model called Hierarchical View Predictor (HVP) to learn 3D shape features from
unordered views in an unsupervised manner. To mine highly discriminative
information from unordered views, HVP performs a novel hierarchical view
prediction over a view pair, and aggregates the knowledge learned from the
predictions in all view pairs into a global feature. In a view pair, we pose
hierarchical view prediction as the task of hierarchically predicting a set of
image patches in a current view from its complementary set of patches, and in
addition, completing the current view and its opposite from any one of the two
sets of patches. Hierarchical prediction, in patches to patches, patches to
view and view to view, facilitates HVP to effectively learn the structure of 3D
shapes from the correlation between patches in the same view and the
correlation between a pair of complementary views. In addition, the employed
implicit aggregation over all view pairs enables HVP to learn global features
from unordered views. Our results show that HVP can outperform state-of-the-art
methods under large-scale 3D shape benchmarks in shape classification and
retrieval.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce the task of open-vocabulary visual instance search (OVIS). Given
an arbitrary textual search query, Open-vocabulary Visual Instance Search
(OVIS) aims to return a ranked list of visual instances, i.e., image patches,
that satisfies the search intent from an image database. The term "open
vocabulary" means that there are neither restrictions to the visual instance to
be searched nor restrictions to the word that can be used to compose the
textual search query. We propose to address such a search challenge via
visual-semantic aligned representation learning (ViSA). ViSA leverages massive
image-caption pairs as weak image-level (not instance-level) supervision to
learn a rich cross-modal semantic space where the representations of visual
instances (not images) and those of textual queries are aligned, thus allowing
us to measure the similarities between any visual instance and an arbitrary
textual query. To evaluate the performance of ViSA, we build two datasets named
OVIS40 and OVIS1600 and also introduce a pipeline for error analysis. Through
extensive experiments on the two datasets, we demonstrate ViSA's ability to
search for visual instances in images not available during training given a
wide range of textual queries including those composed of uncommon words.
Experimental results show that ViSA achieves an mAP@50 of 21.9% on OVIS40 under
the most challenging setting and achieves an mAP@6 of 14.9% on OVIS1600

large amount of parameters but constant computation cost, and thus it has
become a trend in model scaling. Still it is a mystery how MoE layers bring
quality gains by leveraging the parameters with sparse activation. In this
work, we investigate several key factors in sparse expert models. We observe
that load imbalance may not be a significant problem affecting model quality,
contrary to the perspectives of recent studies, while the number of sparsely
activated experts $k$ and expert capacity $C$ in top-$k$ routing can
significantly make a difference in this context. Furthermore, we take a step
forward to propose a simple method called expert prototyping that splits
experts into different prototypes and applies $k$ top-$1$ routing. This
strategy improves the model quality but maintains constant computational costs,
and our further exploration on extremely large-scale models reflects that it is
more effective in training larger models. We push the model scale to over $1$
trillion parameters and implement it on solely $480$ NVIDIA V100-32GB GPUs, in

involved multiple semantic meanings, joint reasoning over video and subtitles,

we propose an adaptive hierarchical graph network that achieves in-depth

joint reasoning over video and subtitles in three hierarchies, where the graph
structure is adaptively adjusted according to the semantic structures of the
statement. Secondly, we introduce semantic coherence learning to explicitly
encourage the semantic coherence of the adaptive hierarchical graph network
from three hierarchies. The semantic coherence learning can further improve the
alignment between vision and linguistics, and the coherence across a sequence
of video segments. Experimental results show that our method significantly
outperforms the baseline by a large margin.]]></summary>

Progressive Upsampling and Inpainting Generative Adversarial Network, dubbed
Pro-UIGAN, which exploits facial geometry priors to replenish and upsample (8*)
the occluded and tiny faces (16*16 pixels). Pro-UIGAN iteratively (1) estimates
facial geometry priors for low-resolution (LR) faces and (2) acquires
non-occluded HR face images under the guidance of the estimated priors. Our
multi-stage hallucination network super-resolves and inpaints occluded LR faces
in a coarse-to-fine manner, thus reducing unwanted blurriness and artifacts
significantly. Specifically, we design a novel cross-modal transformer module
for facial priors estimation, in which an input face and its landmark features
are formulated as queries and keys, respectively. Such a design encourages
joint feature learning across the input facial and landmark features, and deep
feature correspondences will be discovered by attention. Thus, facial
appearance features and facial geometry priors are learned in a mutual

visually pleasing HR faces, reaching superior performance in downstream tasks,

better transformer architecture for image recognition. Recently, transformers
without CNN-based backbones are found to achieve impressive performance for

could be sub-optimal when directly used for image recognition. In order to
improve the visual representation ability for transformers, we propose a new
search space and searching algorithm. Specifically, we introduce a locality
module that models the local correlations in images explicitly with fewer

let the search algorithm freely trade off between global and local information
as well as optimizing the low-level design choice in each module. To tackle the
problem caused by huge search space, a hierarchical neural architecture search
method is proposed to search the optimal vision transformer from two levels

objects within a scene. Here, we seek to characterize the computational demands
for abstract visual reasoning. We do this by systematically assessing the
ability of modern deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn to solve
the Synthetic Visual Reasoning Test (SVRT) challenge, a collection of
twenty-three visual reasoning problems. Our analysis leads to a novel taxonomy
of visual reasoning tasks, which can be primarily explained by both the type of
relations (same-different vs. spatial-relation judgments) and the number of
relations used to compose the underlying rules. Prior cognitive neuroscience
work suggests that attention plays a key role in human's visual reasoning
ability. To test this, we extended the CNNs with spatial and feature-based
attention mechanisms. In a second series of experiments, we evaluated the
ability of these attention networks to learn to solve the SVRT challenge and
found the resulting architectures to be much more efficient at solving the
hardest of these visual reasoning tasks. Most importantly, the corresponding
improvements on individual tasks partially explained the taxonomy. Overall,
this work advances our understanding of visual reasoning and yields testable
Neuroscience predictions regarding the need for feature-based vs. spatial
attention in visual reasoning.]]></summary>

academic, industrial and art communities due to its flexibility in enabling
various applications. Existing solutions either attentively fuse deep style
feature into deep content feature without considering feature distributions, or
adaptively normalize deep content feature according to the style such that
their global statistics are matched. Although effective, leaving shallow
feature unexplored and without locally considering feature statistics, they are
prone to unnatural output with unpleasing local distortions. To alleviate this
problem, in this paper, we propose a novel attention and normalization module,
named Adaptive Attention Normalization (AdaAttN), to adaptively perform
attentive normalization on per-point basis. Specifically, spatial attention
score is learnt from both shallow and deep features of content and style
images. Then per-point weighted statistics are calculated by regarding a style
feature point as a distribution of attention-weighted output of all style
feature points. Finally, the content feature is normalized so that they
demonstrate the same local feature statistics as the calculated per-point
weighted style feature statistics. Besides, a novel local feature loss is
derived based on AdaAttN to enhance local visual quality. We also extend
AdaAttN to be ready for video style transfer with slight modifications.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art arbitrary
image/video style transfer. Codes and models are available.]]></summary>

for deep reinforcement learning models with continuous action spaces. Such
real-world applications, however, typically come with critical safety
constraints that must not be violated. In order to ensure safety, we enhance
the well-known multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)
framework by adding a safety layer to the deep policy network. %which
automatically corrects invalid actions. In particular, we extend the idea of
linearizing the single-step transition dynamics, as was done for single-agent
systems in Safe DDPG (Dalal et al., 2018), to multi-agent settings. We
additionally propose to circumvent infeasibility problems in the action
correction step using soft constraints (Kerrigan & Maciejowski, 2000). Results
from the theory of exact penalty functions can be used to guarantee constraint
satisfaction of the soft constraints under mild assumptions. We empirically
find that the soft formulation achieves a dramatic decrease in constraint
violations, making safety available even during the learning procedure.]]></summary>

vehicles (EVs) in the global automotive market. Compared to conventional
internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), EVs can not only help users reduce
monetary costs in their daily commuting, but also can effectively help mitigate
the increasing level of traffic emissions produced in cities. Among many
others, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) exclusively use chemical energy stored
in their battery packs for propulsion. Hence, it becomes important to
understand how much energy can be consumed by such vehicles in various traffic
scenarios towards effective energy management. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel framework in this paper by leveraging the federated learning
approaches for modelling energy consumption for BEVs (Fed-BEV). More
specifically, a group of BEVs involved in the Fed-BEV framework can learn from
each other to jointly enhance their energy consumption model. We present the
design of the proposed system architecture and implementation details in a
co-simulation environment. Finally, comparative studies and simulation results
are discussed to illustrate the efficacy of our proposed framework for accurate
energy modelling of BEVs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, the problem of inaccurate learning targets in crowd counting draws
increasing attention. Inspired by a few pioneering work, we solve this problem
by trying to predict the indices of pre-defined interval bins of counts instead
of the count values themselves. However, an inappropriate interval setting
might make the count error contributions from different intervals extremely
imbalanced, leading to inferior counting performance. Therefore, we propose a
novel count interval partition criterion called Uniform Error Partition (UEP),
which always keeps the expected counting error contributions equal for all
intervals to minimize the prediction risk. Then to mitigate the inevitably
introduced discretization errors in the count quantization process, we propose
another criterion called Mean Count Proxies (MCP). The MCP criterion selects
the best count proxy for each interval to represent its count value during
inference, making the overall expected discretization error of an image nearly
negligible. As far as we are aware, this work is the first to delve into such a
classification task and ends up with a promising solution for count interval
partition. Following the above two theoretically demonstrated criterions, we
propose a simple yet effective model termed Uniform Error Partition Network
(UEPNet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging
datasets. The codes will be available at:

analysis for stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGD with momentum) in
this paper. Differently, for SGD with momentum, we demonstrate it is the two
hyperparameters together, the learning rate and the momentum coefficient, that
play the significant role for the linear rate of convergence in non-convex
optimization. Our analysis is based on the use of a hyperparameters-dependent
stochastic differential equation (hp-dependent SDE) that serves as a continuous
surrogate for SGD with momentum. Similarly, we establish the linear convergence
for the continuous-time formulation of SGD with momentum and obtain an explicit
expression for the optimal linear rate by analyzing the spectrum of the
Kramers-Fokker-Planck operator. By comparison, we demonstrate how the optimal
linear rate of convergence and the final gap for SGD only about the learning
rate varies with the momentum coefficient increasing from zero to one when the
momentum is introduced. Then, we propose a mathematical interpretation why the
SGD with momentum converges faster and more robust about the learning rate than
the standard SGD in practice. Finally, we show the Nesterov momentum under the
existence of noise has no essential difference with the standard momentum.]]></summary>

is a fully convolutional encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder uses visual
features from a network trained for action recognition, and the decoder infers
a saliency map via trilinear interpolation and 3D convolutions, combining
features from multiple hierarchies. The overall architecture of ViNet is
conceptually simple; it is causal and runs in real-time (60 fps). ViNet does
not use audio as input and still outperforms the state-of-the-art audio-visual
saliency prediction models on nine different datasets (three visual-only and
six audio-visual datasets). ViNet also surpasses human performance on the CC,
SIM and AUC metrics for the AVE dataset, and to our knowledge, it is the first
network to do so. We also explore a variation of ViNet architecture by
augmenting audio features into the decoder. To our surprise, upon sufficient
training, the network becomes agnostic to the input audio and provides the same
output irrespective of the input. Interestingly, we also observe similar
behaviour in the previous state-of-the-art models \cite{tsiami2020stavis} for
audio-visual saliency prediction. Our findings contrast with previous works on
deep learning-based audio-visual saliency prediction, suggesting a clear avenue

strategy for visual scene interpretation in the open- world setting. However,
it remains challenging to acquire novel classes in an online fashion for the
segmentation task, mainly due to its continuously-evolving semantic label
space, partial pixelwise ground-truth annotations, and constrained data
availability. To ad- dress this, we propose an incremental learning strategy
that can fast adapt deep segmentation models without catastrophic forgetting,
using a streaming input data with pixel annotations on the novel classes only.
To this end, we develop a uni ed learning strategy based on the
Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, which integrates an iterative
relabeling strategy that lls in the missing labels and a rehearsal-based
incremental learning step that balances the stability-plasticity of the model.
Moreover, our EM algorithm adopts an adaptive sampling method to select
informative train- ing data and a class-balancing training strategy in the
incremental model updates, both improving the e cacy of model learning. We
validate our approach on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets, and the
results demonstrate its superior performance over the existing incremental

that can describe the visual contents of a given video. Existing generative
models like encoder-decoder frameworks cannot explicitly explore the
object-level interactions and frame-level information from complex
spatio-temporal data to generate semantic-rich captions. Our main contribution
is to identify three key problems in a joint framework for future video
summarization tasks. 1) Enhanced Object Proposal: we propose a novel
Conditional Graph that can fuse spatio-temporal information into latent object
proposal. 2) Visual Knowledge: Latent Proposal Aggregation is proposed to
dynamically extract visual words with higher semantic levels. 3) Sentence
Validation: A novel Discriminative Language Validator is proposed to verify
generated captions so that key semantic concepts can be effectively preserved.
Our experiments on two public datasets (MVSD and MSR-VTT) manifest significant
improvements over state-of-the-art approaches on all metrics, especially for
BLEU-4 and CIDEr. Our code is available at

tomography (CT) images is critical for the prediction of the pathological stage
and treatment response of COVID-19. Several deep convolutional neural networks
(DCNNs) have been designed for this task, whose performance, however, tends to
be suppressed by their limited local receptive fields and insufficient global
reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose a pixel-wise sparse graph
reasoning (PSGR) module and insert it into a segmentation network to enhance
the modeling of long-range dependencies for COVID-19 infected region
segmentation in CT images. In the PSGR module, a graph is first constructed by
projecting each pixel on a node based on the features produced by the
segmentation backbone, and then converted into a sparsely-connected graph by
keeping only K strongest connections to each uncertain pixel. The long-range
information reasoning is performed on the sparsely-connected graph to generate
enhanced features. The advantages of this module are two-fold: (1) the
pixel-wise mapping strategy not only avoids imprecise pixel-to-node projections
but also preserves the inherent information of each pixel for global reasoning;
and (2) the sparsely-connected graph construction results in effective
information retrieval and reduction of the noise propagation. The proposed
solution has been evaluated against four widely-used segmentation models on
three public datasets. The results show that the segmentation model equipped
with our PSGR module can effectively segment COVID-19 infected regions in CT
images, outperforming all other competing models.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, the problem of inaccurate learning targets in crowd counting draws
increasing attention. Inspired by a few pioneering work, we solve this problem
by trying to predict the indices of pre-defined interval bins of counts instead
of the count values themselves. However, an inappropriate interval setting
might make the count error contributions from different intervals extremely
imbalanced, leading to inferior counting performance. Therefore, we propose a
novel count interval partition criterion called Uniform Error Partition (UEP),
which always keeps the expected counting error contributions equal for all
intervals to minimize the prediction risk. Then to mitigate the inevitably
introduced discretization errors in the count quantization process, we propose
another criterion called Mean Count Proxies (MCP). The MCP criterion selects
the best count proxy for each interval to represent its count value during
inference, making the overall expected discretization error of an image nearly
negligible. As far as we are aware, this work is the first to delve into such a
classification task and ends up with a promising solution for count interval
partition. Following the above two theoretically demonstrated criterions, we
propose a simple yet effective model termed Uniform Error Partition Network
(UEPNet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging
datasets. The codes will be available at:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Domain adaptation is critical for success when confronting with the lack of
annotations in a new domain. As the huge time consumption of labeling process
on 3D point cloud, domain adaptation for 3D semantic segmentation is of great
expectation. With the rise of multi-modal datasets, large amount of 2D images
are accessible besides 3D point clouds. In light of this, we propose to further
leverage 2D data for 3D domain adaptation by intra and inter domain cross modal
learning. As for intra-domain cross modal learning, most existing works sample
the dense 2D pixel-wise features into the same size with sparse 3D point-wise
features, resulting in the abandon of numerous useful 2D features. To address
this problem, we propose Dynamic sparse-to-dense Cross Modal Learning (DsCML)
to increase the sufficiency of multi-modality information interaction for
domain adaptation. For inter-domain cross modal learning, we further advance
Cross Modal Adversarial Learning (CMAL) on 2D and 3D data which contains
different semantic content aiming to promote high-level modal complementarity.
We evaluate our model under various multi-modality domain adaptation settings
including day-to-night, country-to-country and dataset-to-dataset, brings large
improvements over both uni-modal and multi-modal domain adaptation methods on

single-view-multi-angle consistency (SVMAC) to significantly improve the

3D pose and a camera simultaneously. During training, the estimated 3D pose is
rotated by random angles and the estimated camera projects the rotated 3D poses
back to 2D. The 2D reprojections will be fed into weight-sharing generators to
estimate the corresponding 3D poses and cameras, which are then mixed to impose
SVMAC constraints to self-supervise the training process. The experimental
results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised

understanding, and effective fusion of features with different semantic
representations can significantly improve the model's performance on salient

is designed to effectively expand the receptive fields of features from
different layers and generate features with different receptive fields. MRE can
enhance the semantic representation and improve the model's perception of the
image context, which enables the model to locate the salient object accurately.
Secondly, in order to reduce the reuse of redundant information in the complex
top-down fusion method and weaken the differences between semantic features, a
relatively simple but effective parallel fusion strategy (PFS) is proposed. It
allows multi-scale features to better interact with each other, thus improving
the overall performance of the model. Experimental results on multiple datasets

on long short-term memory (LSTM) with adaptive aggregation, namely AA-RMVSNet.
We firstly introduce an intra-view aggregation module to adaptively extract
image features by using context-aware convolution and multi-scale aggregation,
which efficiently improves the performance on challenging regions, such as thin
objects and large low-textured surfaces. To overcome the difficulty of varying
occlusion in complex scenes, we propose an inter-view cost volume aggregation
module for adaptive pixel-wise view aggregation, which is able to preserve
better-matched pairs among all views. The two proposed adaptive aggregation
modules are lightweight, effective and complementary regarding improving the
accuracy and completeness of 3D reconstruction. Instead of conventional 3D
CNNs, we utilize a hybrid network with recurrent structure for cost volume
regularization, which allows high-resolution reconstruction and finer
hypothetical plane sweep. The proposed network is trained end-to-end and
achieves excellent performance on various datasets. It ranks $1^{st}$ among all
submissions on Tanks and Temples benchmark and achieves competitive results on

to a generative adversarial network to sample from the class space of past

Method: We used a fiber laser-based, label-free, non-consumptive,
high-resolution microscopy method ($<$ 60 sec per 1 $\times$ 1 mm$^\text{2}$),
called stimulated Raman histology (SRH), to image a consecutive, multicenter
cohort of skull base tumor patients. SRH images were then used to train a
convolutional neural network (CNN) model using three representation learning
strategies: cross-entropy, self-supervised contrastive learning, and supervised
contrastive learning. Our trained CNN models were tested on a held-out,
multicenter SRH dataset.

Results: SRH was able to image the diagnostic features of both benign and
malignant skull base tumors. Of the three representation learning strategies,
supervised contrastive learning most effectively learned the distinctive and
diagnostic SRH image features for each of the skull base tumor types. In our
multicenter testing set, cross-entropy achieved an overall diagnostic accuracy
of 91.5%, self-supervised contrastive learning 83.9%, and supervised
contrastive learning 96.6%. Our trained model was able to identify tumor-normal
margins and detect regions of microscopic tumor infiltration in whole-slide SRH
images.

Conclusion: SRH with AI models trained using contrastive representation
learning can provide rapid and accurate intraoperative diagnosis of skull base
tumors.]]></summary>

samples distributed according to the human visual system's retinal sensitivity
that rapidly drops with eccentricity. Recently, the use of Generative
Adversarial Networks was shown to be a promising solution for such a task as
they can successfully hallucinate missing image information. Like for other
supervised learning approaches, also for this one, the definition of the loss
function and training strategy heavily influences the output quality. In this
work, we pose the question of how to efficiently guide the training of foveated
reconstruction techniques such that they are fully aware of the human visual
system's capabilities and limitations, and therefore, reconstruct visually
important image features. Due to the nature of GAN-based solutions, we
concentrate on the human's sensitivity to hallucination for different input
sample densities. We present new psychophysical experiments, a dataset, and a
procedure for training foveated image reconstruction. The strategy provides
flexibility to the generator network by penalizing only perceptually important
deviations in the output. As a result, the method aims to preserve perceived
image statistics rather than natural image statistics. We evaluate our strategy
and compare it to alternative solutions using a newly trained objective metric
and user experiments.]]></summary>

tropical cyclones, threaten the livelihoods and wellbeing of poor and
vulnerable populations. One of the most immediate needs of people affected by a
disaster is finding shelter. While the proliferation of data on disasters is
already helping to save lives, identifying damages in buildings, assessing
shelter needs, and finding appropriate places to establish emergency shelters
or settlements require a wide range of data to be combined rapidly. To address
this gap and make a headway in comprehensive assessments, this paper proposes a
machine learning workflow that aims to fuse and rapidly analyse multimodal
data. This workflow is built around open and online data to ensure scalability
and broad accessibility. Based on a database of 19 characteristics for more
than 200 disasters worldwide, a fusion approach at the decision level was used.
This technique allows the collected multimodal data to share a common semantic
space that facilitates the prediction of individual variables. Each fused
numerical vector was fed into an unsupervised clustering algorithm called
Self-Organizing-Maps (SOM). The trained SOM serves as a predictor for future
cases, allowing predicting consequences such as total deaths, total people
affected, and total damage, and provides specific recommendations for
assessments in the shelter and housing sector. To achieve such prediction, a
satellite image from before the disaster and the geographic and demographic
conditions are shown to the trained model, which achieved a prediction accuracy
of 62 %]]></summary>

unequally both in learning and testing processes. Contemporary studies on DNN
imply that such sample di?erence is rooted on the distribution of intrinsic

discovery on network memorization and generalization, we proposed a pair of
sample regularity measures for both processes with a formulation-consistent
representation. Specifically, cumulative binary training/generalizing loss
(CBTL/CBGL), the cumulative number of correct classi?cations of the
training/testing sample within training stage, is proposed to quantize the
stability in memorization-generalization process; while
forgetting/mal-generalizing events, i.e., the mis-classification of previously
learned or generalized sample, are utilized to represent the uncertainty of
sample regularity with respect to optimization dynamics. Experiments validated
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approaches for mini-batch SGD
optimization. Further applications on training/testing sample selection show
the proposed measures sharing the uni?ed computing procedure could benefit for

sheet and the detection objective PSF. First, we introduce a model of the image
formation process that incorporates this interaction, therefore capturing the
main characteristics of this imaging modality. Then, we formulate a variational
model that accounts for the combination of Poisson and Gaussian noise through a
data fidelity term consisting of the infimal convolution of the single noise
fidelities, first introduced in L. Calatroni et al. "Infimal convolution of
data discrepancies for mixed noise removal", SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences
10.3 (2017), 1196-1233. We establish convergence rates in a Bregman distance
under a source condition for the infimal convolution fidelity and a discrepancy
principle for choosing the value of the regularisation parameter. The inverse
problem is solved by applying the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm
in a novel way. Finally, numerical experiments performed on both simulated and

layers of a generative CNN hold different semantics of the synthesized images.
However, few GAN models have explicit dimensions to control the semantic
attributes represented in a specific layer. This paper proposes EigenGAN which
is able to unsupervisedly mine interpretable and controllable dimensions from
different generator layers. Specifically, EigenGAN embeds one linear subspace
with orthogonal basis into each generator layer. Via generative adversarial
training to learn a target distribution, these layer-wise subspaces
automatically discover a set of "eigen-dimensions" at each layer corresponding
to a set of semantic attributes or interpretable variations. By traversing the
coefficient of a specific eigen-dimension, the generator can produce samples
with continuous changes corresponding to a specific semantic attribute. Taking
the human face for example, EigenGAN can discover controllable dimensions for
high-level concepts such as pose and gender in the subspace of deep layers, as
well as low-level concepts such as hue and color in the subspace of shallow
layers. Moreover, in the linear case, we theoretically prove that our algorithm
derives the principal components as PCA does. Codes can be found in

methods adopts a part-based tracking strategy which divides the target into
equal patches and tracks all these patches in parallel. The target state is
inferred by summarizing the tracking results of these patches. A potential
limitation of such trackers is that not all patches are equally informative for
tracking. Some patches that are not discriminative may have adverse effects. In
this paper, we propose to track the salient local parts of the target that are
discriminative for tracking. In particular, we propose a fine-grained saliency
mining module to capture the local saliencies. Further, we design a
saliency-association modeling module to associate the captured saliencies
together to learn effective correlation representations between the exemplar
and the search image for state estimation. Extensive experiments on five
diverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably
against state-of-the-art trackers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In video understanding, most cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) methods
are tailored for classification tasks, focusing on the discriminative
representation of the trimmed videos. However, action detection requires not
only categorizing actions, but also localizing them in untrimmed videos.
Therefore, transferring knowledge pertaining to temporal relations is critical
for this task which is missing in the previous cross-modal KD frameworks. To
this end, we aim at learning an augmented RGB representation for action
detection, taking advantage of additional modalities at training time through
KD. We propose a KD framework consisting of two levels of distillation. On one
hand, atomic-level distillation encourages the RGB student to learn the
sub-representation of the actions from the teacher in a contrastive manner. On
the other hand, sequence-level distillation encourages the student to learn the
temporal knowledge from the teacher, which consists of transferring the Global
Contextual Relations and the Action Boundary Saliency. The result is an
Augmented-RGB stream that can achieve competitive performance as the two-stream
network while using only RGB at inference time. Extensive experimental analysis
shows that our proposed distillation framework is generic and outperforms other
popular cross-modal distillation methods in action detection task.]]></summary>

but challenging problem. Current solutions leverage various differentiable
renderers to project the generated 3D point clouds onto a 2D image plane, and
train deep neural networks using the per-pixel difference with 2D ground truth
images. However, these solutions are still struggling to fully recover fine
structures of 3D shapes, such as thin tubes or planes. To resolve this issue,
we propose an unsupervised approach for 3D point cloud generation with fine
structures. Specifically, we cast 3D point cloud learning as a 2D projection
matching problem. Rather than using entire 2D silhouette images as a regular
pixel supervision, we introduce structure adaptive sampling to randomly sample
2D points within the silhouettes as an irregular point supervision, which
alleviates the consistency issue of sampling from different view angles. Our
method pushes the neural network to generate a 3D point cloud whose 2D
projections match the irregular point supervision from different view angles.
Our 2D projection matching approach enables the neural network to learn more
accurate structure information than using the per-pixel difference, especially
for fine and thin 3D structures. Our method can recover fine 3D structures from
2D silhouette images at different resolutions, and is robust to different
sampling methods and point number in irregular point supervision. Our method
outperforms others under widely used benchmarks. Our code, data and models are
available at https://github.com/chenchao15/2D\_projection\_matching.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rain removal plays an important role in the restoration of degraded images.
Recently, data-driven methods have achieved remarkable success. However, these
approaches neglect that the appearance of rain is often accompanied by low
light conditions, which will further degrade the image quality. Therefore, it
is very indispensable to jointly remove the rain and enhance the light for
real-world rain image restoration. In this paper, we aim to address this
problem from two aspects. First, we proposed a novel entangled network, namely
EMNet, which can remove the rain and enhance illumination in one go.
Specifically, two encoder-decoder networks interact complementary information
through entanglement structure, and parallel rain removal and illumination
enhancement. Considering that the encoder-decoder structure is unreliable in
preserving spatial details, we employ a detail recovery network to restore the
desired fine texture. Second, we present a new synthetic dataset, namely
DarkRain, to boost the development of rain image restoration algorithms in
practical scenarios. DarkRain not only contains different degrees of rain, but
also considers different lighting conditions, and more realistically simulates
the rainfall in the real world. EMNet is extensively evaluated on the proposed
benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art results. In addition, after a simple
transformation, our method outshines existing methods in both rain removal and
low-light image enhancement. The source code and dataset will be made publicly
available later.]]></summary>

user behavior for internal purposes and for their business customers (e.g.,
advertisers, insurers, security forces, governments, political consulting
firms) who utilize the predictions for personalization, targeting, and other
decision-making. Improving predictive accuracy is therefore extremely valuable.
Data science researchers design algorithms, models, and approaches to improve
prediction. Prediction is also improved with larger and richer data. Beyond
improving algorithms and data, platforms can stealthily achieve better
prediction accuracy by "pushing" users' behaviors towards their predicted
values, using behavior modification techniques, thereby demonstrating more
certain predictions. Such apparent "improved" prediction can unintentionally
result from employing reinforcement learning algorithms that combine prediction
and behavior modification. This strategy is absent from the machine learning
and statistics literature. Investigating its properties requires integrating
causal with predictive notation. To this end, we incorporate Pearl's causal
do(.) operator into the predictive vocabulary. We then decompose the expected
prediction error given behavior modification, and identify the components
impacting predictive power. Our derivation elucidates implications of such
behavior modification to data scientists, platforms, their customers, and the
humans whose behavior is manipulated. Behavior modification can make users'
behavior more predictable and even more homogeneous; yet this apparent
predictability might not generalize when customers use predictions in practice.
Outcomes pushed towards their predictions can be at odds with customers'
intentions, and harmful to manipulated users.]]></summary>

typically addressed by solving optimization problems, which are composed of
data fidelity and prior terms. Recently, several works have considered a
back-projection (BP) based fidelity term as an alternative to the common least
squares (LS), and demonstrated excellent results for popular inverse problems.
These works have also empirically shown that using the BP term, rather than the
LS term, requires fewer iterations of optimization algorithms. In this paper,
we examine the convergence rate of the projected gradient descent (PGD)
algorithm for the BP objective. Our analysis allows to identify an inherent
source for its faster convergence compared to using the LS objective, while
making only mild assumptions. We also analyze the more general proximal
gradient method under a relaxed contraction condition on the proximal mapping
of the prior. This analysis further highlights the advantage of BP when the
linear measurement operator is badly conditioned. Numerical experiments with
both $\ell_1$-norm and GAN-based priors corroborate our theoretical results.]]></summary>

demonstrate that multi-agent coordination can be significantly improved when
communication between agents is allowed. Meanwhile, advances in adversarial
machine learning (ML) have shown that ML and reinforcement learning (RL) models
are vulnerable to a variety of attacks that significantly degrade the
performance of learned behaviours. However, despite the obvious and growing
importance, the combination of adversarial ML and MACRL remains largely
uninvestigated. In this paper, we make the first step towards conducting
message attacks on MACRL methods. In our formulation, one agent in the
cooperating group is taken over by an adversary and can send malicious messages
to disrupt a deployed MACRL-based coordinated strategy during the deployment
phase. We further our study by developing a defence method via message
reconstruction. Finally, we address the resulting arms race, i.e., we consider
the ability of the malicious agent to adapt to the changing and improving
defensive communicative policies of the benign agents. Specifically, we model
the adversarial MACRL problem as a two-player zero-sum game and then utilize
Policy-Space Response Oracle to achieve communication robustness. Empirically,
we demonstrate that MACRL methods are vulnerable to message attacks while our
defence method the game-theoretic framework can effectively improve the
robustness of MACRL.]]></summary>

many-body states by simply "reading" the coefficients, but have to reply on the
previous knowledge such as order parameters and quantum measurements. In this
work, we demonstrate that convolutional neural network (CNN) can learn from the
coefficients of local reduced density matrices to estimate the physical
parameters of the many-body Hamiltonians, such as coupling strengths and
magnetic fields, provided the states as the ground states. We propose QubismNet
that consists of two main parts: the Qubism map that visualizes the ground
states (or the purified reduced density matrices) as images, and a CNN that
maps the images to the target physical parameters. By assuming certain
constraints on the training set for the sake of balance, QubismNet exhibits
impressive powers of learning and generalization on several quantum spin
models. While the training samples are restricted to the states from certain
ranges of the parameters, QubismNet can accurately estimate the parameters of
the states beyond such training regions. For instance, our results show that
QubismNet can estimate the magnetic fields near the critical point by learning
from the states away from the critical vicinity. Our work illuminates a
data-driven way to infer the Hamiltonians that give the designed ground states,

industry to a large amount of research work aiming at the development of
accurate PV power forecasting models. However, most of those models are based
on machine learning algorithms and are considered as black boxes which do not
provide any insight or explanation about their predictions. Therefore, their
direct implementation in environments, where transparency is required, and the
trust associated with their predictions may be questioned. To this end, we
propose a two stage probabilistic forecasting framework able to generate highly
accurate, reliable, and sharp forecasts yet offering full transparency on both
the point forecasts and the prediction intervals (PIs). In the first stage, we
exploit natural gradient boosting (NGBoost) for yielding probabilistic
forecasts while in the second stage, we calculate the Shapley additive
explanation (SHAP) values in order to fully understand why a prediction was
made. To highlight the performance and the applicability of the proposed
framework, real data from two PV parks located in Southern Germany are
employed. Initially, the natural gradient boosting is thoroughly compared with
two state-of-the-art algorithms, namely Gaussian process and lower upper bound
estimation, in a wide range of forecasting metrics. Secondly, a detailed
analysis of the model's complex nonlinear relationships and interaction effects
between the various features is presented. The latter allows us to interpret
the model, identify some learned physical properties, explain individual
predictions, reduce the computational requirements for the training without
jeopardizing the model accuracy, detect possible bugs, and gain trust in the
model. Finally, we conclude that the model was able to develop nonlinear
relationships following human logic and intuition based on learned physical
properties.]]></summary>

learning view and self-supervised learning view, we propose a simple yet

performs supervised learning and self-supervised learning in a cooperative way.
The constraints of intrinsic similarity with the self-supervised module and the
structural similarity with the noisily-supervised module are imposed on a
shared common feature encoder to regularize the network to maximize the

To this end, we generate binarized images of spin configurations of the
$q$-state Potts model ($q\ge 3$) by replacing the spin variables

$q$-state Potts model are entirely different from Ising spin configurations,
particularly at the transition temperature. Moreover, our CNN model is not
trained on the information about whether phases are ordered/disordered but is
naively trained by Ising spin configurations labeled with temperatures at which
they are generated. Nevertheless, the deep CNN can detect the transition point
with high accuracy, regardless of the type of transition. We also find that, in
the high-temperature region, the CNN outputs the temperature based on the
internal energy, whereas, in the low-temperature region, the output depends on
the magnetization and possibly the internal energy as well. However, in the

to tolerate long periods without energy. As the Internet of Things (IoT)
evolves towards a more transient and opportunistic execution paradigm, reducing
energy storage costs will be key for its economic and ecologic viability.
However, decreasing energy storage in harvesting systems introduces reliability
issues. Transducers only produce intermittent energy at low voltage and current
levels, making guaranteed task completion a challenge. Existing ad hoc methods
overcome this by buffering enough energy either for single tasks, incurring
large data-retention overheads, or for one full application cycle, requiring a
large energy buffer. We present Julienning: an automated method for optimizing
the total energy cost of batteryless applications. Using a custom specification
model, developers can describe transient applications as a set of atomically
executed kernels with explicit data dependencies. Our optimization flow can
partition data- and energy-intensive applications into multiple execution
cycles with bounded energy consumption. By leveraging interkernel data
dependencies, these energy-bounded execution cycles minimize the number of
system activations and nonvolatile data transfers, and thus the total energy
overhead. We validate our methodology with two batteryless cameras running
energy-intensive machine learning applications. Results demonstrate that
compared to ad hoc solutions, our method can reduce the required energy storage
by over 94% while only incurring a 0.12% energy overhead.]]></summary>

recent years, yet understanding its limitations and potential for improvement
are lacking. The ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III (GEPIII) Kaggle competition
was the largest building energy meter machine learning competition ever held
with 4,370 participants who submitted 39,403 predictions. The test data set
included two years of hourly electricity, hot water, chilled water, and steam
readings from 2,380 meters in 1,448 buildings at 16 locations. This paper
analyzes the various sources and types of residual model error from an
aggregation of the competition's top 50 solutions. This analysis reveals the
limitations for machine learning using the standard model inputs of historical
meter, weather, and basic building metadata. The types of error are classified
according to the amount of time errors occur in each instance, abrupt versus
gradual behavior, the magnitude of error, and whether the error existed on
single buildings or several buildings at once from a single location. The
results show machine learning models have errors within a range of
acceptability on 79.1% of the test data. Lower magnitude model errors occur in
16.1% of the test data. These discrepancies can likely be addressed through
additional training data sources or innovations in machine learning. Higher
magnitude errors occur in 4.8% of the test data and are unlikely to be
accurately predicted regardless of innovation. There is a diversity of error
behavior depending on the energy meter type (electricity prediction models have
unacceptable error in under 10% of test data, while hot water is over 60%) and
building use type (public service less than 14%, while technology/science is

such behavior we study the problem of combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CMAB)

reward signals for its own interest. This characterization of the adversarial
behavior is a relaxation of previously well-studied settings such as
adversarial attacks and adversarial corruption. We propose a strategic variant
of the combinatorial UCB algorithm, which has a regret of at most $O(m\log T +
m B_{max})$ under strategic manipulations, where $T$ is the time horizon, $m$
is the number of arms, and $B_{max}$ is the maximum budget of an arm. We
provide lower bounds on the budget for arms to incur certain regret of the

constraint under the l_{2} norm is useful for provable adversarial robustness,
interpretable gradients and stable training. While 1-Lipschitz CNNs can be
designed by enforcing a 1-Lipschitz constraint on each layer, training such
networks requires each layer to have an orthogonal Jacobian matrix (for all
inputs) to prevent gradients from vanishing during backpropagation. A layer
with this property is said to be Gradient Norm Preserving (GNP). To construct
expressive GNP activation functions, we first prove that the Jacobian of any
GNP piecewise linear function is only allowed to change via Householder
transformations for the function to be continuous. Building on this result, we
introduce a class of nonlinear GNP activations with learnable Householder
transformations called Householder activations. A householder activation
parameterized by the vector $\mathbf{v}$ outputs $(\mathbf{I} -
2\mathbf{v}\mathbf{v}^{T})\mathbf{z}$ for its input $\mathbf{z}$ if
$\mathbf{v}^{T}\mathbf{z} \leq 0$; otherwise it outputs $\mathbf{z}$. Existing
GNP activations such as $\mathrm{MaxMin}$ can be viewed as special cases of
$\mathrm{HH}$ activations for certain settings of these transformations. Thus,
networks with $\mathrm{HH}$ activations have higher expressive power than those
with $\mathrm{MaxMin}$ activations. Although networks with $\mathrm{HH}$
activations have nontrivial provable robustness against adversarial attacks, we
further boost their robustness by (i) introducing a certificate regularization
and (ii) relaxing orthogonalization of the last layer of the network. Our
experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our regularized networks with
$\mathrm{HH}$ activations lead to significant improvements in both the standard
and provable robust accuracy over the prior works (gain of 3.65\% and 4.46\% on
CIFAR-100 respectively).]]></summary>

are of early exercise type. Often the pricing of early exercise options gives
rise to high-dimensional optimal stopping problems, since the dimension
corresponds to the number of underlying assets. High-dimensional optimal
stopping problems are, however, notoriously difficult to solve due to the
well-known curse of dimensionality. In this work, we propose an algorithm for
solving such problems, which is based on deep learning and computes, in the
context of early exercise option pricing, both approximations of an optimal
exercise strategy and the price of the considered option. The proposed
algorithm can also be applied to optimal stopping problems that arise in other
areas where the underlying stochastic process can be efficiently simulated. We
present numerical results for a large number of example problems, which include
the pricing of many high-dimensional American and Bermudan options, such as
Bermudan max-call options in up to 5000 dimensions. Most of the obtained
results are compared to reference values computed by exploiting the specific
problem design or, where available, to reference values from the literature.
These numerical results suggest that the proposed algorithm is highly effective
in the case of many underlyings, in terms of both accuracy and speed.]]></summary>

adjacent vehicles based on the blockchain empowered SL, then aggregates the
global FDL model among different SL groups with a proposed credibility weights

under instance-targeted poisoning attacks, where the adversary who knows the
test instance may change a fraction of the training set with the goal of
fooling the learner at the test instance. Our first contribution is to
formalize the problem in various settings and to explicitly model subtle
aspects such as the proper or improper nature of the learning, learner's
randomness, and whether (or not) adversary's attack can depend on it. Our main
result shows that when the budget of the adversary scales sublinearly with the
sample complexity, (improper) PAC learnability and certification are
achievable; in contrast, when the adversary's budget grows linearly with the
sample complexity, the adversary can potentially drive up the expected 0-1 loss
to one. We also study distribution-specific PAC learning in the same attack
model and show that proper learning with certification is possible for learning
half spaces under natural distributions. Finally, we empirically study the
robustness of K nearest neighbour, logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron,

materials has applications ranging from topology optimization to multi-scale
structural analysis. However, full-fidelity simulation techniques such as
Finite Element Analysis can be prohibitively computationally expensive when
they are used to explore the massive input parameter space of heterogeneous
materials. Therefore, there has been significant recent interest in machine
learning-based models that, once trained, can predict mechanical behavior at a
fraction of the computational cost. Over the past several years, research in
this area has been focused mainly on predicting single Quantities of Interest
(QoIs). However, there has recently been an increased interest in a more
challenging problem: predicting full-field QoI (e.g., displacement/strain
fields, damage fields) for mechanical problems. Due to the added complexity of
full-field information, network architectures that perform well on single QoI
problems may perform poorly in the full-field QoI problem setting. The work
presented in this paper is twofold. First, we made a significant extension to
the Mechanical MNIST dataset designed to enable the investigation of full field
QoI prediction. Specifically, we added Finite Element simulation results of
quasi-static brittle fracture in a heterogeneous material captured with the
phase-field method. Second, we established strong baseline performance for
predicting full-field QoI with MultiRes-WNet architecture. In addition to
presenting the results in this paper, we have released our model implementation
and the Mechanical MNIST Crack Path dataset under open-source licenses. We
anticipate that future researchers will directly use our model architecture on
related datasets and potentially design models that exceed the baseline
performance for predicting full-field QoI established in this paper.]]></summary>

and PDE discoveries in computational physics. One caveat of current methods
however is the need for large amounts of (clean) data in order to recover full
system responses or underlying physical models. Bayesian methods may be
particularly promising to overcome these challenges as they are naturally less
sensitive to sparse and noisy data. In this paper, we propose to use Bayesian
neural networks (BNN) in order to: 1) Recover the full system states from
measurement data (e.g. temperature, velocity field, etc.). We use Hamiltonian
Monte-Carlo to sample the posterior distribution of a deep and dense BNN, and
show that it is possible to accurately capture physics of varying complexity
without overfitting. 2) Recover the parameters in the underlying partial
differential equation (PDE) governing the physical system. Using the trained
BNN as a surrogate of the system response, we generate datasets of derivatives
potentially comprising the latent PDE of the observed system and perform a
Bayesian linear regression (BLR) between the successive derivatives in space
and time to recover the original PDE parameters. We take advantage of the
confidence intervals on the BNN outputs and introduce the spatial derivative
variance into the BLR likelihood to discard the influence of highly uncertain
surrogate data points, which allows for more accurate parameter discovery. We
demonstrate our approach on a handful of example applied to physics and
non-linear dynamics.]]></summary>

Convex Optimization (DP-SCO) and provide excess population risks for some
special classes of functions that are faster than the previous results of
general convex and strongly convex functions. In the first part of the paper,
we study the case where the population risk function satisfies the Tysbakov
Noise Condition (TNC) with some parameter $\theta>1$. Specifically, we first
show that under some mild assumptions on the loss functions, there is an
algorithm whose output could achieve an upper bound of
$\tilde{O}((\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+\frac{\sqrt{d\log
\frac{1}{\delta}}}{n\epsilon})^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1})$ for $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-DP when $\theta\geq 2$, here $n$ is the sample size and $d$ is the
dimension of the space. Then we address the inefficiency issue, improve the
upper bounds by $\text{Poly}(\log n)$ factors and extend to the case where
$\theta\geq \bar{\theta}>1$ for some known $\bar{\theta}$. Next we show that
the excess population risk of population functions satisfying TNC with
parameter $\theta>1$ is always lower bounded by
$\Omega((\frac{d}{n\epsilon})^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}) $ and
$\Omega((\frac{\sqrt{d\log

$(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP, respectively. In the second part, we focus on a
special case where the population risk function is strongly convex. Unlike the
previous studies, here we assume the loss function is {\em non-negative} and
{\em the optimal value of population risk is sufficiently small}. With these
additional assumptions, we propose a new method whose output could achieve an
upper bound of
$O(\frac{d\log\frac{1}{\delta}}{n^2\epsilon^2}+\frac{1}{n^{\tau}})$ for any

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Incremental learning of semantic segmentation has emerged as a promising
strategy for visual scene interpretation in the open- world setting. However,
it remains challenging to acquire novel classes in an online fashion for the
segmentation task, mainly due to its continuously-evolving semantic label
space, partial pixelwise ground-truth annotations, and constrained data
availability. To ad- dress this, we propose an incremental learning strategy
that can fast adapt deep segmentation models without catastrophic forgetting,
using a streaming input data with pixel annotations on the novel classes only.
To this end, we develop a uni ed learning strategy based on the
Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, which integrates an iterative
relabeling strategy that lls in the missing labels and a rehearsal-based
incremental learning step that balances the stability-plasticity of the model.
Moreover, our EM algorithm adopts an adaptive sampling method to select
informative train- ing data and a class-balancing training strategy in the
incremental model updates, both improving the e cacy of model learning. We
validate our approach on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets, and the
results demonstrate its superior performance over the existing incremental
methods.]]></summary>

to outperform autoregressive models in perceptual quality with much higher
generation speed. However, autoregressive vocoders are still the common choice
for neural generation of speech signals coded at very low bit rates. In this
paper, we present a GAN vocoder which is able to generate wideband speech
waveforms from parameters coded at 1.6 kbit/s. The proposed model is a modified
version of the StyleMelGAN vocoder that can run in frame-by-frame manner,
making it suitable for streaming applications. The experimental results show
that the proposed model significantly outperforms prior autoregressive vocoders
like LPCNet for very low bit rate speech coding, with computational complexity
of about 5 GMACs, providing a new state of the art in this domain. Moreover,
this streamwise adversarial vocoder delivers quality competitive to advanced
speech codecs such as EVS at 5.9 kbit/s on clean speech, which motivates
further usage of feed-forward fully-convolutional models for low bit rate
speech coding.]]></summary>

manifold number of applications. However, they often suffer from high
computational requirements impairing their efficient use in real-time systems,
even when employing dedicated hardware accelerators. Ensemble learning methods
are especially suitable for hardware acceleration since they can be constructed
from individual learners of low complexity and thus offer large parallelization
potential. For classification, the outputs of these learners are typically
combined by majority voting, which often represents the bottleneck of a
hardware accelerator for ensemble inference. In this work, we present a novel
architecture that allows obtaining a majority decision in a number of clock
cycles that is logarithmic in the number of inputs. We show, that for the
example application of handwritten digit recognition a random forest processing
engine employing this majority decision architecture implemented on an FPGA
allows the classification of more than seven million images per second.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the current deep learning based recommendation system, the embedding
method is generally employed to complete the conversion from the
high-dimensional sparse feature vector to the low-dimensional dense feature
vector. However, as the dimension of the input vector of the embedding layer is
too large, the addition of the embedding layer significantly slows down the
convergence speed of the entire neural network, which is not acceptable in
real-world scenarios. In addition, as the interaction between users and items
increases and the relationship between items becomes more complicated, the
embedding method proposed for sequence data is no longer suitable for graphic
data in the current real environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the
Dual-modal Graph Embedding Method (DGEM) to solve these problems. DGEM includes
two modes, static and dynamic. We first construct the item graph to extract the
graph structure and use random walk of unequal probability to capture the
high-order proximity between the items. Then we generate the graph embedding
vector through the Skip-Gram model, and finally feed the downstream deep neural
network for the recommendation task. The experimental results show that DGEM
can mine the high-order proximity between items and enhance the expression
ability of the recommendation model. Meanwhile it also improves the
recommendation performance by utilizing the time dependent relationship between
items.]]></summary>

low-dimensional projections of the HIN nodes that preserve the HIN structure

approach to preserve the information in the pairwise relations in a
cluster-aware manner. In addition, we deploy contrastive modules to
simultaneously utilize the information in multiple meta-paths, thereby
alleviating the meta-path selection problem - a challenge faced by many of the
famous HIN embedding approaches. The HIN embedding, thus learned, not only
improves the clustering performance but also preserves pairwise proximity as

(CBTL/CBGL), the cumulative number of correct classi?cations of the
training/testing sample within training stage, is proposed to quantize the
stability in memorization-generalization process; while
forgetting/mal-generalizing events, i.e., the mis-classification of previously
learned or generalized sample, are utilized to represent the uncertainty of
sample regularity with respect to optimization dynamics. Experiments validated
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approaches for mini-batch SGD
optimization. Further applications on training/testing sample selection show

applications are canonical challenges in Computer Science. The difficulty of
finding quality labels for problem instances holds back leveraging supervised
learning across combinatorial problems. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
have recently been adopted to solve this challenge automatically. The
underlying principle of this approach is to deploy a graph neural network (GNN)
for encoding both the local information of the nodes and the graph-structured
data in order to capture the current state of the environment. Then, it is
followed by the actor to learn the problem-specific heuristics on its own and
make an informed decision at each state for finally reaching a good solution.
Recent studies on this subject mainly focus on a family of combinatorial
problems on the graph, such as the travel salesman problem, where the proposed
model aims to find an ordering of vertices that optimizes a given objective
function. We use the security-aware phone clone allocation in the cloud as a
classical quadratic assignment problem (QAP) to investigate whether or not deep
RL-based model is generally applicable to solve other classes of such hard
problems. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that existing RL-based model may

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The advances in deep neural networks (DNN) have significantly enhanced
real-time detection of anomalous data in IoT applications. However, the
complexity-accuracy-delay dilemma persists: complex DNN models offer higher
accuracy, but typical IoT devices can barely afford the computation load, and
the remedy of offloading the load to the cloud incurs long delay. In this
paper, we address this challenge by proposing an adaptive anomaly detection
scheme with hierarchical edge computing (HEC). Specifically, we first construct
multiple anomaly detection DNN models with increasing complexity, and associate
each of them to a corresponding HEC layer. Then, we design an adaptive model
selection scheme that is formulated as a contextual-bandit problem and solved
by using a reinforcement learning policy network. We also incorporate a
parallelism policy training method to accelerate the training process by taking
advantage of distributed models. We build an HEC testbed using real IoT
devices, implement and evaluate our contextual-bandit approach with both
univariate and multivariate IoT datasets. In comparison with both baseline and
state-of-the-art schemes, our adaptive approach strikes the best accuracy-delay
tradeoff on the univariate dataset, and achieves the best accuracy and F1-score
on the multivariate dataset with only negligibly longer delay than the best
(but inflexible) scheme.]]></summary>

descent (DPSGD) is a fundamental challenge. Unlike the typical SGD, private
datasets cannot be used many times for hyperparameter search in DPSGD; e.g.,
via a grid search. Therefore, there is an essential need for algorithms that,
within a given search space, can find near-optimal hyperparameters for the best
achievable privacy-utility tradeoffs efficiently. We formulate this problem
into a general optimization framework for establishing a desirable
privacy-utility tradeoff, and systematically study three cost-effective
algorithms for being used in the proposed framework: evolutionary, Bayesian,
and reinforcement learning. Our experiments, for hyperparameter tuning in DPSGD
conducted on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, show that these three algorithms
significantly outperform the widely used grid search baseline. As this paper
offers a first-of-a-kind framework for hyperparameter tuning in DPSGD, we
discuss existing challenges and open directions for future studies. As we
believe our work has implications to be utilized in the pipeline of private
deep learning, we open-source our code at

matrices such as partial Gaussian circulant matrices is of significant
practical importance due to their faster matrix operations. In this paper, we
provide recovery guarantees for a correlation-based optimization algorithm for
robust 1-bit compressive sensing with randomly signed partial Gaussian
circulant matrices and generative models. Under suitable assumptions, we match
guarantees that were previously only known to hold for i.i.d.~Gaussian matrices

ubiquitous computing. Because of the trend of deploying AI on IoT devices or
smartphones, more researchers are designing different HAR models for embedded
devices. Deployment of models in embedded devices can help enhance the
efficiency of HAR. We propose a multi-level HAR modeling pipeline called
Stage-Logits-Memory Distillation (SMLDist) for constructing deep convolutional
HAR models with embedded hardware support. SMLDist includes stage distillation,
memory distillation, and logits distillation. Stage distillation constrains the
learning direction of the intermediate features. The teacher model teaches the
student models how to explain and store the inner relationship among
high-dimensional features based on Hopfield networks in memory distillation.
Logits distillation builds logits distilled by a smoothed conditional rule to
preserve the probability distribution and enhance the softer target accuracy.
We compare the accuracy, F1 macro score, and energy cost on embedded platforms
of a MobileNet V3 model built by our SMLDist with those of various
state-of-the-art HAR frameworks. The product model has a good balance with
robustness and efficiency. SMLDist can also compress models with a minor
performance loss at an equal compression ratio to other advanced knowledge

problems that use large graph models. Challenges for a GNN hardware platform
include the ability to (a) host a variety of GNNs, (b) handle high sparsity in
input vertex feature vectors and the graph adjacency matrix and the
accompanying random memory access patterns, and (c) maintain load-balanced
computation in the face of uneven workloads, induced by high sparsity and
power-law vertex degree distributions. This paper proposes GNNIE, an
accelerator designed to run a broad range of GNNs. It tackles workload
imbalance by (i)~splitting vertex feature operands into blocks, (ii)~reordering
and redistributing computations, (iii)~using a novel flexible MAC architecture.
It adopts a graph-specific, degree-aware caching policy that is well suited to
real-world graph characteristics. The policy enhances on-chip data reuse and
avoids random memory access to DRAM.

GNNIE achieves average speedups of 21233x over a CPU and 699x over a GPU over
multiple datasets on graph attention networks (GATs), graph convolutional
networks (GCNs), GraphSAGE, GINConv, and DiffPool. Compared to prior
approaches, GNNIE achieves an average speedup of 35x over HyGCN (which cannot
implement GATs) for GCN, GraphSAGE, and GINConv, and, using 3.4x fewer
processing units, an average speedup of 2.1x over AWB-GCN (which runs only
GCNs).]]></summary>

differentiable log densities. Starting from a random initialization, Pathfinder
locates normal approximations to the target density along a quasi-Newton
optimization path, with local covariance estimated using the inverse Hessian
estimates produced by the optimizer. Pathfinder returns draws from the
approximation with the lowest estimated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to the
true posterior. We evaluate Pathfinder on a wide range of posterior
distributions, demonstrating that its approximate draws are better than those
from automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI) and comparable to
those produced by short chains of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), as
measured by 1-Wasserstein distance. Compared to ADVI and short dynamic HMC
runs, Pathfinder requires one to two orders of magnitude fewer log density and
gradient evaluations, with greater reductions for more challenging posteriors.
Importance resampling over multiple runs of Pathfinder improves the diversity
of approximate draws, reducing 1-Wasserstein distance further and providing a
measure of robustness to optimization failures on plateaus, saddle points, or
in minor modes. The Monte Carlo KL-divergence estimates are embarrassingly
parallelizable in the core Pathfinder algorithm, as are multiple runs in the
resampling version, further increasing Pathfinder's speed advantage with

numerous applications in wireless networks. However, the conventional ML
approaches have been facing many challenges in practical implementation, such
as the lack of labeled data, the constantly changing wireless environments, the
long training process, and the limited capacity of wireless devices. These
challenges, if not addressed, will impede the effectiveness and applicability
of ML in future wireless networks. To address these problems, Transfer Learning
(TL) has recently emerged to be a very promising solution. The core idea of TL
is to leverage and synthesize distilled knowledge from similar tasks as well as
from valuable experiences accumulated from the past to facilitate the learning
of new problems. Doing so, TL techniques can reduce the dependence on labeled
data, improve the learning speed, and enhance the ML methods' robustness to
different wireless environments. This article aims to provide a comprehensive
survey on applications of TL in wireless networks. Particularly, we first
provide an overview of TL including formal definitions, classification, and
various types of TL techniques. We then discuss diverse TL approaches proposed
to address emerging issues in wireless networks. The issues include spectrum

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As one of the most fundamental problems in machine learning, statistics and
differential privacy, Differentially Private Stochastic Convex Optimization
(DP-SCO) has been extensively studied in recent years. However, most of the
previous work can only handle either regular data distribution or irregular
data in the low dimensional space case. To better understand the challenges
arising from irregular data distribution, in this paper we provide the first
study on the problem of DP-SCO with heavy-tailed data in the high dimensional
space. In the first part we focus on the problem over some polytope constraint
(such as the $\ell_1$-norm ball). We show that if the loss function is smooth
and its gradient has bounded second order moment, it is possible to get a (high
probability) error bound (excess population risk) of $\tilde{O}(\frac{\log
d}{(n\epsilon)^\frac{1}{3}})$ in the $\epsilon$-DP model, where $n$ is the
sample size and $d$ is the dimensionality of the underlying space. Next, for
LASSO, if the data distribution that has bounded fourth-order moments, we
improve the bound to $\tilde{O}(\frac{\log d}{(n\epsilon)^\frac{2}{5}})$ in the
$(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP model. In the second part of the paper, we study sparse
learning with heavy-tailed data. We first revisit the sparse linear model and
propose a truncated DP-IHT method whose output could achieve an error of
$\tilde{O}(\frac{s^{*2}\log d}{n\epsilon})$, where $s^*$ is the sparsity of the
underlying parameter. Then we study a more general problem over the sparsity
({\em i.e.,} $\ell_0$-norm) constraint, and show that it is possible to achieve
an error of $\tilde{O}(\frac{s^{*\frac{3}{2}}\log d}{n\epsilon})$, which is
also near optimal up to a factor of $\tilde{O}{(\sqrt{s^*})}$, if the loss
function is smooth and strongly convex.]]></summary>

nonlinearity; the choice of the function has great impact on the success of
training. Currently, many practitioners prefer the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
due to its simplicity and reliability, despite its few drawbacks. While most
previous functions proposed to supplant ReLU have been hand-designed, recent
work on learning the function during training has shown promising results. In
this paper we propose an adaptive piecewise linear activation function, the
Piecewise Linear Unit (PiLU), which can be learned independently for each
dimension of the neural network. We demonstrate how PiLU is a generalised
rectifier unit and note its similarities with the Adaptive Piecewise Linear
Units, namely adaptive and piecewise linear. Across a distribution of 30
experiments, we show that for the same model architecture, hyperparameters, and
pre-processing, PiLU significantly outperforms ReLU: reducing classification
error by 18.53% on CIFAR-10 and 13.13% on CIFAR-100, for a minor increase in
the number of neurons. Further work should be dedicated to exploring
generalised piecewise linear units, as well as verifying these results across
other challenging domains and larger problems.]]></summary>

of novel deep learning methods, learned MVS has surpassed the accuracy of
classical approaches, but still relies on building a memory intensive dense
cost volume. Novel View Synthesis (NVS) is a parallel line of research and has
recently seen an increase in popularity with Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)
models, which optimize a per scene radiance field. However, NeRF methods do not
generalize to novel scenes and are slow to train and test. We propose to bridge
the gap between these two methodologies with a novel network that can recover
3D scene geometry as a distance function, together with high-resolution color
images. Our method uses only a sparse set of images as input and can generalize
well to novel scenes. Additionally, we propose a coarse-to-fine sphere tracing
approach in order to significantly increase speed. We show on various datasets
that our method reaches comparable accuracy to per-scene optimized methods
while being able to generalize and running significantly faster.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we introduce a novel task, referred to as Weakly-Supervised
Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection (WSSTAD) in surveillance video. Specifically,
given an untrimmed video, WSSTAD aims to localize a spatio-temporal tube (i.e.,
a sequence of bounding boxes at consecutive times) that encloses the abnormal
event, with only coarse video-level annotations as supervision during training.
To address this challenging task, we propose a dual-branch network which takes
as input the proposals with multi-granularities in both spatial-temporal
domains. Each branch employs a relationship reasoning module to capture the
correlation between tubes/videolets, which can provide rich contextual
information and complex entity relationships for the concept learning of
abnormal behaviors. Mutually-guided Progressive Refinement framework is set up
to employ dual-path mutual guidance in a recurrent manner, iteratively sharing
auxiliary supervision information across branches. It impels the learned
concepts of each branch to serve as a guide for its counterpart, which
progressively refines the corresponding branch and the whole framework.
Furthermore, we contribute two datasets, i.e., ST-UCF-Crime and STRA,
consisting of videos containing spatio-temporal abnormal annotations to serve
as the benchmarks for WSSTAD. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and
analyze the key factors that contribute more to handle this task.]]></summary>

Organization reports that the disease still affects a significant portion of
the developing world citing increased mortality rates in the majority of low to
middle income countries. The most popular protocol pathologists use for
diagnosing breast cancer is the Nottingham grading system which grades the
proliferation of tumors based on 3 major criteria, the most important of them
being mitotic cell count. The way in which pathologists evaluate mitotic cell
count is to subjectively and qualitatively analyze cells present in stained
slides of tissue and make a decision on its mitotic state i.e. is it mitotic or
not?This process is extremely inefficient and tiring for pathologists and so an
efficient, accurate, and fully automated tool to aid with the diagnosis is
extremely desirable. Fortunately, creating such a tool is made significantly
easier with the AutoML tool available from Microsoft Azure, however to the best
of our knowledge the AutoML tool has never been formally evaluated for use in
mitotic cell detection in histopathology images. This paper serves as an
evaluation of the AutoML tool for this purpose and will provide a first look on
how the tool handles this challenging problem. All code is available

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) has become an important technique in exploiting
hyperspectral data since it decomposes a mixed pixel into a collection of
endmembers weighted by fractional abundances. The endmembers of a hyperspectral
image (HSI) are more likely to be generated by independent sources and be mixed
in a macroscopic degree before arriving at the sensor element of the imaging
spectrometer as mixed spectra. Over the past few decades, many attempts have
focused on imposing auxiliary constraints on the conventional nonnegative
matrix factorization (NMF) framework in order to effectively unmix these mixed
spectra. As a promising step toward finding an optimum constraint to extract
endmembers, this paper presents a novel blind HU algorithm, referred to as
Kurtosis-based Smooth Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (KbSNMF) which
incorporates a novel constraint based on the statistical independence of the
probability density functions of endmember spectra. Imposing this constraint on
the conventional NMF framework promotes the extraction of independent
endmembers while further enhancing the parts-based representation of data.
Experiments conducted on diverse synthetic HSI datasets (with numerous numbers
of endmembers, spectral bands, pixels, and noise levels) and three standard
real HSI datasets demonstrate the validity of the proposed KbSNMF algorithm
compared to several state-of-the-art NMF-based HU baselines. The proposed
algorithm exhibits superior performance especially in terms of extracting
endmember spectra from hyperspectral data; therefore, it could uplift the
performance of recent deep learning HU methods which utilize the endmember
spectra as supervisory input data for abundance extraction.]]></summary>

to produce a representation for all modalities using shared parameters; 2) a
novel interaction modeling technique that relies on categorical semantic
parsing of the scenes to capture interactions between target pedestrians and
their surroundings; and 3) a bifold prediction mechanism that uses both
independent and shared decoding of multimodal representations. Using public
pedestrian behavior benchmark datasets for driving, PIE and JAAD, we highlight
the benefits of the proposed method for behavior prediction and show that our

information, but acquiring such data requires a long scanning time. In this
paper, a framework called the Fused Attentive Generative Adversarial
Networks(FA-GAN) is proposed to generate the super-resolution MR image from
low-resolution magnetic resonance images, which can reduce the scanning time
effectively but with high resolution MR images. In the framework of the FA-GAN,
the local fusion feature block, consisting of different three-pass networks by
using different convolution kernels, is proposed to extract image features at
different scales. And the global feature fusion module, including the channel
attention module, the self-attention module, and the fusion operation, is
designed to enhance the important features of the MR image. Moreover, the
spectral normalization process is introduced to make the discriminator network
stable. 40 sets of 3D magnetic resonance images (each set of images contains
256 slices) are used to train the network, and 10 sets of images are used to
test the proposed method. The experimental results show that the PSNR and SSIM
values of the super-resolution magnetic resonance image generated by the
proposed FA-GAN method are higher than the state-of-the-art reconstruction
methods.]]></summary>

problems, whereby generators attempt to approach real data distributions by
virtue of adversarial learning against discriminators. The intrinsic problem
complexity poses the challenge to enhance the performance of generative
networks. In this work, we aim to boost model learning from the perspective of
network architectures, by incorporating recent progress on automated
architecture search into GANs. To this end, we propose a fully differentiable
search framework for generative adversarial networks, dubbed alphaGAN. The
searching process is formalized as solving a bi-level minimax optimization
problem, in which the outer-level objective aims for seeking a suitable network
architecture towards pure Nash Equilibrium conditioned on the generator and the
discriminator network parameters optimized with a traditional GAN loss in the
inner level. The entire optimization performs a first-order method by
alternately minimizing the two-level objective in a fully differentiable
manner, enabling architecture search to be completed in an enormous search
space. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets show that our
algorithm can obtain high-performing architectures only with 3-GPU hours on a
single GPU in the search space comprised of approximate 2 ? 1011 possible
configurations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis on the behavior of the
searching process and the properties of searched architectures, which would
benefit further research on architectures for generative models. Pretrained
models and codes are available at https://github.com/yuesongtian/AlphaGAN.]]></summary>

attention from the community, recent research argue that its performance will
suffer a cliff fall when the model size decreases. The current method mainly
relies on contrastive learning to train the network and in this work, we
propose a simple yet effective Distilled Contrastive Learning (DisCo) to ease
the issue by a large margin. Specifically, we find the final embedding obtained
by the mainstream SSL methods contains the most fruitful information, and
propose to distill the final embedding to maximally transmit a teacher's
knowledge to a lightweight model by constraining the last embedding of the
student to be consistent with that of the teacher. In addition, in the
experiment, we find that there exists a phenomenon termed Distilling BottleNeck
and present to enlarge the embedding dimension to alleviate this problem. Our
method does not introduce any extra parameter to lightweight models during
deployment. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the
state-of-the-art on all lightweight models. Particularly, when
ResNet-101/ResNet-50 is used as teacher to teach EfficientNet-B0, the linear
result of EfficientNet-B0 on ImageNet is very close to ResNet-101/ResNet-50,

annotated samples. Existing methods suffer the problem of feature undermining,
i.e. potential novel classes are treated as background during training phase.
Our method aims to alleviate this problem and enhance the feature embedding on
latent novel classes. In our work, we propose a novel joint-training framework.
Based on conventional episodic training on support-query pairs, we add an
additional mining branch that exploits latent novel classes via transferable
sub-clusters, and a new rectification technique on both background and
foreground categories to enforce more stable prototypes. Over and above that,
our transferable sub-cluster has the ability to leverage extra unlabeled data
for further feature enhancement. Extensive experiments on two FSS benchmarks
demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art by a large
margin of 3.7% mIOU on PASCAL-5i and 7.0% mIOU on COCO-20i at the cost of 74%
fewer parameters and 2.5x faster inference speed. The source code is available

the WHO declaring it as a pandemic. In this situation, it is crucial to perform

time-consuming and instead chest CT (or Chest X-ray) can be used for a fast and
accurate diagnosis. Automated diagnosis is considered to be important as it
reduces human effort and provides accurate and low-cost tests. The
contributions of our research are three-fold. First, it is aimed to analyse the
behaviour and performance of variant vision models ranging from Inception to
NAS networks with the appropriate fine-tuning procedure. Second, the behaviour
of these models is visually analysed by plotting CAMs for individual networks
and determining classification performance with AUCROC curves. Thirdly, stacked
ensembles techniques are imparted to provide higher generalisation on combining
the fine-tuned models, in which six ensemble neural networks are designed by
combining the existing fine-tuned networks. Implying these stacked ensembles
provides a great generalization to the models. The ensemble model designed by
combining all the fine-tuned networks obtained a state-of-the-art accuracy

growth of the number of parameters with respect to the number of channels in
standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Thereby our approach addresses
the redundancy in CNNs that is also exposed by the recent success of
lightweight CNNs. Lightweight CNNs can achieve comparable accuracy to standard
CNNs with fewer parameters; however, the number of weights still scales
quadratically with the CNN's width. Our MGIC architectures replace each CNN
block with an MGIC counterpart that utilizes a hierarchy of nested grouped
convolutions of small group size to address this.

Hence, our proposed architectures scale linearly with respect to the
network's width while retaining full coupling of the channels as in standard
CNNs.

Our extensive experiments on image classification, segmentation, and point
cloud classification show that applying this strategy to different
architectures like ResNet and MobileNetV3 reduces the number of parameters

of domain adaptation and generalization. Feature similarity includes both the
invariance of marginal distributions and the closeness of conditional
distributions given the desired response $y$ (e.g., class labels).
Unfortunately, traditional methods always learn such features without fully
taking into consideration the information in $y$, which in turn may lead to a
mismatch of the conditional distributions or the mix-up of discriminative
structures underlying data distributions. In this work, we introduce the
recently proposed von Neumann conditional divergence to improve the
transferability across multiple domains. We show that this new divergence is
differentiable and eligible to easily quantify the functional dependence
between features and $y$. Given multiple source tasks, we integrate this
divergence to capture discriminative information in $y$ and design novel
learning objectives assuming those source tasks are observed either
simultaneously or sequentially. In both scenarios, we obtain favorable
performance against state-of-the-art methods in terms of smaller generalization
error on new tasks and less catastrophic forgetting on source tasks (in the
sequential setup).]]></summary>

artistic effects in the photographed images, based on user input of target
image(s) or selection of pre-designed filters. These manipulations, although

option of image transformation by specifying the affect information. In this
paper we present an automatic image-transformation method that transforms the

not require a user-specified target image. The proposed algorithm uses features

user-specified emotion distribution to select multiple target images from an
image database for color transformation, such that the resultant image has
desired emotional impact. Our method can handle more diverse set of photographs

(MI) is to measure whether the myocardium segment is viable after reperfusion
or revascularization therapy. Delayed enhancement-MRI or DE-MRI, which is
performed several minutes after injection of the contrast agent, provides high
contrast between viable and nonviable myocardium and is therefore a method of
choice to evaluate the extent of MI. To automatically assess myocardial status,
the results of the EMIDEC challenge that focused on this task are presented in
this paper. The challenge's main objectives were twofold. First, to evaluate if
deep learning methods can distinguish between normal and pathological cases.
Second, to automatically calculate the extent of myocardial infarction. The
publicly available database consists of 150 exams divided into 50 cases with
normal MRI after injection of a contrast agent and 100 cases with myocardial
infarction (and then with a hyperenhanced area on DE-MRI), whatever their
inclusion in the cardiac emergency department. Along with MRI, clinical
characteristics are also provided. The obtained results issued from several
works show that the automatic classification of an exam is a reachable task
(the best method providing an accuracy of 0.92), and the automatic segmentation
of the myocardium is possible. However, the segmentation of the diseased area
needs to be improved, mainly due to the small size of these areas and the lack
of contrast with the surrounding structures.]]></summary>

lack of a comparable input model for classical algorithms. Inspired by recent
work of the author [E. Tang, STOC'19], we introduce such a model, where we
assume we can efficiently perform $\ell^2$-norm samples of input data, a
natural analogue to quantum algorithms that assume efficient state preparation
of classical data. Though this model produces less practical algorithms than
the (stronger) standard model of classical computation, it captures versions of
many of the features and nuances of quantum linear algebra algorithms. With
this model, we describe classical analogues to Lloyd, Mohseni, and Rebentrost's
quantum algorithms for principal component analysis [Nat. Phys. 10, 631 (2014)]
and nearest-centroid clustering [arXiv:1307.0411]. Since they are only
polynomially slower, these algorithms suggest that the exponential speedups of
their quantum counterparts are simply an artifact of state preparation
assumptions.]]></summary>

3D structure of dynamic targets in the wild, such as sports, medicine, and

simultaneous viewpoints of the target, (2) occlusion caused by obstacles is
frequent when tracking moving targets, and (3) the camera and vehicle state
estimation is noisy. We present a real-time aerial system for multi-camera
control that can reconstruct human motions in natural environments without the
use of special-purpose markers. We develop a multi-robot coordination scheme
that maintains the optimal flight formation for target reconstruction quality
amongst obstacles. We provide studies evaluating system performance in

task automation in environments with endless scene and object variations.
However, existing robot learning environments are limited in both scale and
diversity of 3D assets (especially of articulated objects), making it difficult
to train and evaluate the generalization ability of agents over novel objects.
In this work, we focus on object-level generalization and propose SAPIEN
Manipulation Skill Benchmark (abbreviated as ManiSkill), a large-scale
learning-from-demonstrations benchmark for articulated object manipulation with
3D visual input (point cloud and RGB-D image). ManiSkill supports object-level
variations by utilizing a rich and diverse set of articulated objects, and each
task is carefully designed for learning manipulations on a single category of
objects. We equip ManiSkill with a large number of high-quality demonstrations
to facilitate learning-from-demonstrations approaches and perform evaluations
on baseline algorithms. We believe that ManiSkill can encourage the robot
learning community to explore more on learning generalizable object
manipulation skills.]]></summary>

this virus is highly desired. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown
outstanding classification performance on image datasets. To date, it appears
that COVID computer-aided diagnosis systems based on CNNs and clinical
information have not yet been analysed or explored. We propose a novel method,
named the CNN-AE, to predict the survival chance of COVID-19 patients using a
CNN trained with clinical information. Notably, the required resources to
prepare CT images are expensive and limited compared to those required to
collect clinical data, such as blood pressure, liver disease, etc. We evaluated
our method using a publicly available clinical dataset that we collected. The
dataset properties were carefully analysed to extract important features and
compute the correlations of features. A data augmentation procedure based on
autoencoders (AEs) was proposed to balance the dataset. The experimental
results revealed that the average accuracy of the CNN-AE (96.05%) was higher
than that of the CNN (92.49%). To demonstrate the generality of our
augmentation method, we trained some existing mortality risk prediction methods
on our dataset (with and without data augmentation) and compared their
performances. We also evaluated our method using another dataset for further
generality verification. To show that clinical data can be used for COVID-19
survival chance prediction, the CNN-AE was compared with multiple pre-trained
deep models that were tuned based on CT images.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper investigates the possibility of creating a machine learning tool
that automatically determines the state of mind and emotion of an individual
through a questionnaire, without the aid of a human expert. The state of mind
and emotion is defined in this work as pertaining to preference, feelings, or
opinion that is not based on logic or reason. It is the case when a person
gives out an answer to start by saying, "I feel...". The tool is designed to
mimic the expertise of a psychologist and is built without any formal knowledge
of psychology. The idea is to build the expertise by purely computational
methods through thousands of questions collected from users. It is aimed
towards possibly diagnosing substance addiction, alcoholism, sexual attraction,
HIV status, degree of commitment, activity inclination, etc. First, the paper
presents the related literature and classifies them according to data gathering
methods. Another classification is created according to preference, emotion,
grouping, and rules to achieve a deeper interpretation and better understanding
of the state of mind and emotion. Second, the proposed tool is developed using
an online addiction questionnaire with 10 questions and 292 respondents. In
addition, an initial investigation on the dimension of addiction is presented
through the built machine learning model. Machine learning methods, namely,
artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM), are used to
determine a true or false or degree of state of a respondent.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Decision forests (Forests), in particular random forests and gradient
boosting trees, have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy compared to other
methods in many supervised learning scenarios. In particular, Forests dominate
other methods in tabular data, that is, when the feature space is unstructured,
so that the signal is invariant to a permutation of the feature indices.
However, in structured data lying on a manifold (such as images, text, and
speech) deep networks (Networks), specifically convolutional deep networks
(ConvNets), tend to outperform Forests. We conjecture that at least part of the
reason for this is that the input to Networks is not simply the feature
magnitudes, but also their indices. In contrast, naive Forest implementations
fail to explicitly consider feature indices. A recently proposed Forest
approach demonstrates that Forests, for each node, implicitly sample a random
matrix from some specific distribution. These Forests, like some classes of
Networks, learn by partitioning the feature space into convex polytopes
corresponding to linear functions. We build on that approach and show that one
can choose distributions in a manifold-aware fashion to incorporate feature
locality. We demonstrate the empirical performance on data whose features live
on three different manifolds: a torus, images, and time-series. Moreover, we
demonstrate its strength in multivariate simulated settings and also show
superiority in predicting surgical outcome in epilepsy patients and predicting
movement direction from raw stereotactic EEG data from non-motor brain regions.
In all simulations and real data, Manifold Oblique Random Forest (MORF)
algorithm outperforms approaches that ignore feature space structure and
challenges the performance of ConvNets. Moreover, MORF runs fast and maintains
interpretability and theoretical justification.]]></summary>

video. Compared to the task of scene graph generation from images, it is more
challenging because of the dynamic relationships between objects and the
temporal dependencies between frames allowing for a richer semantic
interpretation. In this paper, we propose Spatial-temporal Transformer
(STTran), a neural network that consists of two core modules: (1) a spatial
encoder that takes an input frame to extract spatial context and reason about
the visual relationships within a frame, and (2) a temporal decoder which takes
the output of the spatial encoder as input in order to capture the temporal
dependencies between frames and infer the dynamic relationships. Furthermore,
STTran is flexible to take varying lengths of videos as input without clipping,
which is especially important for long videos. Our method is validated on the
benchmark dataset Action Genome (AG). The experimental results demonstrate the
superior performance of our method in terms of dynamic scene graphs. Moreover,
a set of ablative studies is conducted and the effect of each proposed module
is justified. Code available at: https://github.com/yrcong/STTran.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While recent studies on semi-supervised learning have shown remarkable
progress in leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, most of them presume a
basic setting of the model is randomly initialized. In this work, we consider
semi-supervised learning and transfer learning jointly, leading to a more
practical and competitive paradigm that can utilize both powerful pre-trained
models from source domain as well as labeled/unlabeled data in the target
domain. To better exploit the value of both pre-trained weights and unlabeled
target examples, we introduce adaptive consistency regularization that consists
of two complementary components: Adaptive Knowledge Consistency (AKC) on the
examples between the source and target model, and Adaptive Representation
Consistency (ARC) on the target model between labeled and unlabeled examples.
Examples involved in the consistency regularization are adaptively selected
according to their potential contributions to the target task. We conduct
extensive experiments on popular benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CUB-200, and
MURA, by fine-tuning the ImageNet pre-trained ResNet-50 model. Results show
that our proposed adaptive consistency regularization outperforms
state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning techniques such as Pseudo Label, Mean
Teacher, and FixMatch. Moreover, our algorithm is orthogonal to existing
methods and thus able to gain additional improvements on top of MixMatch and
FixMatch. Our code is available at

not fit the general patterns. The concept of the anomaly is typically
ill-defined and perceived as vague and domain-dependent. Moreover, despite some
250 years of publications on the topic, no comprehensive and concrete overviews
of the different types of anomalies have hitherto been published. By means of
an extensive literature review this study therefore offers the first
theoretically principled and domain-independent typology of data anomalies and
presents a full overview of anomaly types and subtypes. To concretely define
the concept of the anomaly and its different manifestations, the typology
employs five dimensions: data type, cardinality of relationship, anomaly level,
data structure, and data distribution. These fundamental and data-centric
dimensions naturally yield 3 broad groups, 9 basic types, and 63 subtypes of
anomalies. The typology facilitates the evaluation of the functional
capabilities of anomaly detection algorithms, contributes to explainable data
science, and provides insights into relevant topics such as local versus global
anomalies.]]></summary>

with dual-representation iterative learning. In point cloud processing,
different representations have their own pros and cons. Thus, finding suitable
ways to represent point cloud data structure while keeping its own internal

problem. Therefore, we propose our work, DRINet, which serves as the basic
network structure for dual-representation learning with great flexibility at
feature transferring and less computation cost, especially for large-scale
point clouds. DRINet mainly consists of two modules called Sparse Point-Voxel
Feature Extraction and Sparse Voxel-Point Feature Extraction. By utilizing
these two modules iteratively, features can be propagated between two different
representations. We further propose a novel multi-scale pooling layer for
pointwise locality learning to improve context information propagation. Our
network achieves state-of-the-art results for point cloud classification and
segmentation tasks on several datasets while maintaining high runtime

Hence, hyperparameter optimisation is a more efficient way to improve CNNs. To

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: Accurate diagnosis of skull base tumors is essential for
providing personalized surgical treatment strategies. Intraoperative diagnosis
can be challenging due to tumor diversity and lack of intraoperative pathology
resources.

Objective: To develop an independent and parallel intraoperative pathology
workflow that can provide rapid and accurate skull base tumor diagnoses using
label-free optical imaging and artificial intelligence (AI).

Method: We used a fiber laser-based, label-free, non-consumptive,
high-resolution microscopy method ($<$ 60 sec per 1 $\times$ 1 mm$^\text{2}$),
called stimulated Raman histology (SRH), to image a consecutive, multicenter
cohort of skull base tumor patients. SRH images were then used to train a
convolutional neural network (CNN) model using three representation learning
strategies: cross-entropy, self-supervised contrastive learning, and supervised
contrastive learning. Our trained CNN models were tested on a held-out,
multicenter SRH dataset.

Results: SRH was able to image the diagnostic features of both benign and
malignant skull base tumors. Of the three representation learning strategies,
supervised contrastive learning most effectively learned the distinctive and
diagnostic SRH image features for each of the skull base tumor types. In our
multicenter testing set, cross-entropy achieved an overall diagnostic accuracy
of 91.5%, self-supervised contrastive learning 83.9%, and supervised
contrastive learning 96.6%. Our trained model was able to identify tumor-normal
margins and detect regions of microscopic tumor infiltration in whole-slide SRH
images.

Conclusion: SRH with AI models trained using contrastive representation
learning can provide rapid and accurate intraoperative diagnosis of skull base
tumors.]]></summary>

typically addressed by solving optimization problems, which are composed of
data fidelity and prior terms. Recently, several works have considered a
back-projection (BP) based fidelity term as an alternative to the common least
squares (LS), and demonstrated excellent results for popular inverse problems.
These works have also empirically shown that using the BP term, rather than the
LS term, requires fewer iterations of optimization algorithms. In this paper,
we examine the convergence rate of the projected gradient descent (PGD)
algorithm for the BP objective. Our analysis allows to identify an inherent
source for its faster convergence compared to using the LS objective, while
making only mild assumptions. We also analyze the more general proximal
gradient method under a relaxed contraction condition on the proximal mapping
of the prior. This analysis further highlights the advantage of BP when the
linear measurement operator is badly conditioned. Numerical experiments with
both $\ell_1$-norm and GAN-based priors corroborate our theoretical results.]]></summary>

transverse energy channel, but to train the algorithms we organize the data in
2D histograms instead of event-by-event arrays. This results in a large
performance boost to distinguish between standard model (SM) only and SM plus
new physics signals. We use the kinematic monojet features as input data which
allow us to describe families of models with a single data sample. We found
that the neural network performance does not depend on the simulated number of
background events if they are presented as a function of $S/\sqrt{B}$, where
$S$ and $B$ are the number of signal and background events per histogram,
respectively. This provides flexibility to the method, since testing a
particular model in that case only requires knowing the new physics monojet
cross section. Furthermore, we also discuss the network performance under
incorrect assumptions about the true DM nature. Finally, we propose multimodel
classifiers to search and identify new signals in a more general way, for the
next LHC run.]]></summary>

the learning of a small student network from a large teacher network is being
actively studied for model compression and transfer learning. However, few
studies have been performed to resolve the poor learning issue of the student
network when the student and teacher model sizes significantly differ. In this
paper, we propose a densely guided knowledge distillation using multiple
teacher assistants that gradually decreases the model size to efficiently
bridge the large gap between the teacher and student networks. To stimulate
more efficient learning of the student network, we guide each teacher assistant
to every other smaller teacher assistants iteratively. Specifically, when
teaching a smaller teacher assistant at the next step, the existing larger
teacher assistants from the previous step are used as well as the teacher
network. Moreover, we design stochastic teaching where, for each mini-batch, a
teacher or teacher assistants are randomly dropped. This acts as a regularizer
to improve the efficiency of teaching of the student network. Thus, the student
can always learn salient distilled knowledge from the multiple sources. We
verified the effectiveness of the proposed method for a classification task
using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. We also achieved significant
performance improvements with various backbone architectures such as ResNet,

development of the discipline. Domain experts are interested in error measures
relevant for their decision making needs. Such measures may produce unreliable
results. Although reliability properties of several metrics have already been
discussed, it has hardly been quantified in an objective way. We propose a
measure named Rank Stability, which evaluates how much the rankings of an
experiment differ in between similar datasets, when the models and errors are
constant. We use this to study the evaluation setup of the M5. We find that the
evaluation setup of the M5 is less reliable than other measures. The main
drivers of instability are hierarchical aggregation and scaling.
Price-weighting reduces the stability of all tested error measures. Scale
normalization of the M5 error measure results in less stability than other
scale-free errors. Hierarchical levels taken separately are less stable with
more aggregation, and their combination is even less stable than individual
levels. We also show positive tradeoffs of retaining aggregation importance
without affecting stability. Aggregation and stability can be linked to the
influence of much debated magic numbers. Many of our findings can be applied to
general hierarchical forecast benchmarking.]]></summary>

for autonomous systems to operate safelyand efficiently. Remarkably, the most
critical scenarios aremuch less frequent and more complex than the

paper, we address specifically the challenging scenarios at the long tail of
the dataset distribution. Our analysis shows that the common losses tend to

we propose to supplement the usual loss with aloss that places challenging
cases closer to each other. This triggers sharing information among challenging
cases andlearning specific predictive features. We show on four public datasets
that this leads to improved performance on the challenging scenarios while the
overall performance stays stable. The approach is agnostic w.r.t. the used

synthesize raw image data under different camera settings, including exposure
time, ISO, and aperture. The proposed simulator includes an exposure module
that utilizes the principle of modern lens designs for correcting the luminance
level. It also contains a noise module using the noise level function and an
aperture module with adaptive attention to simulate the side effects on noise
and defocus blur. To facilitate the learning of a simulator model, we collect a
dataset of the 10,000 raw images of 450 scenes with different exposure
settings. Quantitative experiments and qualitative comparisons show that our
approach outperforms relevant baselines in raw data synthesize on multiple
cameras. Furthermore, the camera simulator enables various applications,
including large-aperture enhancement, HDR, auto exposure, and data augmentation
for training local feature detectors. Our work represents the first attempt to
simulate a camera sensor's behavior leveraging both the advantage of
traditional raw sensor features and the power of data-driven deep learning.]]></summary>

and inference times, which is crucial for training in resource constrained
environments or time critical inference applications. State-of-the-art (SOTA)
quantization approaches focus on post-training quantization, i.e. quantization
of pre-trained DNNs for speeding up inference. Very little work on quantized
training exists, which neither al-lows dynamic intra-epoch precision switches
nor em-ploys an information theory based switching heuristic. Usually, existing
approaches require full precision refinement afterwards and enforce a global
word length across the whole DNN. This leads to suboptimal quantization
mappings and resource usage. Recognizing these limits, we introduce MARViN, a
new quantized training strategy using information theory-based intra-epoch
precision switching, which decides on a per-layer basis which precision should
be used in order to minimize quantization-induced information loss. Note that
any quantization must leave enough precision such that future learning steps do
not suffer from vanishing gradients. We achieve an average speedup of 1.86
compared to a float32 basis while limiting mean accuracy degradation on
AlexNet/ResNet to only -0.075%.]]></summary>

to new tasks, as they are trained exclusively for specific objectives and
require massive amounts of interaction to learn new skills. Meta-reinforcement
learning (meta-RL) addresses this challenge by leveraging knowledge learned
from training tasks to perform well in previously unseen tasks. However,
current meta-RL approaches limit themselves to narrow parametric task
distributions, ignoring qualitative differences between tasks that occur in the
real world. In this paper, we introduce TIGR, a Task-Inference-based meta-RL
algorithm using Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and gated Recurrent units,
designed for tasks in non-parametric environments. We employ a generative model
involving a GMM to capture the multi-modality of the tasks. We decouple the
policy training from the task-inference learning and efficiently train the
inference mechanism on the basis of an unsupervised reconstruction objective.
We provide a benchmark with qualitatively distinct tasks based on the
half-cheetah environment and demonstrate the superior performance of TIGR
compared to state-of-the-art meta-RL approaches in terms of sample efficiency
(3-10 times faster), asymptotic performance, and applicability in
non-parametric environments with zero-shot adaptation.]]></summary>

combine non-invasive image analysis and machine learning, have been
successfully applied to identify and quantify plant health and diseases.
However, these techniques usually do not consider the progressive nature of
plant stress and often require images showing severe signs of stress to ensure
high confidence detection, thereby reducing the feasibility for early detection
and recovery of plants under stress. To overcome the problem mentioned above,
we propose a deep learning pipeline for the temporal analysis of the visual
changes induced in the plant due to stress and apply it for the specific case
of water stress identification in Chickpea plant shoot images. For this, we
have considered an image dataset of two chickpea varieties JG-62 and Pusa-372,
under three water stress conditions; control, young seedling, and before
flowering, captured over five months. We have employed a variant of the
Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN) to learn spatio-temporal
patterns from the chickpea plant dataset and use them for water stress
classification. Our model has achieved ceiling level classification performance
of 98.52% on JG-62 and 97.78% on Pusa-372 chickpea plant data and has
outperformed the state-of-the-art time-invariant technique by at least 14% for
both JG-62 and Pusa-372 species, to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, our
LRCN model has demonstrated robustness to noisy input, with a less than 2.5%
dip in average model accuracy and a small standard deviation about the mean for
both species. Lastly, we have performed an ablation study to analyze the
performance of the LRCN model by decreasing the number of temporal session data
used for training.]]></summary>

annotation budget constraints are taken into consideration, appropriately
coined Budget Aware Object Detection (BAOD). When provided with a fixed budget,
we propose a strategy for building a diverse and informative dataset that can
be used to optimally train a robust detector. We investigate both optimization
and learning-based methods to sample which images to annotate and what type of
annotation (strongly or weakly supervised) to annotate them with. We adopt a
hybrid supervised learning framework to train the object detector from both
these types of annotation. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study showing
that a handcrafted optimization method outperforms other selection techniques
including random sampling, uncertainty sampling and active learning. By
combining an optimal image/annotation selection scheme with hybrid supervised
learning to solve the BAOD problem, we show that one can achieve the
performance of a strongly supervised detector on PASCAL-VOC 2007 while saving
12.8% of its original annotation budget. Furthermore, when $100\%$ of the

(image recognition, decision-making, NLP, image synthesis), self-driving
technology has not yet followed the same trend. In this paper, we study the

stack. We argue that the slow progress is caused by approaches that require too
much hand-engineering, an over-reliance on road testing, and high fleet
deployment costs. We observe that the classical stack has several bottlenecks
that preclude the necessary scale needed to capture the long tail of rare
events. To resolve these problems, we outline the principles of Autonomy 2.0,
an ML-first approach to self-driving, as a viable alternative to the currently
adopted state-of-the-art. This approach is based on (i) a fully differentiable
AV stack trainable from human demonstrations, (ii) closed-loop data-driven
reactive simulation, and (iii) large-scale, low-cost data collections as
critical solutions towards scalability issues. We outline the general
architecture, survey promising works in this direction and propose key

real-world applications. Existing shape completion methods tend to generate
rough shapes without fine-grained details. Considering this, we introduce a
two-branch network for shape completion. The first branch is a cascaded shape
completion sub-network to synthesize complete objects, where we propose to use
the partial input together with the coarse output to preserve the object
details during the dense point reconstruction. The second branch is an
auto-encoder to reconstruct the original partial input. The two branches share
a same feature extractor to learn an accurate global feature for shape

our network when ground truth data are not available. This is to mitigate the
dependence of existing approaches on large amounts of ground truth training
data that are often difficult to obtain in real-world applications.
Additionally, our proposed strategies are also able to improve the
reconstruction quality for fully supervised learning. We verify our approach in
self-supervised, semi-supervised and fully supervised settings with superior

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multivariate time series anomaly detection is a very common problem in the
field of failure prevention. Fast prevention means lower repair costs and
losses. The amount of sensors in novel industry systems makes the anomaly
detection process quite difficult for humans. Algorithms which automates the
process of detecting anomalies are crucial in modern failure-prevention
systems. Therefore, many machine and deep learning models have been designed to
address this problem. Mostly, they are autoencoder-based architectures with
some generative adversarial elements. In this work, a framework is shown which
incorporates neuroevolution methods to boost the anomaly-detection scores of
new and already known models. The presented approach adapts evolution
strategies for evolving ensemble model, in which every single model works on a
subgroup of data sensors. The next goal of neuroevolution is to optimise
architecture and hyperparameters like window size, the number of layers, layer
depths, etc. The proposed framework shows that it is possible to boost most of
the anomaly detection deep learning models in a reasonable time and a fully
automated mode. The tests were run on SWAT and WADI datasets. To our knowledge,
this is the first approach in which an ensemble deep learning anomaly detection
model is built in a fully automatic way using a neuroevolution strategy.]]></summary>

by the computational engine of a machine learning system? Current machine
learning systems typically push whole tensors through a series of compute
kernels such as matrix multiplications or activation functions, where each
kernel runs on an AI accelerator (ASIC) such as a GPU. This implementation
abstraction provides little built-in support for ML systems to scale past a
single machine, or for handling large models with matrices or tensors that do
not easily fit into the RAM of an ASIC. In this paper, we present an
alternative implementation abstraction called the tensor relational algebra
(TRA). The TRA is a set-based algebra based on the relational algebra.
Expressions in the TRA operate over binary tensor relations, where keys are
multi-dimensional arrays and values are tensors. The TRA is easily executed
with high efficiency in a parallel or distributed environment, and amenable to
automatic optimization. Our empirical study shows that the optimized TRA-based
back-end can significantly outperform alternatives for running ML workflows in
distributed clusters.]]></summary>

rhythmically along with the music. These dance movements are usually made up of
dance movements you have seen before. In this paper, we propose to reproduce
such an inherent capability of the human-being within a computer vision system.
The proposed system consists of three modules. To explore the relationship
between music and dance movements, we propose a cross-modal alignment module
that focuses on dancing video clips, accompanied on pre-designed music, to
learn a system that can judge the consistency between the visual features of
pose sequences and the acoustic features of music. The learned model is then
used in the imagination module to select a pose sequence for the given music.
Such pose sequence selected from the music, however, is usually discontinuous.
To solve this problem, in the spatial-temporal alignment module we develop a
spatial alignment algorithm based on the tendency and periodicity of dance
movements to predict dance movements between discontinuous fragments. In
addition, the selected pose sequence is often misaligned with the music beat.
To solve this problem, we further develop a temporal alignment algorithm to
align the rhythm of music and dance. Finally, the processed pose sequence is
used to synthesize realistic dancing videos in the imagination module. The
generated dancing videos match the content and rhythm of the music.
Experimental results and subjective evaluations show that the proposed approach
can perform the function of generating promising dancing videos by inputting
music.]]></summary>

has been greatly advanced by exploiting the outputs of Class Activation Map
(CAM) to generate the pseudo labels for semantic segmentation. However, CAM
merely discovers seeds from a small number of regions, which may be
insufficient to serve as pseudo masks for semantic segmentation. In this paper,
we formulate the expansion of object regions in CAM as an increase in
information. From the perspective of information theory, we propose a novel
Complementary Patch (CP) Representation and prove that the information of the
sum of the CAMs by a pair of input images with complementary hidden (patched)
parts, namely CP Pair, is greater than or equal to the information of the
baseline CAM. Therefore, a CAM with more information related to object seeds
can be obtained by narrowing down the gap between the sum of CAMs generated by
the CP Pair and the original CAM. We propose a CP Network (CPN) implemented by
a triplet network and three regularization functions. To further improve the
quality of the CAMs, we propose a Pixel-Region Correlation Module (PRCM) to
augment the contextual information by using object-region relations between the
feature maps and the CAMs. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets
show that our proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art in WSSS,
validating the effectiveness of our CP Representation and CPN.]]></summary>

samples from novel categories unobserved in external source domain.
Unfortunately, existing OSDA methods always ignore the demand for the
information of unseen categories and simply recognize them as "unknown" set
without further explanation. This motivates us to understand the unknown
categories more specifically by exploring the underlying structures and
recovering their interpretable semantic attributes. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework to accurately identify the seen categories in target domain,
and effectively recover the semantic attributes for unseen categories.
Specifically, structure preserving partial alignment is developed to recognize
the seen categories through domain-invariant feature learning. Attribute
propagation over visual graph is designed to smoothly transit attributes from
seen to unseen categories via visual-semantic mapping. Moreover, two new
cross-main benchmarks are constructed to evaluate the proposed framework in the
novel and practical challenge. Experimental results on open-set recognition and
semantic recovery demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other

imperceptible perturbation can trigger dramatic changes in the ranking result.
While previous attempts focus on manipulating absolute ranks of certain
candidates, the possibility of adjusting their relative order remains
under-explored. In this paper, we formulate a new adversarial attack against
deep ranking systems, i.e., the Order Attack, which covertly alters the
relative order among a selected set of candidates according to an
attacker-specified permutation, with limited interference to other unrelated
candidates. Specifically, it is formulated as a triplet-style loss imposing an
inequality chain reflecting the specified permutation. However, direct
optimization of such white-box objective is infeasible in a real-world attack
scenario due to various black-box limitations. To cope with them, we propose a
Short-range Ranking Correlation metric as a surrogate objective for black-box
Order Attack to approximate the white-box method. The Order Attack is evaluated
on the Fashion-MNIST and Stanford-Online-Products datasets under both white-box
and black-box threat models. The black-box attack is also successfully
implemented on a major e-commerce platform. Comprehensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, revealing a

three-dimensional (3D) shape. Deep generative models have been adapted to model
their variations typically using a map from a ball-like set of latent
variables. However, previous approaches did not pay much attention to the
topological structure of a point cloud, despite that a continuous map cannot
express the varying numbers of holes and intersections. Moreover, a point cloud
is often composed of multiple subparts, and it is also difficult to express. In
this study, we propose ChartPointFlow, a flow-based generative model with
multiple latent labels for 3D point clouds. Each label is assigned to points in
an unsupervised manner. Then, a map conditioned on a label is assigned to a
continuous subset of a point cloud, similar to a chart of a manifold. This
enables our proposed model to preserve the topological structure with clear
boundaries, whereas previous approaches tend to generate blurry point clouds
and fail to generate holes. The experimental results demonstrate that
ChartPointFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of generation and
reconstruction compared with other point cloud generators. Moreover,
ChartPointFlow divides an object into semantic subparts using charts, and it

network architectures, by incorporating recent progress on automated
architecture search into GANs. To this end, we propose a fully differentiable

searching process is formalized as solving a bi-level minimax optimization
problem, in which the outer-level objective aims for seeking a suitable network
architecture towards pure Nash Equilibrium conditioned on the generator and the
discriminator network parameters optimized with a traditional GAN loss in the
inner level. The entire optimization performs a first-order method by
alternately minimizing the two-level objective in a fully differentiable
manner, enabling architecture search to be completed in an enormous search

algorithm can obtain high-performing architectures only with 3-GPU hours on a
single GPU in the search space comprised of approximate 2 ? 1011 possible

the common characteristics between objects having the same underlying

promising progress these days, the performance of these methods still cannot
match the latest compression standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC). Most of the
recent developments focus on designing a more accurate and flexible entropy

However, few efforts are devoted to structuring a better transformation between
the image space and the latent feature space. In this paper, instead of
employing previous autoencoder style networks to build this transformation, we
propose an enhanced Invertible Encoding Network with invertible neural networks

3D object detector with a voxel-to-point decoder. To preserve the necessary
information from all raw points and maintain the high box recall in voxel based
Region Proposal Network (RPN), we propose a residual voxel-to-point decoder to
extract the point features in addition to the map-view features from the voxel

features with the proposal boxes for accurately perceiving the object position.
The RoI-Aligned features are finally aggregated with the corner geometry
embeddings that can provide the potentially missing corner information in the
box refinement stage. We propose a simple and efficient method to align the
estimated IoUs to the refined proposal boxes as a more relevant localization

complexity of the glyph shapes or underlying structures and large numbers of
existed characters, when comparing with English letters. Moreover, the
handwriting of calligraphy masters has a more irregular stroke and is difficult
to obtain in real-world scenarios. Recently, several GAN-based methods have
been proposed for font synthesis, but some of them require numerous reference
data and the other part of them have cumbersome preprocessing steps to divide
the character into different parts to be learned and transferred separately. In
this paper, we propose a simple but powerful end-to-end Chinese calligraphy
font generation framework ZiGAN, which does not require any manual operation or
redundant preprocessing to generate fine-grained target-style characters with
few-shot references. To be specific, a few paired samples from different
character styles are leveraged to attain a fine-grained correlation between
structures underlying different glyphs. To capture valuable style knowledge in
target and strengthen the coarse-grained understanding of character content, we
utilize multiple unpaired samples to align the feature distributions belonging
to different character styles. By doing so, only a few target Chinese
calligraphy characters are needed to generated expected style transferred
characters. Experiments demonstrate that our method has a state-of-the-art
generalization ability in few-shot Chinese character style transfer.]]></summary>

source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Although the domain shifts may
exist in various dimensions such as appearance, textures, etc, the contextual
dependency, which is generally shared across different domains, is neglected by
recent methods. In this paper, we utilize this important clue as explicit prior
knowledge and propose end-to-end Context-Aware Mixup (CAMix) for domain
adaptive semantic segmentation. Firstly, we design a contextual mask generation
strategy by leveraging accumulated spatial distributions and contextual
relationships. The generated contextual mask is critical in this work and will
guide the domain mixup. In addition, we define the significance mask to
indicate where the pixels are credible. To alleviate the over-alignment (e.g.,
early performance degradation), the source and target significance masks are
mixed based on the contextual mask into the mixed significance mask, and we
introduce a significance-reweighted consistency loss on it. Experimental
results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods

anchor-based methods, while the efficient but challenging anchor-free
single-stage 3D object detection is not well investigated. Recent studies on 2D

However, the unordered and sparse properties of point clouds prevent us from
directly leveraging the advanced 2D methods on 3D point clouds. We overcome
this by converting the voxel-based sparse 3D feature volumes into the sparse 2D
feature maps. We propose an attentive module to fit the sparse feature maps to
dense mostly on the object regions through the deformable convolution tower and
the supervised mask-guided attention. By directly regressing the 3D bounding
box from the enhanced and dense feature maps, we construct a novel single-stage
3D detector for point clouds in an anchor-free manner. We propose an IoU-based
detection confidence re-calibration scheme to improve the correlation between
the detection confidence score and the accuracy of the bounding box regression.

object detection and segmentation have seen a great improvement in performance.
However, in many real-world applications such as autonomous driving vehicles,
the risk associated with incorrect predictions of objects is very high.
Standard deep learning models for object detection such as YOLO models are
often overconfident in their predictions and do not take into account the
uncertainty in predictions on out-of-distribution data. In this work, we
propose an efficient and effective approach to model uncertainty in object

YOLO. We show that this leads to a Bayesian convolutional neural network
capable of capturing the epistemic uncertainty in the model. Additionally, we
capture the aleatoric uncertainty using a Gaussian likelihood. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach on modeling uncertainty in object

Experimental results show that MC-DropBlock improves the generalization,

Recent deep learning models often have very large memory footprints and a high
computational cost associated with training and drawing inferences. Lottery
Ticket Hypothesis is used to prune the networks to find smaller sub-networks
that at least match the performance of the original model in terms of test
accuracy in a similar number of iterations. We used CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
ImageNet datasets to perform image classification tasks and observe that the

family that drew attention due to its unique ability to maintain the
equivariance property by preserving the spatial relationship amongst the
features. The capsule network has attained unprecedented success over image
classification tasks with datasets such as MNIST and affNIST by encoding the
characteristic features into the capsules and building the parse-tree
structure. However, on the datasets involving complex foreground and background
regions such as CIFAR-10, the performance of the capsule network is sub-optimal
due to its naive data routing policy and incompetence towards extracting
complex features. This paper proposes a new design strategy for capsule network
architecture for efficiently dealing with complex images. The proposed method
incorporates wide bottleneck residual modules and the Squeeze and Excitation
attention blocks upheld by the modified FM routing algorithm to address the
defined problem. A wide bottleneck residual module facilitates extracting
complex features followed by the squeeze and excitation attention block to
enable channel-wise attention by suppressing the trivial features. This setup
allows channel inter-dependencies at almost no computational cost, thereby
enhancing the representation ability of capsules on complex images. We
extensively evaluate the performance of the proposed model on three publicly
available datasets, namely CIFAR-10, Fashion MNIST, and SVHN, to outperform the
top-5 performance on CIFAR-10 and Fashion MNIST with highly competitive

object in a video sequence given only a mask annotation in the first frame. The
limited information available makes it an extremely challenging task. Most
previous best-performing methods adopt matching-based transductive reasoning or
online inductive learning. Nevertheless, they are either less discriminative
for similar instances or insufficient in the utilization of spatio-temporal
information. In this work, we propose to integrate transductive and inductive
learning into a unified framework to exploit the complementarity between them
for accurate and robust video object segmentation. The proposed approach
consists of two functional branches. The transduction branch adopts a
lightweight transformer architecture to aggregate rich spatio-temporal cues
while the induction branch performs online inductive learning to obtain
discriminative target information. To bridge these two diverse branches, a
two-head label encoder is introduced to learn the suitable target prior for
each of them. The generated mask encodings are further forced to be
disentangled to better retain their complementarity. Extensive experiments on
several prevalent benchmarks show that, without the need of synthetic training
data, the proposed approach sets a series of new state-of-the-art records. Code

realistic, diverse, and complex, aiming to reproduce the challenges that agents
must face in the real world. Building such a benchmark poses three fundamental
difficulties for each activity: definition (it can differ by time, place, or
person), instantiation in a simulator, and evaluation. BEHAVIOR addresses these
with three innovations. First, we propose an object-centric, predicate
logic-based description language for expressing an activity's initial and goal
conditions, enabling generation of diverse instances for any activity. Second,
we identify the simulator-agnostic features required by an underlying
environment to support BEHAVIOR, and demonstrate its realization in one such
simulator. Third, we introduce a set of metrics to measure task progress and
efficiency, absolute and relative to human demonstrators. We include 500 human
demonstrations in virtual reality (VR) to serve as the human ground truth. Our

information compared with monocular images and have facilitated a wide range of
measurement applications. Light field image capturing devices usually suffer
from the inherent trade-off between the angular and spatial resolutions. To
tackle this problem, several methods, such as light field reconstruction and
light field super-resolution, have been proposed but leaving two problems
unaddressed, namely domain asymmetry and efficient information flow. In this
paper, we propose an end-to-end Spatio-Angular Dense Network (SADenseNet) for
light field reconstruction with two novel components, namely correlation blocks
and spatio-angular dense skip connections to address them. The former performs
effective modeling of the correlation information in a way that conforms with
the domain asymmetry. And the latter consists of three kinds of connections
enhancing the information flow within two domains. Extensive experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets have been conducted to demonstrate that

reconstructed light field images are sharp with correct details and can serve

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this work, we address the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for
person re-ID where annotations are available for the source domain but not for
target. Previous methods typically follow a two-stage optimization pipeline,
where the network is first pre-trained on source and then fine-tuned on target
with pseudo labels created by feature clustering. Such methods sustain two main
limitations. (1) The label noise may hinder the learning of discriminative
features for recognizing target classes. (2) The domain gap may hinder
knowledge transferring from source to target. We propose three types of
technical schemes to alleviate these issues. First, we propose a cluster-wise
contrastive learning algorithm (CCL) by iterative optimization of feature
learning and cluster refinery to learn noise-tolerant representations in the
unsupervised manner. Second, we adopt a progressive domain adaptation (PDA)
strategy to gradually mitigate the domain gap between source and target data.
Third, we propose Fourier augmentation (FA) for further maximizing the class
separability of re-ID models by imposing extra constraints in the Fourier
space. We observe that these proposed schemes are capable of facilitating the
learning of discriminative feature representations. Experiments demonstrate
that our method consistently achieves notable improvements over the
state-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods on multiple benchmarks, e.g.,
surpassing MMT largely by 8.1\%, 9.9\%, 11.4\% and 11.1\% mAP on the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The selective visual attention mechanism in the human visual system (HVS)
restricts the amount of information to reach visual awareness for perceiving
natural scenes, allowing near real-time information processing with limited
computational capacity [Koch and Ullman, 1987]. This kind of selectivity acts
as an 'Information Bottleneck (IB)', which seeks a trade-off between
information compression and predictive accuracy. However, such information
constraints are rarely explored in the attention mechanism for deep neural
networks (DNNs). In this paper, we propose an IB-inspired spatial attention
module for DNN structures built for visual recognition. The module takes as
input an intermediate representation of the input image, and outputs a
variational 2D attention map that minimizes the mutual information (MI) between
the attention-modulated representation and the input, while maximizing the MI
between the attention-modulated representation and the task label. To further
restrict the information bypassed by the attention map, we quantize the
continuous attention scores to a set of learnable anchor values during
training. Extensive experiments show that the proposed IB-inspired spatial
attention mechanism can yield attention maps that neatly highlight the regions
of interest while suppressing backgrounds, and bootstrap standard DNN
structures for visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification,
fine-grained recognition, cross-domain classification). The attention maps are
interpretable for the decision making of the DNNs as verified in the
experiments. Our code is available at https://github.com/ashleylqx/AIB.git.]]></summary>

class-dependent image feature maps and a new encoding layer to exploit the
geometric continuity feature representation by fusing both spatial and visual
information of lane together. The ContinuityLearner, performing on the
geometric continuity feature of lanes, is trained to directly predict the lane

scenes, salient object detection (SOD) plays an essential role in various
computer vision systems. Coming to the era of high resolution, SOD methods are
facing new challenges. The major limitation of previous methods is that they
try to identify the salient regions and estimate the accurate objects
boundaries simultaneously with a single regression task at low-resolution. This
practice ignores the inherent difference between the two difficult problems,
resulting in poor detection quality. In this paper, we propose a novel deep
learning framework for high-resolution SOD task, which disentangles the task
into a low-resolution saliency classification network (LRSCN) and a
high-resolution refinement network (HRRN). As a pixel-wise classification task,
LRSCN is designed to capture sufficient semantics at low-resolution to identify
the definite salient, background and uncertain image regions. HRRN is a
regression task, which aims at accurately refining the saliency value of pixels
in the uncertain region to preserve a clear object boundary at high-resolution
with limited GPU memory. It is worth noting that by introducing uncertainty
into the training process, our HRRN can well address the high-resolution
refinement task without using any high-resolution training data. Extensive
experiments on high-resolution saliency datasets as well as some widely used
saliency benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves superior performance

key idea is to leverage the generative facial priors embedded in the
off-the-shelf pretrained StyleGAN2. To achieve this, we formulate the shadow
removal task as a layer decomposition problem: a shadowed portrait image is
constructed by the blending of a shadow image and a shadow-free image. We
propose an effective progressive optimization algorithm to learn the
decomposition process. Our approach can also be extended to portrait tattoo
removal and watermark removal. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on a
real-world portrait shadow dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves
comparable performance with supervised shadow removal methods. Our source code

indoor location based services. One of the key challenges in the proliferation
of indoor location based services is the unavailability of indoor spatial maps
due to the complex nature of capturing an indoor space model (e.g., floor plan)
of an existing building. In this paper, we propose a system to automatically
generate floor plans that can recognize rooms from the point-clouds obtained
through smartphones like Google's Tango. In particular, we propose two
approaches - a Recurrent Neural Network based approach using Pointer Network
and a Convolutional Neural Network based approach using Mask-RCNN to identify
rooms (and thereby floor plans) from point-clouds. Experimental results on
different datasets demonstrate approximately 0.80-0.90 Intersection-over-Union

regenerate the shapes of the rooms in heterogeneous environment.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fine-tuning from pre-trained ImageNet models has been a simple, effective,
and popular approach for various computer vision tasks. The common practice of
fine-tuning is to adopt a default hyperparameter setting with a fixed
pre-trained model, while both of them are not optimized for specific tasks and
time constraints. Moreover, in cloud computing or GPU clusters where the tasks
arrive sequentially in a stream, faster online fine-tuning is a more desired
and realistic strategy for saving money, energy consumption, and CO2 emission.
In this paper, we propose a joint Neural Architecture Search and Online
Adaption framework named NASOA towards a faster task-oriented fine-tuning upon
the request of users. Specifically, NASOA first adopts an offline NAS to
identify a group of training-efficient networks to form a pretrained model zoo.
We propose a novel joint block and macro-level search space to enable a
flexible and efficient search. Then, by estimating fine-tuning performance via
an adaptive model by accumulating experience from the past tasks, an online
schedule generator is proposed to pick up the most suitable model and generate
a personalized training regime with respect to each desired task in a one-shot
fashion. The resulting model zoo is more training efficient than SOTA models,
e.g. 6x faster than RegNetY-16GF, and 1.7x faster than EfficientNetB3.
Experiments on multiple datasets also show that NASOA achieves much better
fine-tuning results, i.e. improving around 2.1% accuracy than the best
performance in RegNet series under various constraints and tasks; 40x faster
compared to the BOHB.]]></summary>

Currently, the primary goal of plant phenotyping is to raise the accuracy of

neural network, a new end-to-end model to delineate each leaf region and count
the number of leaves, with two main components: 1) the mask assembly module
merging position-sensitive bases of each predicted box after non-maximum
suppression (NMS) and corresponding coefficients to generate original masks; 2)
the mask refining module elaborating leaf boundaries from the mask assembly
module by the point selection strategy and predictor. In addition, we also
design a novel and flexible multi-scale attention module for the dual
attention-guided mask (DAG-Mask) branch to effectively enhance information
expression and produce more accurate bases. Our main contribution is to
generate the final improved masks by combining the mask assembly module with
the mask refining module under the anchor-free instance segmentation paradigm.
We validate our LeafMask through extensive experiments on Leaf Segmentation

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Domain adaptation aims to bridge the domain shifts between the source and
target domains. These shifts may span different dimensions such as fog,
rainfall, etc. However, recent methods typically do not consider explicit prior
knowledge on a specific dimension, thus leading to less desired adaptation
performance. In this paper, we study a practical setting called Specific Domain
Adaptation (SDA) that aligns the source and target domains in a
demanded-specific dimension. Within this setting, we observe the intra-domain
gap induced by different domainness (i.e., numerical magnitudes of this
dimension) is crucial when adapting to a specific domain. To address the
problem, we propose a novel Self-Adversarial Disentangling (SAD) framework. In
particular, given a specific dimension, we first enrich the source domain by
introducing a domainness creator with providing additional supervisory signals.
Guided by the created domainness, we design a self-adversarial regularizer and
two loss functions to jointly disentangle the latent representations into
domainness-specific and domainness-invariant features, thus mitigating the
intra-domain gap. Our method can be easily taken as a plug-and-play framework
and does not introduce any extra costs in the inference time. We achieve
consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both object detection

real-world scenes, many existing reflection removal methods are trained on
synthetic data plus a small amount of real-world data, which makes it difficult
to evaluate the strengths or weaknesses of different reflection removal methods
thoroughly. Furthermore, existing real-world benchmarks and datasets do not
categorize image data based on the types and appearances of reflection (e.g.,
smoothness, intensity), making it hard to analyze reflection removal methods.
Hence, we construct a new reflection removal dataset that is categorized,
diverse, and real-world (CDR). A pipeline based on RAW data is used to capture
perfectly aligned input images and transmission images. The dataset is
constructed using diverse glass types under various environments to ensure
diversity. By analyzing several reflection removal methods and conducting
extensive experiments on our dataset, we show that state-of-the-art reflection
removal methods generally perform well on blurry reflection but fail in
obtaining satisfying performance on other types of real-world reflection. We

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Faces manifest large variations in many aspects, such as identity,
expression, pose, and face styling. Therefore, it is a great challenge to
disentangle and extract these characteristics from facial images, especially in
an unsupervised manner. In this work, we introduce cycle-consistency in facial
characteristics as free supervisory signal to learn facial representations from
unlabeled facial images. The learning is realized by superimposing the facial
motion cycle-consistency and identity cycle-consistency constraints. The main
idea of the facial motion cycle-consistency is that, given a face with
expression, we can perform de-expression to a neutral face via the removal of
facial motion and further perform re-expression to reconstruct back to the
original face. The main idea of the identity cycle-consistency is to exploit
both de-identity into mean face by depriving the given neutral face of its
identity via feature re-normalization and re-identity into neutral face by
adding the personal attributes to the mean face. At training time, our model
learns to disentangle two distinct facial representations to be useful for
performing cycle-consistent face reconstruction. At test time, we use the
linear protocol scheme for evaluating facial representations on various tasks,
including facial expression recognition and head pose regression. We also can
directly apply the learnt facial representations to person recognition,
frontalization and image-to-image translation. Our experiments show that the
results of our approach is competitive with those of existing methods,
demonstrating the rich and unique information embedded in the disentangled
representations. Code is available at https://github.com/JiaRenChang/FaceCycle .]]></summary>

conversation. The task of identifying the main speaker (who is properly taking
his/her turn of speaking) and the interrupters (who are interrupting or
reacting to the main speaker's utterances) remains a challenging task. Although
some prior methods have partially addressed this task, there still remain some
limitations. Firstly, a direct association of Audio and Visual features may
limit the correlations to be extracted due to different modalities. Secondly,
the relationship across temporal segments helping to maintain the consistency
of localization, separation, and conversation contexts is not effectively
exploited. Finally, the interactions between speakers that usually contain the
tracking and anticipatory decisions about the transition to a new speaker are
usually ignored. Therefore, this work introduces a new Audio-Visual Transformer
approach to the problem of localization and highlighting the main speaker in
both audio and visual channels of a multi-speaker conversation video in the
wild. The proposed method exploits different types of correlations presented in
both visual and audio signals. The temporal audio-visual relationships across
spatial-temporal space are anticipated and optimized via the self-attention
mechanism in a Transformerstructure. Moreover, a newly collected dataset is
introduced for the main speaker detection. To the best of our knowledge, it is
one of the first studies that is able to automatically localize and highlight
the main speaker in both visual and audio channels in multi-speaker
conversation videos.]]></summary>

like RGB, depth maps or 3D-skeleton sequences when only limited
modality-specific labeled examples are available. For the RGB, and derived
optical-flow, modality many large-scale labeled datasets have been made
available. They have become the de facto pre-training choice when recognizing
or detecting new actions from RGB datasets that have limited amounts of labeled
examples available. Unfortunately, large-scale labeled action datasets for
other modalities are unavailable for pre-training. In this paper, our goal is
to recognize actions from limited examples in non-RGB video modalities, by
learning from large-scale labeled RGB data. To this end, we propose a two-step
training process: (i) we extract action representation knowledge from an
RGB-trained teacher network and adapt it to a non-RGB student network. (ii) we
then fine-tune the transfer model with available labeled examples of the target
modality. For the knowledge transfer we introduce feature-supervision
strategies, which rely on unlabeled pairs of two modalities (the RGB and the
target modality) to transfer feature level representations from the teacher to
the student network. Ablations and generalizations with two RGB source datasets
and two non-RGB target datasets demonstrate that an optical-flow teacher
provides better action transfer features than RGB for both depth maps and
3D-skeletons, even when evaluated on a different target domain, or for a
different task. Compared to alternative cross-modal action transfer methods we
show a good improvement in performance especially when labeled non-RGB examples
to learn from are scarce]]></summary>

predicting precise start and end times for different actions in any video. In

of simulation has skewed the attention to tasks that only require what robotics
simulators can simulate: motion and physical contact. We present iGibson 2.0,
an open-source simulation environment that supports the simulation of a more
diverse set of household tasks through three key innovations. First, iGibson
2.0 supports object states, including temperature, wetness level, cleanliness
level, and toggled and sliced states, necessary to cover a wider range of
tasks. Second, iGibson 2.0 implements a set of predicate logic functions that
map the simulator states to logic states like Cooked or Soaked. Additionally,
given a logic state, iGibson 2.0 can sample valid physical states that satisfy
it. This functionality can generate potentially infinite instances of tasks
with minimal effort from the users. The sampling mechanism allows our scenes to
be more densely populated with small objects in semantically meaningful
locations. Third, iGibson 2.0 includes a virtual reality (VR) interface to
immerse humans in its scenes to collect demonstrations. As a result, we can
collect demonstrations from humans on these new types of tasks, and use them
for imitation learning. We evaluate the new capabilities of iGibson 2.0 to
enable robot learning of novel tasks, in the hope of demonstrating the
potential of this new simulator to support new research in embodied AI. iGibson

relies on large labeled datasets for model training. However, acquiring and
manually labeling a large medical image set is resource-intensive, expensive,

this challenge, we propose an adversarial data augmentation approach to improve
the efficiency in utilizing training data and to enlarge the dataset via
simulated but realistic transformations. Specifically, we present a generic
task-driven learning framework, which jointly optimizes a data augmentation
model and a segmentation network during training, generating informative
examples to enhance network generalizability for the downstream task. The data
augmentation model utilizes a set of photometric and geometric image
transformations and chains them to simulate realistic complex imaging
variations that could exist in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The proposed
adversarial data augmentation does not rely on generative networks and can be
used as a plug-in module in general segmentation networks. It is
computationally efficient and applicable for both supervised and
semi-supervised learning. We analyze and evaluate the method on two MR image

log-likelihood with the sequence cross entropy loss, which encourages an exact
token-by-token match between a target sequence with a generated sequence. Such
training objective is sub-optimal when the target sequence not perfect, e.g.,
when the target sequence is corrupted with noises, or when only weak sequence
supervision is available. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
Edit-Invariant Sequence Loss (EISL), which computes the matching loss of a
target n-gram with all n-grams in the generated sequence. EISL draws
inspirations from convolutional networks (ConvNets) which are shift-invariant
to images, hence is robust to the shift of n-grams to tolerate edits in the
target sequences. Moreover, the computation of EISL is essentially a
convolution operation with target n-grams as kernels, which is easy to
implement with existing libraries. To demonstrate the effectiveness of EISL, we
conduct experiments on three tasks: machine translation with noisy target
sequences, unsupervised text style transfer, and non-autoregressive machine
translation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms
cross entropy loss on these three tasks.]]></summary>

large amount of parameters but constant computation cost, and thus it has
become a trend in model scaling. Still it is a mystery how MoE layers bring
quality gains by leveraging the parameters with sparse activation. In this
work, we investigate several key factors in sparse expert models. We observe
that load imbalance may not be a significant problem affecting model quality,
contrary to the perspectives of recent studies, while the number of sparsely
activated experts $k$ and expert capacity $C$ in top-$k$ routing can
significantly make a difference in this context. Furthermore, we take a step
forward to propose a simple method called expert prototyping that splits
experts into different prototypes and applies $k$ top-$1$ routing. This
strategy improves the model quality but maintains constant computational costs,
and our further exploration on extremely large-scale models reflects that it is
more effective in training larger models. We push the model scale to over $1$

surgery is challenging due to reflection on the instruments and frequent
contacts with tissue. Deep neural networks (DNN) show competitive performance
and are in favor in recent years. However, the hunger of DNN for labeled data
poses a huge workload of annotation. Motivated by alleviating this workload, we
propose a general embeddable method to decrease the usage of labeled real
images, using active generated synthetic images. In each active learning
iteration, the most informative unlabeled images are first queried by active
learning and then labeled. Next, synthetic images are generated based on these
selected images. The instruments and backgrounds are cropped out and randomly
combined with each other with blending and fusion near the boundary. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on 2 sinus surgery datasets
and 1 intraabdominal surgery dataset. The results indicate a considerable
improvement in performance, especially when the budget for annotation is small.
The effectiveness of different types of synthetic images, blending methods, and
external background are also studied. All the code is open-sourced at:

on the availability of large datasets with pixel-level labels. The challenges
of collecting such datasets, especially in case of 3D volumes, motivate to
develop approaches that can learn from other types of labels that are cheap to
obtain, e.g. bounding boxes. We focus on 3D medical images with their
corresponding 3D bounding boxes which are considered as series of per-slice
non-tight 2D bounding boxes. While current weakly-supervised approaches that
use 2D bounding boxes as weak labels can be applied to medical image
segmentation, we show that their success is limited in cases when the
assumption about the tightness of the bounding boxes breaks. We propose a new
bounding box correction framework which is trained on a small set of
pixel-level annotations to improve the tightness of a larger set of non-tight
bounding box annotations. The effectiveness of our solution is demonstrated by
evaluating a known weakly-supervised segmentation approach with and without the
proposed bounding box correction algorithm. When the tightness is improved by
our solution, the results of the weakly-supervised segmentation become much
closer to those of the fully-supervised one.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we observe two levels of redundancies when applying vision
transformers (ViT) for image recognition. First, fixing the number of tokens
through the whole network produces redundant features at the spatial level.
Second, the attention maps among different transformer layers are redundant.
Based on the observations above, we propose a PSViT: a ViT with token Pooling
and attention Sharing to reduce the redundancy, effectively enhancing the
feature representation ability, and achieving a better speed-accuracy
trade-off. Specifically, in our PSViT, token pooling can be defined as the
operation that decreases the number of tokens at the spatial level. Besides,
attention sharing will be built between the neighboring transformer layers for
reusing the attention maps having a strong correlation among adjacent layers.
Then, a compact set of the possible combinations for different token pooling
and attention sharing mechanisms are constructed. Based on the proposed compact
set, the number of tokens in each layer and the choices of layers sharing
attention can be treated as hyper-parameters that are learned from data
automatically. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can achieve
up to 6.6% accuracy improvement in ImageNet classification compared with the
DeiT.]]></summary>

to improve NLP systems. However, existing pre-trained models lack of causal

paper, we investigate the problem of injecting causal knowledge into
pre-trained models. There are two fundamental problems: 1) how to collect
various granularities of causal pairs from unstructured texts; 2) how to
effectively inject causal knowledge into pre-trained models. To address these
issues, we extend the idea of CausalBERT from previous studies, and conduct
experiments on various datasets to evaluate its effectiveness. In addition, we
adopt a regularization-based method to preserve the already learned knowledge
with an extra regularization term while injecting causal knowledge. Extensive
experiments on 7 datasets, including four causal pair classification tasks, two
causal QA tasks and a causal inference task, demonstrate that CausalBERT
captures rich causal knowledge and outperforms all pre-trained models-based
state-of-the-art methods, achieving a new causal inference benchmark.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In object re-identification (ReID), the development of deep learning
techniques often involves model update and deployment. It is unbearable to
re-extract image features of the large-scale gallery when deploying new models.
Therefore, backward-compatible representation is proposed to enable the "new"
features compatible with "old"' features, free from the re-extracting process.
The existing backward-compatible methods simply conduct constraints in the
embedding space or discriminative space and ignore the intra-class variance of
the old embeddings, resulting in a risk of damaging the discriminability of new
embeddings.

In this work, we propose a Neighborhood Consensus Contrastive Learning (NCCL)
method, which learns backward-compatible representation from a neighborhood
consensus perspective with both embedding structures and discriminative
knowledge. With NCCL, the new embeddings are aligned and improved with old
embeddings in a multi-cluster view. Besides, we also propose a scheme to filter
the old embeddings with low credibility, which can further improve the
compatibility robustness. Our method ensures backward compatibility without
impairing the accuracy of the new model. And it can even improve the new
model's accuracy in most scenarios.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The capabilities of autonomous flight with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
have significantly increased in recent times. However, basic problems such as
fast and robust geo-localization in GPS-denied environments still remain
unsolved. Existing research has primarily concentrated on improving the
accuracy of localization at the cost of long and varying computation time in
various situations, which often necessitates the use of powerful ground station
machines. In order to make image-based geo-localization online and pragmatic
for lightweight embedded systems on UAVs, we propose a framework that is
reliable in changing scenes, flexible about computing resource allocation and
adaptable to common camera placements. The framework is comprised of two
stages: offline database preparation and online inference. At the first stage,
color images and depth maps are rendered as seen from potential vehicle poses
quantized over the satellite and topography maps of anticipated flying areas. A
database is then populated with the global and local descriptors of the
rendered images. At the second stage, for each captured real-world query image,
top global matches are retrieved from the database and the vehicle pose is
further refined via local descriptor matching. We present field experiments of
image-based localization on two different UAV platforms to validate our
results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[User response prediction, which aims to predict the probability that a user
will provide a predefined positive response in a given context such as clicking
on an ad or purchasing an item, is crucial to many industrial applications such
as online advertising, recommender systems, and search ranking. However, due to
the high dimensionality and super sparsity of the data collected in these
tasks, handcrafting cross features is inevitably time expensive. Prior studies
in predicting user response leveraged the feature interactions by enhancing
feature vectors with products of features to model second-order or high-order
cross features, either explicitly or implicitly. Nevertheless, these existing
methods can be hindered by not learning sufficient cross features due to model
architecture limitations or modeling all high-order feature interactions with
equal weights. This work aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel
architecture Deep Cross Attentional Product Network (DCAP), which keeps cross
network's benefits in modeling high-order feature interactions explicitly at
the vector-wise level. Beyond that, it can differentiate the importance of
different cross features in each network layer inspired by the multi-head
attention mechanism and Product Neural Network (PNN), allowing practitioners to
perform a more in-depth analysis of user behaviors. Additionally, our proposed
model can be easily implemented and train in parallel. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on three real-world datasets. The results have robustly
demonstrated that our proposed model DCAP achieves superior prediction
performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.]]></summary>

However, some languages are under-resourced, e.g., South Asian languages like
Bengali, that lack computational resources for accurate natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper, we propose an explainable approach for hate
speech detection from the under-resourced Bengali language, which we called
DeepHateExplainer. Bengali texts are first comprehensively preprocessed, before
classifying them into political, personal, geopolitical, and religious hates
using a neural ensemble method of transformer-based neural architectures (i.e.,
monolingual Bangla BERT-base, multilingual BERT-cased/uncased, and
XLM-RoBERTa). Important(most and least) terms are then identified using
sensitivity analysis and layer-wise relevance propagation(LRP), before
providing human-interpretable explanations. Finally, we compute
comprehensiveness and sufficiency scores to measure the quality of explanations
w.r.t faithfulness. Evaluations against machine learning~(linear and tree-based
models) and neural networks (i.e., CNN, Bi-LSTM, and Conv-LSTM with word
embeddings) baselines yield F1-scores of 78%, 91%, 89%, and 84%, for political,
personal, geopolitical, and religious hates, respectively, outperforming both
ML and DNN baselines.]]></summary>

retrieving both texts and tables relevant to a question by jointly encoding
texts, tables and questions into a single vector space. To this end, we create
a new multi-modal dataset based on text and table datasets from related work
and compare the retrieval performance of different encoding schemata. We find
that dense vector embeddings of transformer models outperform sparse embeddings

models, tri-encoders, with one encoder for each question, text and table,
increase retrieval performance compared to bi-encoders with one encoder for the

we propose CIRPLANT, a transformer based model that leverages rich pre-trained
vision-and-language (V&L) knowledge for modifying visual features conditioned
on natural language. Retrieval is then done by nearest neighbor lookup on the
modified features. We demonstrate that with a relatively simple architecture,
CIRPLANT outperforms existing methods on open-domain images, while matching

After defining the task of entity stance prediction, we propose a graph-based

representation learning. Our model is then trained with a combination of
supervised, self-supervised and unsupervised loss functions, which are
motivated by multiple social and political phenomenons. We conduct extensive

systems, where the first-stage retrieval is to return a subset of candidate
documents, and latter stages attempt to re-rank those candidates. Unlike
re-ranking stages going through quick technique shifts during past decades, the
first-stage retrieval has long been dominated by classical term-based models.
Unfortunately, these models suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem, which
may block re-ranking stages from relevant documents at the very beginning.
Therefore, it has been a long-term desire to build semantic models for the
first-stage retrieval that can achieve high recall efficiently. Recently, we
have witnessed an explosive growth of research interests on the first-stage
semantic retrieval models. We believe it is the right time to survey current
status, learn from existing methods, and gain some insights for future
development. In this paper, we describe the current landscape of the
first-stage retrieval models under a unified framework to clarify the
connection between classical term-based retrieval methods, early semantic
retrieval methods and neural semantic retrieval methods. Moreover, we identify
some open challenges and envision some future directions, with the hope of

results in numerous natural language processing tasks, still they could not
solve the problem of producing repetitive, dull and sometimes inconsistent text
in open-ended text generation. Studies often attribute this problem to the
maximum likelihood training objective, and propose alternative approaches by
using stochastic decoding methods or altering the training objective. However,
there is still a lack of consistent evaluation metrics to directly compare the
efficacy of these solutions. In this work, we study different evaluation
metrics that have been proposed to evaluate quality, diversity and consistency
of machine-generated text. From there, we propose a practical pipeline to
evaluate language models in open-ended generation task, and research on how to
improve the model's performance in all dimensions by leveraging different

society, and economy. To monitor the pandemic trend, existing studies rely on
the aggregation of traditional statistical models and epidemic spread theory.
In other words, historical statistics of COVID-19, as well as the population
mobility data, become the essential knowledge for monitoring the pandemic
trend. However, these solutions can barely provide precise prediction and
satisfactory explanations on the long-term disease surveillance while the
ubiquitous social media resources can be the key enabler for solving this
problem. For example, serious discussions may occur on social media before and
after some breaking events take place. These events, such as marathon and
parade, may impact the spread of the virus. To take advantage of the social
media data, we propose a novel framework, Social Media enhAnced pandemic
suRveillance Technique (SMART), which is composed of two modules: (i)
information extraction module to construct heterogeneous knowledge graphs based
on the extracted events and relationships among them; (ii) time series
prediction module to provide both short-term and long-term forecasts of the
confirmed cases and fatality at the state-level in the United States and to
discover risk factors for COVID-19 interventions. Extensive experiments show
that our method largely outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by 7.3% and
7.4% in confirmed case/fatality prediction, respectively.]]></summary>

tasks. In the literature, high localization accuracy is achieved with the
mainstream strongly supervised frameworks. However, such methods require
object-level annotations and are unable to detect objects of unknown
categories. Weakly supervised methods face similar difficulties. In this paper,
a self-paced learning framework is proposed to achieve accurate object
localization on the rank list returned by instance search. The proposed
framework mines the target instance gradually from the queries and their
corresponding top-ranked search results. Since a common instance is shared
between the query and the images in the rank list, the target visual instance
can be accurately localized even without knowing what the object category is.
In addition to performing localization on instance search, the issue of
few-shot object detection is also addressed under the same framework. Superior
performance over state-of-the-art methods is observed on both tasks.]]></summary>

a large corpus, as well as predefined persona information. However, in a
real-world setting, neither a large corpus of training data nor persona
information are readily available. To address these practical limitations, we
propose a novel multi-task meta-learning approach which involves training a
model to adapt to new personas without relying on a large corpus, or on any
predefined persona information. Instead, the model is tasked with generating
personalized responses based on only the dialogue context. Unlike prior work,
our approach leverages on the provided persona information only during training
via the introduction of an auxiliary persona reconstruction task. In this
paper, we introduce 2 frameworks that adopt the proposed multi-task
meta-learning approach: the Multi-Task Meta-Learning (MTML) framework, and the
Alternating Multi-Task Meta-Learning (AMTML) framework. Experimental results
show that utilizing MTML and AMTML results in dialogue responses with greater
persona consistency.]]></summary>

physiological signals is an emerging field, and important progress has been
achieved for emotion recognition based on multi-modal signals. However, it is
challenging to make full use of the complementarity among
spatial-spectral-temporal domain features for emotion recognition, as well as
model the heterogeneity and correlation among multi-modal signals. In this
paper, we propose a novel two-stream heterogeneous graph recurrent neural
network, named HetEmotionNet, fusing multi-modal physiological signals for
emotion recognition. Specifically, HetEmotionNet consists of the
spatial-temporal stream and the spatial-spectral stream, which can fuse
spatial-spectral-temporal domain features in a unified framework. Each stream
is composed of the graph transformer network for modeling the heterogeneity,
the graph convolutional network for modeling the correlation, and the gated
recurrent unit for capturing the temporal domain or spectral domain dependency.
Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent studies unveil the vulnerabilities of deep ranking models, where an
imperceptible perturbation can trigger dramatic changes in the ranking result.
While previous attempts focus on manipulating absolute ranks of certain
candidates, the possibility of adjusting their relative order remains
under-explored. In this paper, we formulate a new adversarial attack against
deep ranking systems, i.e., the Order Attack, which covertly alters the
relative order among a selected set of candidates according to an
attacker-specified permutation, with limited interference to other unrelated
candidates. Specifically, it is formulated as a triplet-style loss imposing an
inequality chain reflecting the specified permutation. However, direct
optimization of such white-box objective is infeasible in a real-world attack
scenario due to various black-box limitations. To cope with them, we propose a
Short-range Ranking Correlation metric as a surrogate objective for black-box
Order Attack to approximate the white-box method. The Order Attack is evaluated
on the Fashion-MNIST and Stanford-Online-Products datasets under both white-box
and black-box threat models. The black-box attack is also successfully
implemented on a major e-commerce platform. Comprehensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, revealing a
new type of ranking model vulnerability.]]></summary>

efficiently. Particularly, unsupervised deep hashing is supported by powerful
deep neural networks and has the desirable advantage of label independence. It
is a promising technique for scalable image retrieval. However, deep models
introduce a large number of parameters, which is hard to optimize due to the
lack of explicit semantic labels and brings considerable training cost. As a
result, the retrieval accuracy and training efficiency of existing unsupervised
deep hashing are still limited. To tackle the problems, in this paper, we
propose a simple and efficient \emph{Lightweight Augmented Graph Network
Hashing} (LAGNH) method with a two-pronged strategy. For one thing, we extract
the inner structure of the image as the auxiliary semantics to enhance the
semantic supervision of the unsupervised hash learning process. For another, we
design a lightweight network structure with the assistance of the auxiliary
semantics, which greatly reduces the number of network parameters that needs to
be optimized and thus greatly accelerates the training process. Specifically,
we design a cross-modal attention module based on the auxiliary semantic
information to adaptively mitigate the adverse effects in the deep image
features. Besides, the hash codes are learned by multi-layer message passing
within an adversarial regularized graph convolutional network. Simultaneously,
the semantic representation capability of hash codes is further enhanced by
reconstructing the similarity graph.]]></summary>

we find the parameters required to model user by discrete optimizing over
different measures (like ndcg@5, MRR, ...). We also analyze the result while
considering the same parameters for all users and individual parameters for
each user. Along with it we also analyze the effect on the result while
changing the dataset to model the relationship between tags. Our method also

language models on features from typological databases, by concatenating them
to hidden states or generating weights with hyper-networks. These features

will provide a predefined positive response in a given context such as clicking
on an ad or purchasing an item, is crucial to many industrial applications such
as online advertising, recommender systems, and search ranking. However, due to
the high dimensionality and super sparsity of the data collected in these
tasks, handcrafting cross features is inevitably time expensive. Prior studies
in predicting user response leveraged the feature interactions by enhancing
feature vectors with products of features to model second-order or high-order
cross features, either explicitly or implicitly. Nevertheless, these existing
methods can be hindered by not learning sufficient cross features due to model
architecture limitations or modeling all high-order feature interactions with
equal weights. This work aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel
architecture Deep Cross Attentional Product Network (DCAP), which keeps cross
network's benefits in modeling high-order feature interactions explicitly at
the vector-wise level. Beyond that, it can differentiate the importance of
different cross features in each network layer inspired by the multi-head
attention mechanism and Product Neural Network (PNN), allowing practitioners to
perform a more in-depth analysis of user behaviors. Additionally, our proposed
model can be easily implemented and train in parallel. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on three real-world datasets. The results have robustly
demonstrated that our proposed model DCAP achieves superior prediction
performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.]]></summary>

start and end of each action and its class label has many applications in the
real world. But due to its complexity, researchers have not reached great
results compared to the action recognition task. The complexity is related to
predicting precise start and end times for different actions in any video. In
this paper, we propose a new network based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and
two novel post-processing ideas for TAL task. Specifically, we propose a new
design for the output layer of the GRU resulting in the so-called GRU-Splitted
model. Moreover, linear interpolation is used to generate the action proposals
with precise start and end times. Finally, to rank the generated proposals
appropriately, we use a Learn to Rank (LTR) approach. We evaluated the
performance of the proposed method on Thumos14 dataset. Results show the
superiority of the performance of the proposed method compared to
state-of-the-art. Especially in the mean Average Precision (mAP) metric at

pre-trained Glove embedding. Next, we introduce a transfer learning approach
for hate speech detection using an existing pre-trained language model BERT

(Distilled version of BERT) and GPT-2 (Generative Pre-Training). We perform
hyper parameters tuning analysis of our best model (BI-LSTM) considering
different neural network architectures, learn-ratings and normalization methods
etc. After tuning the model and with the best combination of parameters, we
achieve over 92 percent accuracy upon evaluating it on test data. We also
create a class module which contains main functionality including text

increase retrieval performance compared to bi-encoders with one encoder for the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the current deep learning based recommendation system, the embedding
method is generally employed to complete the conversion from the
high-dimensional sparse feature vector to the low-dimensional dense feature
vector. However, as the dimension of the input vector of the embedding layer is
too large, the addition of the embedding layer significantly slows down the
convergence speed of the entire neural network, which is not acceptable in
real-world scenarios. In addition, as the interaction between users and items
increases and the relationship between items becomes more complicated, the
embedding method proposed for sequence data is no longer suitable for graphic
data in the current real environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the
Dual-modal Graph Embedding Method (DGEM) to solve these problems. DGEM includes
two modes, static and dynamic. We first construct the item graph to extract the
graph structure and use random walk of unequal probability to capture the
high-order proximity between the items. Then we generate the graph embedding
vector through the Skip-Gram model, and finally feed the downstream deep neural
network for the recommendation task. The experimental results show that DGEM
can mine the high-order proximity between items and enhance the expression
ability of the recommendation model. Meanwhile it also improves the
recommendation performance by utilizing the time dependent relationship between
items.]]></summary>

we propose CIRPLANT, a transformer based model that leverages rich pre-trained

on natural language. Retrieval is then done by nearest neighbor lookup on the
modified features. We demonstrate that with a relatively simple architecture,
CIRPLANT outperforms existing methods on open-domain images, while matching

under-specified queries, such as those that are ambiguous or multi-faceted.
Existing approaches often rely on massive query logs and interaction data to
generate a variety of possible query intents, which then can be used to re-rank
documents. However, relying on user interaction data is problematic because one
first needs a massive user base to build a sufficient log; public query logs
are insufficient on their own. Given the recent success of causal language
models (such as the Text-To-Text Transformer (T5) model) at text generation
tasks, we explore the capacity of these models to generate potential query
intents. We find that to encourage diversity in the generated queries, it is
beneficial to adapt the model by including a new Distributional Causal Language
Modeling (DCLM) objective during fine-tuning and a representation replacement
during inference. Across six standard evaluation benchmarks, we find that our
method (which we call IntenT5) improves search result diversity and attains
(and sometimes exceeds) the diversity obtained when using query suggestions
based on a proprietary query log. Our analysis shows that our approach is most
effective for multi-faceted queries and is able to generalize effectively to
queries that were unseen in training data.]]></summary>

ResNeXt-101 image encoder with the category embedding using wideResNet-50 with
word2vec. The second tier modality alignment optimizes the textual-visual joint

cross-modality alignments as the auxiliary loss regularizations to further
reduce the alignment errors in the joint learning of the two modality-specific
embedding functions. The category-based cross-modal alignment aims to align the
image category with the recipe category as a loss regularization to the joint
embedding. The cross-modal discriminator-based alignment aims to add the
visual-textual embedding distribution alignment to further regularize the joint

outperforms the retrieval on the document-level. Furthermore the experiments
suggest that dense retrieval methods outperform lexical retrieval. For
re-ranking we address the problem of long documents by summarizing the cases

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Numerous neural retrieval models have been proposed in recent years. These
models learn to compute a ranking score between the given query and document.
The majority of existing models are trained in pairwise fashion using
human-judged labels directly without further calibration. The traditional
pairwise schemes can be time-consuming and require pre-defined
positive-negative document pairs for training, potentially leading to learning
bias due to document distribution mismatch between training and test
conditions. Some popular existing listwise schemes rely on the strong
pre-defined probabilistic assumptions and stark difference between relevant and
non-relevant documents for the given query, which may limit the model potential
due to the low-quality or ambiguous relevance labels. To address these
concerns, we turn to a physics-inspired ranking balance scheme and propose
PoolRank, a pooling-based listwise learning framework. The proposed scheme has
four major advantages: (1) PoolRank extracts training information from the best
candidates at the local level based on model performance and relative ranking
among abundant document candidates. (2) By combining four pooling-based loss
components in a multi-task learning fashion, PoolRank calibrates the ranking
balance for the partially relevant and the highly non-relevant documents
automatically without costly human inspection. (3) PoolRank can be easily
generalized to any neural retrieval model without requiring additional
learnable parameters or model structure modifications. (4) Compared to pairwise
learning and existing listwise learning schemes, PoolRank yields better ranking
performance for all studied retrieval models while retaining efficient
convergence rates.]]></summary>

there is a limited number of systematic surveys on CDR, especially regarding
the latest proposed methods as well as the recommendation scenarios and
recommendation tasks they address. In this survey paper, we first proposed a
two-level taxonomy of cross-domain recommendation which classifies different
recommendation scenarios and recommendation tasks. We then introduce and
summarize existing cross-domain recommendation approaches under different
recommendation scenarios in a structured manner. We also organize datasets
commonly used. We conclude this survey by providing several potential research

suppliers are not equally represented in the recommendation results. This is
especially problematic when bias is amplified over time as a few popular items
are repeatedly over-represented in recommendation lists. This phenomenon can be
viewed as a recommendation feedback loop: the system repeatedly recommends
certain items at different time points and interactions of users with those
items will amplify bias towards those items over time. This issue has been
extensively studied in the literature on model-based or neighborhood-based
recommendation algorithms, but less work has been done on online recommendation
models such as those based on multi-armed Bandit algorithms. In this paper, we
study exposure bias in a class of well-known bandit algorithms known as Linear
Cascade Bandits. We analyze these algorithms on their ability to handle
exposure bias and provide a fair representation for items and suppliers in the
recommendation results. Our analysis reveals that these algorithms fail to
treat items and suppliers fairly and do not sufficiently explore the item space
for each user. To mitigate this bias, we propose a discounting factor and
incorporate it into these algorithms that controls the exposure of items at
each time step. To show the effectiveness of the proposed discounting factor on
mitigating exposure bias, we perform experiments on two datasets using three
cascading bandit algorithms and our experimental results show that the proposed
method improves the exposure fairness for items and suppliers.]]></summary>

Even information retrieval has not been immune to the charm of the transformer,

there has been much work in streamlining, caching, and modifying transformer
architectures for production, here we explore a new direction: distilling a

efficiently cached and queried. We argue from a probabilistic perspective that
sequence-to-sequence models are a conceptually ideal---albeit highly
impractical---retriever. We derive a new distillation objective, implementing
it as a data augmentation scheme. Using natural language source code search as

fundamental drive that explains and predicts why people do what they do,

leverage such goals to assist people's browsing activities. This paper proposes
to take a new approach to address this problem, which is fulfilled through a

psychologically-sound taxonomy of higher-ordered goals and learn to build their
representations in a structure-preserving manner. Then we incorporate the
resulting representations for enhancing the experiences of common activities
people perform on the web. Experiments on large-scale data from Microsoft Edge
web browser show that GoWeB significantly outperforms competitive baselines for
in-session web page recommendation, re-visitation classification, and
goal-based web page grouping. A follow-up analysis further characterizes how
the variety of human motives can affect the difference observed in human

downbeat positions, and meter, is critical for many real-time music
applications. Musical rhythm comprises complex hierarchical relationships
across time, rendering its analysis intrinsically challenging and at times
subjective. Furthermore, systems which attempt to estimate rhythmic information
in real-time must be causal and must produce estimates quickly and efficiently.
In this work, we introduce an online system for joint beat, downbeat, and meter
tracking, which utilizes causal convolutional and recurrent layers, followed by
a pair of sequential Monte Carlo particle filters applied during inference. The
proposed system does not need to be primed with a time signature in order to
perform downbeat tracking, and is instead able to estimate meter and adjust the
predictions over time. Additionally, we propose an information gate strategy to
significantly decrease the computational cost of particle filtering during the
inference step, making the system much faster than previous sampling-based
methods. Experiments on the GTZAN dataset, which is unseen during training,
show that the system outperforms various online beat and downbeat tracking
systems and achieves comparable performance to a baseline offline joint method.]]></summary>

applications, some of which are safety critical. Unfortunately, DNNs are known
to be vulnerable to so-called adversarial attacks that manipulate inputs to
cause incorrect results that can be beneficial to an attacker or damaging to
the victim. Multiple defenses have been proposed to increase the robustness of
DNNs. In general, these defenses have high overhead, some require
attack-specific re-training of the model or careful tuning to adapt to
different attacks.

This paper presents HASI, a hardware-accelerated defense that uses a process
we call stochastic inference to detect adversarial inputs. We show that by
carefully injecting noise into the model at inference time, we can
differentiate adversarial inputs from benign ones. HASI uses the output
distribution characteristics of noisy inference compared to a non-noisy
reference to detect adversarial inputs. We show an adversarial detection rate
of 86% when applied to VGG16 and 93% when applied to ResNet50, which exceeds
the detection rate of the state of the art approaches, with a much lower
overhead. We demonstrate two software/hardware-accelerated co-designs, which
reduces the performance impact of stochastic inference to 1.58X-2X relative to
the unprotected baseline, compared to 15X-20X overhead for a software-only GPU
implementation.]]></summary>

Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings are essential for
maintaining occupant comfort and reducing energy consumption. These HVAC
systems in smart buildings rely on real-time sensor readings, which in practice
often suffer from various faults and could also be vulnerable to malicious
attacks. Such faulty sensor inputs may lead to the violation of indoor
environment requirements (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) and the increase
of energy consumption. While many model-based approaches have been proposed in
the literature for building HVAC control, it is costly to develop accurate
physical models for ensuring their performance and even more challenging to
address the impact of sensor faults. In this work, we present a novel
learning-based framework for sensor fault-tolerant HVAC control, which includes
three deep learning based components for 1) generating temperature proposals
with the consideration of possible sensor faults, 2) selecting one of the
proposals based on the assessment of their accuracy, and 3) applying
reinforcement learning with the selected temperature proposal. Moreover, to
address the challenge of training data insufficiency in building-related tasks,
we propose a model-assisted learning method leveraging an abstract model of
building physical dynamics. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
the proposed fault-tolerant HVAC control framework can significantly reduce
building temperature violations under a variety of sensor fault patterns while

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A basic requirement for a mathematical model is often that its solution
(output) shouldn't change much if the model's parameters (input) are perturbed.
This is important because the exact values of parameters may not be known and
one would like to avoid being mislead by an output obtained using incorrect
values. Thus, it's rarely enough to address an application by formulating a
model, solving the resulting optimization problem and presenting the solution
as the answer. One would need to confirm that the model is suitable, i.e.,
"good," and this can, at least in part, be achieved by considering a family of
optimization problems constructed by perturbing parameters of concern. The
resulting sensitivity analysis uncovers troubling situations with unstable
solutions, which we referred to as "bad" models, and indicates better model
formulations. Embedding an actual problem of interest within a family of
problems is also a primary path to optimality conditions as well as
computationally attractive, alternative problems, which under ideal
circumstances, and when properly tuned, may even furnish the minimum value of
the actual problem. The tuning of these alternative problems turns out to be
intimately tied to finding multipliers in optimality conditions and thus
emerges as a main component of several optimization algorithms. In fact, the
tuning amounts to solving certain dual optimization problems. In this tutorial,
we'll discuss the opportunities and insights afforded by this broad
perspective.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In CS literature, the efforts can be divided into two groups: finding a
measurement matrix that preserves the compressed information at the maximum
level, and finding a reconstruction algorithm for the compressed information.
In the traditional CS setup, the measurement matrices are selected as random
matrices, and optimization-based iterative solutions are used to recover the
signals. However, when we handle large signals, using random matrices become
cumbersome especially when it comes to iterative optimization-based solutions.
Even though recent deep learning-based solutions boost the reconstruction
accuracy performance while speeding up the recovery, still jointly learning the
whole measurement matrix is a difficult process. In this work, we introduce a
separable multi-linear learning of the CS matrix by representing it as the
summation of arbitrary number of tensors. For a special case where the CS
operation is set as a single tensor multiplication, the model is reduced to the
learning-based separable CS; while a dense CS matrix can be approximated and
learned as the summation of multiple tensors. Both cases can be used in CS of
two or multi-dimensional signals e.g., images, multi-spectral images, videos,
etc. Structural CS matrices can also be easily approximated and learned in our
multi-linear separable learning setup with structural tensor sum
representation. Hence, our learnable generalized tensor summation CS operation
encapsulates most CS setups including separable CS, non-separable CS
(traditional vector-matrix multiplication), structural CS, and CS of the
multi-dimensional signals. For both gray-scale and RGB images, the proposed
scheme surpasses most state-of-the-art solutions, especially in lower
measurement rates. Although the performance gain remains limited from tensor to
the sum of tensor representation for gray-scale images, it becomes significant

valuable unlabeled data points from a large pool. Traditional AL frameworks
have two limitations: First, they perform data selection in a multi-round
manner, which is time-consuming and impractical. Second, they usually assume
that there are a small amount of labeled data points available in the same
domain as the data in the unlabeled pool. Recent work proposes a solution for
one-round active learning based on data utility learning and optimization,
which fixes the first issue but still requires the initially labeled data
points in the same domain. In this paper, we propose $\mathrm{D^2ULO}$ as a
solution that solves both issues. Specifically, $\mathrm{D^2ULO}$ leverages the
idea of domain adaptation (DA) to train a data utility model which can
effectively predict the utility for any given unlabeled data in the target
domain once labeled. The trained data utility model can then be used to select
high-utility data and at the same time, provide an estimate for the utility of
the selected data. Our algorithm does not rely on any feedback from annotators
in the target domain and hence, can be used to perform zero-round active
learning or warm-start existing multi-round active learning strategies. Our
experiments show that $\mathrm{D^2ULO}$ outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art AL strategies equipped with domain adaptation over various
domain shift settings (e.g., real-to-real data and synthetic-to-real data).
Particularly, $\mathrm{D^2ULO}$ is applicable to the scenario where source and
target labels have mismatches, which is not supported by the existing works.]]></summary>

of machine learning such as decision making, it is therefore very difficult to
establish clear and direct objectives for training representation learning
models. It has been argued that a good representation should disentangle the
underlying variation factors, yet how to translate this into training
objectives remains unknown. This paper presents an attempt to establish direct
training criterions and design principles for developing good representation
learning models. We propose that a good representation learning model should be
maximally expressive, i.e., capable of distinguishing the maximum number of
input configurations. We formally define expressiveness and introduce the
maximum expressiveness (MEXS) theorem of a general learning model. We propose
to train a model by maximizing its expressiveness while at the same time
incorporating general priors such as model smoothness. We present a conscience
competitive learning algorithm which encourages the model to reach its MEXS
whilst at the same time adheres to model smoothness prior. We also introduce a
label consistent training (LCT) technique to boost model smoothness by
encouraging it to assign consistent labels to similar samples. We present
extensive experimental results to show that our method can indeed design
representation learning models capable of developing representations that are
as good as or better than state of the art. We also show that our technique is
computationally efficient, robust against different parameter settings and can
work effectively on a variety of datasets. Code available at

varying excitation source. Therefore, the information present in a speech such

excitation source and vocal tract system. However, there is very less
utilization of excitation source features to recognize emotion. In our earlier

instantaneous pitch, phase and strength of epochs for discriminating emotions.
We have combined the excitation source features and the well known
Male-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features to develop an emotion
recognition system with improved performance. DNN-HMM speaker adaptive models
have been developed using MFCC, epoch and combined features. IEMOCAP emotional
database has been used to evaluate the models. The average accuracy for emotion
recognition system when using MFCC and epoch features separately is 59.25% and
54.52% respectively. The recognition performance improves to 64.2% when MFCC

more high-stakes, tools for explaining model predictions have become
increasingly important. This has spurred a flurry of research in model
explainability and has given rise to feature attribution methods such as LIME
and SHAP. Despite their widespread use, evaluating and comparing different
feature attribution methods remains challenging: evaluations ideally require
human studies, and empirical evaluation metrics are often data-intensive or
computationally prohibitive on real-world datasets. In this work, we address
this issue by releasing XAI-Bench: a suite of synthetic datasets along with a
library for benchmarking feature attribution algorithms. Unlike real-world
datasets, synthetic datasets allow the efficient computation of conditional
expected values that are needed to evaluate ground-truth Shapley values and
other metrics. The synthetic datasets we release offer a wide variety of
parameters that can be configured to simulate real-world data. We demonstrate
the power of our library by benchmarking popular explainability techniques
across several evaluation metrics and across a variety of settings. The
versatility and efficiency of our library will help researchers bring their

solution of a contemporary problem related to the security of maritime domains.
The worldwide ``Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated'' (IUU) fishing incidents
have led to serious environmental and economic consequences which involve
drastic changes in our ecosystems in addition to financial losses caused by the
depletion of natural resources. The Fisheries and Aquatic Department (FAD) of
the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) issued a report
which indicated that the annual losses due to IUU fishing reached $25 Billion.
This imposes negative impacts on the future-biodiversity of the marine
ecosystem and domestic Gross National Product (GNP). Hence, robust interception
mechanisms are increasingly needed for detecting and pursuing the unrelenting
illegal fishing incidents in maritime territories. This article addresses the
problem of coordinating the motion of a fleet of marine vessels (pursuers) to
catch an IUU vessel while still in local waters. The problem is formulated as a
pursuer-evader problem that is tackled within an ML framework. One or more
pursuers, such as law enforcement vessels, intercept an evader (i.e., the
illegal fishing ship) using an online reinforcement learning mechanism that is
based on a value iteration process. It employs real-time navigation
measurements of the evader ship as well as those of the pursuing vessels and
returns back model-free interception strategies.]]></summary>

subject to various kinds of noise. Random and correlated fluctuations and
heterogeneities can be present in a two-time correlation function and obscure

addressing the disparate origins of noise in the experimental data is
challenging. We propose a computational approach for improving the
signal-to-noise ratio in two-time correlation functions that is based on
Convolutional Neural Network Encoder-Decoder (CNN-ED) models. Such models
extract features from an image via convolutional layers, project them to a low
dimensional space and then reconstruct a clean image from this reduced
representation via transposed convolutional layers. Not only are ED models a
general tool for random noise removal, but their application to low
signal-to-noise data can enhance the data quantitative usage since they are
able to learn the functional form of the signal. We demonstrate that the CNN-ED

summarization, a key problem is searching over a large space of possible output
sequences. We propose to learn representations of the outputs that are
specifically meant for search: rich enough to specify the desired output but
compact enough to make search more efficient. Discrete latent codes are
appealing for this purpose, as they naturally allow sophisticated combinatorial
search strategies. The latent codes are learned using a self-supervised
learning principle, in which first a discrete autoencoder is trained on the
output sequences, and then the resulting latent codes are used as intermediate
targets for the end-to-end sequence prediction task. Based on these insights,
we introduce the \emph{Latent Programmer}, a program synthesis method that
first predicts a discrete latent code from input/output examples, and then
generates the program in the target language. We evaluate the Latent Programmer
on two domains: synthesis of string transformation programs, and generation of
programs from natural language descriptions. We demonstrate that the discrete

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In distributed optimization problems, a technique called gradient coding,
which involves replicating data points, has been used to mitigate the effect of
straggling machines. Recent work has studied approximate gradient coding, which
concerns coding schemes where the replication factor of the data is too low to
recover the full gradient exactly. Our work is motivated by the challenge of
creating approximate gradient coding schemes that simultaneously work well in
both the adversarial and stochastic models. To that end, we introduce novel
approximate gradient codes based on expander graphs, in which each machine
receives exactly two blocks of data points. We analyze the decoding error both
in the random and adversarial straggler setting, when optimal decoding
coefficients are used. We show that in the random setting, our schemes achieve
an error to the gradient that decays exponentially in the replication factor.
In the adversarial setting, the error is nearly a factor of two smaller than
any existing code with similar performance in the random setting. We show
convergence bounds both in the random and adversarial setting for gradient
descent under standard assumptions using our codes. In the random setting, our
convergence rate improves upon block-box bounds. In the adversarial setting, we
show that gradient descent can converge down to a noise floor that scales
linearly with the adversarial error to the gradient. We demonstrate empirically
that our schemes achieve near-optimal error in the random setting and converge
faster than algorithms which do not use the optimal decoding coefficients.]]></summary>

algorithm when it employs off-policy learning, function approximation, and
bootstrapping simultaneously. In this paper, we investigate the target network
as a tool for breaking the deadly triad, providing theoretical support for the
conventional wisdom that a target network stabilizes training. We first propose
and analyze a novel target network update rule which augments the commonly used
Polyak-averaging style update with two projections. We then apply the target
network and ridge regularization in several divergent algorithms and show their
convergence to regularized TD fixed points. Those algorithms are off-policy
with linear function approximation and bootstrapping, spanning both policy
evaluation and control, as well as both discounted and average-reward settings.
In particular, we provide the first convergent linear $Q$-learning algorithms
under nonrestrictive and changing behavior policies without bi-level

better reflects the underlying geometric structure. Dynamic resource allocation
is formulated as multi-agent reinforcement learning, whose action-value

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Random reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) digital rocks from
two-dimensional (2D) slices is crucial for elucidating the microstructure of
rocks and its effects on pore-scale flow in terms of numerical modeling, since
massive samples are usually required to handle intrinsic uncertainties. Despite
remarkable advances achieved by traditional process-based methods, statistical
approaches and recently famous deep learning-based models, few works have
focused on producing several kinds of rocks with one trained model and allowing
the reconstructed samples to satisfy certain given properties, such as
porosity. To fill this gap, we propose a new framework, named RockGPT, which is
composed of VQ-VAE and conditional GPT, to synthesize 3D samples based on a
single 2D slice from the perspective of video generation. The VQ-VAE is
utilized to compress high-dimensional input video, i.e., the sequence of
continuous rock slices, to discrete latent codes and reconstruct them. In order
to obtain diverse reconstructions, the discrete latent codes are modeled using
conditional GPT in an autoregressive manner, while incorporating conditional
information from a given slice, rock type, and porosity. We conduct two
experiments on five kinds of rocks, and the results demonstrate that RockGPT
can produce different kinds of rocks with the same model, and the reconstructed
samples can successfully meet certain specified porosities. In a broader sense,
through leveraging the proposed conditioning scheme, RockGPT constitutes an
effective way to build a general model to produce multiple kinds of rocks
simultaneously that also satisfy user-defined properties.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Model-free techniques, such as machine learning (ML), have recently attracted
much interest towards the physical layer design, e.g., symbol detection,
channel estimation, and beamforming. Most of these ML techniques employ
centralized learning (CL) schemes and assume the availability of datasets at a
parameter server (PS), demanding the transmission of data from edge devices,
such as mobile phones, to the PS. Exploiting the data generated at the edge,
federated learning (FL) has been proposed recently as a distributed learning
scheme, in which each device computes the model parameters and sends them to
the PS for model aggregation while the datasets are kept intact at the edge.
Thus, FL is more communication-efficient and privacy-preserving than CL and
applicable to the wireless communication scenarios, wherein the data are
generated at the edge devices. This article presents the recent advances in
FL-based training for physical layer design problems. Compared to CL, the
effectiveness of FL is presented in terms of communication overhead with a
slight performance loss in the learning accuracy. The design challenges, such
as model, data, and hardware complexity, are also discussed in detail along
with possible solutions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adversarial robustness of deep learning models has gained much traction in
the last few years. Various attacks and defenses are proposed to improve the
adversarial robustness of modern-day deep learning architectures. While all
these approaches help improve the robustness, one promising direction for
improving adversarial robustness is un-explored, i.e., the complex topology of
the neural network architecture. In this work, we answer the following
question: "Can the complex topology of a neural network give adversarial
robustness without any form of adversarial training?" empirically by
experimenting with different hand-crafted and NAS based architectures. Our
findings show that, for small-scale attacks, NAS-based architectures are more
robust for small-scale datasets and simple tasks than hand-crafted
architectures. However, as the dataset's size or the task's complexity
increase, hand-crafted architectures are more robust than NAS-based
architectures. We perform the first large scale study to understand adversarial
robustness purely from an architectural perspective. Our results show that
random sampling in the search space of DARTS (a popular NAS method) with simple
ensembling can improve the robustness to PGD attack by nearly ~12\%. We show
that NAS, which is popular for SoTA accuracy, can provide adversarial accuracy
as a free add-on without any form of adversarial training. Our results show
that leveraging the power of neural network topology with methods like
ensembles can be an excellent way to achieve adversarial robustness without any
form of adversarial training. We also introduce a metric that can be used to
calculate the trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness.]]></summary>

models has long been an important research problem. Its importance has further
increased recently due to the growing need for large-scale datasets to train
deep learning models. Weak or noisy supervision could originate from multiple
sources including non-expert annotators or automatic labeling based on
heuristics or user interaction signals. There is an extensive amount of
previous work focusing on leveraging noisy labels. Most notably, recent work
has shown impressive gains by using a meta-learned instance re-weighting
approach where a meta-learning framework is used to assign instance weights to
noisy labels. In this paper, we extend this approach via posing the problem as
label correction problem within a meta-learning framework. We view the label
correction procedure as a meta-process and propose a new meta-learning based
framework termed MLC (Meta Label Correction) for learning with noisy labels.
Specifically, a label correction network is adopted as a meta-model to produce
corrected labels for noisy labels while the main model is trained to leverage
the corrected labeled. Both models are jointly trained by solving a bi-level
optimization problem. We run extensive experiments with different label noise
levels and types on both image recognition and text classification tasks. We
compare the reweighing and correction approaches showing that the correction
framing addresses some of the limitation of reweighting. We also show that the
proposed MLC approach achieves large improvements over previous methods in many
settings.]]></summary>

theories behind the models. The linear model is the main technique in
regression problems and the primary tool for it is the least squares
approximation which minimizes a sum of squared errors. This is a natural choice
when we're interested in finding the regression function which minimizes the
corresponding expected squared error. This survey is primarily a summary of
purpose, significance of important theories behind linear models, e.g.,
distribution theory, minimum variance estimator. We first describe ordinary
least squares from three different points of view upon which we disturb the
model with random noise and Gaussian noise. By Gaussian noise, the model gives
rise to the likelihood so that we introduce a maximum likelihood estimator. It
also develops some distribution theories via this Gaussian disturbance. The
distribution theory of least squares will help us answer various questions and
introduce related applications. We then prove least squares is the best
unbiased linear model in the sense of mean squared error and most importantly,
it actually approaches the theoretical limit. We end up with linear models with
the Bayesian approach and beyond.]]></summary>

isolation plan to prevent its spread. Recently, transfer learning has been used
for Covid-19 detection using X-ray, ultrasound, and CT scans. One of the major
limitations inherent to these proposed methods is limited labeled dataset size
that affects the reliability of Covid-19 diagnosis and disease progression. In
this work, we demonstrate that how we can augment limited X-ray images data by
using Contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) to train the
last layer of the pre-trained deep learning models to mitigate the bias of
transfer learning for Covid-19 detection. We transfer learned various
pre-trained deep learning models including AlexNet, ZFNet, VGG-16, ResNet-18,
and GoogLeNet, and fine-tune the last layer by using CLAHE-augmented dataset.
The experiment results reveal that the CLAHE-based augmentation to various
pre-trained deep learning models significantly improves the model efficiency.
The pre-trained VCG-16 model with CLAHEbased augmented images achieves a
sensitivity of 95% using 15 epochs. AlexNet works show good sensitivity when
trained on non-augmented data. Other models demonstrate a value of less than
60% when trained on non-augmented data. Our results reveal that the sample bias
can negatively impact the performance of transfer learning which is
significantly improved by using CLAHE-based augmentation.]]></summary>

by relying on the contrastive learning paradigm, which learns representations
by pushing positive pairs, or similar examples from the same class, closer
together while keeping negative pairs far apart. Despite the empirical
successes, theoretical foundations are limited -- prior analyses assume
conditional independence of the positive pairs given the same class label, but
recent empirical applications use heavily correlated positive pairs (i.e., data
augmentations of the same image). Our work analyzes contrastive learning
without assuming conditional independence of positive pairs using a novel
concept of the augmentation graph on data. Edges in this graph connect
augmentations of the same data, and ground-truth classes naturally form
connected sub-graphs. We propose a loss that performs spectral decomposition on
the population augmentation graph and can be succinctly written as a
contrastive learning objective on neural net representations. Minimizing this
objective leads to features with provable accuracy guarantees under linear
probe evaluation. By standard generalization bounds, these accuracy guarantees
also hold when minimizing the training contrastive loss. Empirically, the
features learned by our objective can match or outperform several strong
baselines on benchmark vision datasets. In all, this work provides the first
provable analysis for contrastive learning where guarantees for linear probe
evaluation can apply to realistic empirical settings.]]></summary>

graph. Recent progress on node embedding shows that proximity matrix
factorization methods gain superb performance and scale to large graphs with
millions of nodes. Existing approaches first define a proximity matrix and then
learn the embeddings that fit the proximity by matrix factorization. Most
existing matrix factorization methods adopt the same proximity for different
tasks, while it is observed that different tasks and datasets may require
different proximity, limiting their representation power.

Motivated by this, we propose {\em Lemane}, a framework with trainable
proximity measures, which can be learned to best suit the datasets and tasks at
hand automatically. Our method is end-to-end, which incorporates differentiable
SVD in the pipeline so that the parameters can be trained via backpropagation.
However, this learning process is still expensive on large graphs. To improve
the scalability, we train proximity measures only on carefully subsampled
graphs, and then apply standard proximity matrix factorization on the original
graph using the learned proximity. Note that, computing the learned proximities
for each pair is still expensive for large graphs, and existing techniques for
computing proximities are not applicable to the learned proximities. Thus, we
present generalized push techniques to make our solution scalable to large
graphs with millions of nodes. Extensive experiments show that our proposed
solution outperforms existing solutions on both link prediction and node
classification tasks on almost all datasets.]]></summary>

medical image analysis tasks such as segmentation. Post-processing and refining
the results of segmentation is a common practice to decrease the
misclassifications originating from the segmentation network. In addition to
widely used methods like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) which focus on the
structure of the segmented volume/area, a graph-based recent approach makes use
of certain and uncertain points in a graph and refines the segmentation
according to a small graph convolutional network (GCN). However, there are two
drawbacks of the approach: most of the edges in the graph are assigned randomly
and the GCN is trained independently from the segmentation network. To address
these issues, we define a new neighbor-selection mechanism according to feature
distances and combine the two networks in the training procedure. According to
the experimental results on pancreas segmentation from Computed Tomography (CT)
images, we demonstrate improvement in the quantitative measures. Also,
examining the dynamic neighbors created by our method, edges between
semantically similar image parts are observed. The proposed method also shows
qualitative enhancements in the segmentation maps, as demonstrated in the

and plays a key role in supplying the whole body with blood. Aortic diseases,
like aneurysms or dissections, can lead to an aortic rupture, whose treatment
with open surgery is highly risky. Therefore, patients commonly undergo drug
treatment under constant monitoring, which requires regular inspections of the
vessels through imaging. The standard imaging modality for diagnosis and
monitoring is computed tomography (CT), which can provide a detailed picture of
the aorta and its branching vessels if combined with a contrast agent,
resulting in a CT angiography (CTA). Optimally, the whole aortic vessel tree
geometry from consecutive CTAs, are overlaid and compared. This allows to not
only detect changes in the aorta, but also more peripheral vessel tree changes,
caused by the primary pathology or newly developed. When performed manually,
this reconstruction requires slice by slice contouring, which could easily take
a whole day for a single aortic vessel tree and, hence, is not feasible in
clinical practice. Automatic or semi-automatic vessel tree segmentation
algorithms, on the other hand, can complete this task in a fraction of the
manual execution time and run in parallel to the clinical routine of the
clinicians. In this paper, we systematically review computing techniques for
the automatic and semi-automatic segmentation of the aortic vessel tree. The
review concludes with an in-depth discussion on how close these
state-of-the-art approaches are to an application in clinical practice and how
active this research field is, taking into account the number of publications,
datasets and challenges.]]></summary>

subjects, the main difference being that the former is data driven: how to
assign to quantum states $\rho(x)$ the corresponding class $c$ (or hypothesis)
is learnt from examples during training, where $x$ can be either tunable
experimental parameters or classical data "embedded" into quantum states. Does
the model generalize? This is the main question in any data-driven strategy,
namely the ability to predict the correct class even of previously unseen
states. Here we establish a link between quantum machine learning
classification and quantum hypothesis testing (state and channel
discrimination) and then show that the accuracy and generalization capability
of quantum classifiers depend on the (R\'enyi) mutual informations $I(C{:}Q)$
and $I_2(X{:}Q)$ between the quantum state space $Q$ and the classical
parameter space $X$ or class space $C$. Based on the above characterization, we
then show how different properties of $Q$ affect classification accuracy and
generalization, such as the dimension of the Hilbert space, the amount of
noise, and the amount of neglected information from $X$ via, e.g., pooling
layers. Moreover, we introduce a quantum version of the Information Bottleneck
principle that allows us to explore the various tradeoffs between accuracy and
generalization. Finally, in order to check our theoretical predictions, we
study the classification of the quantum phases of an Ising spin chain, and we
propose the Variational Quantum Information Bottleneck (VQIB) method to
optimize quantum embeddings of classical data to favor generalization.]]></summary>

diseases. As COVID-19 is highly contagious, early diagnosis of COVID-19 is
crucial for an effective treatment strategy. However, the RT-PCR test which is
considered to be a gold standard in the diagnosis of COVID-19 suffers from a
high false-negative rate. Chest X-ray (CXR) image analysis has emerged as a
feasible and effective diagnostic technique towards this objective. In this
work, we propose the COVID-19 classification problem as a three-class
classification problem to distinguish between COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia
classes. We propose a three-stage framework, named COV-ELM. Stage one deals
with preprocessing and transformation while stage two deals with feature
extraction. These extracted features are passed as an input to the ELM at the
third stage, resulting in the identification of COVID-19. The choice of ELM in
this work has been motivated by its faster convergence, better generalization
capability, and shorter training time in comparison to the conventional
gradient-based learning algorithms. As bigger and diverse datasets become
available, ELM can be quickly retrained as compared to its gradient-based
competitor models. The proposed model achieved a macro average F1-score of 0.95
and the overall sensitivity of ${0.94 \pm 0.02} at a 95% confidence interval.
When compared to state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, the COV-ELM is
found to outperform its competitors in this three-class classification
scenario. Further, LIME has been integrated with the proposed COV-ELM model to
generate annotated CXR images. The annotations are based on the superpixels
that have contributed to distinguish between the different classes. It was
observed that the superpixels correspond to the regions of the human lungs that
are clinically observed in COVID-19 and Pneumonia cases.]]></summary>

problem scenarios, it is often desired to improve beyond the structure of such
solutions and surpass their limitations. To this end, residual policy learning
(RPL) offers a formulation to improve existing controllers with reinforcement
learning (RL) by learning an additive "residual" to the output of a given
controller. However, the applicability of such an approach highly depends on
the structure of the controller. Often, internal feedback signals of the
controller limit an RL algorithm to adequately change the policy and, hence,
learn the task. We propose a new formulation that addresses these limitations
by also modifying the feedback signals to the controller with an RL policy and
show superior performance of our approach on a contact-rich peg-insertion task
under position and orientation uncertainty. In addition, we use a recent
Cartesian impedance control architecture as the control framework which can be
available to us as a black-box while assuming no knowledge about its
input/output structure, and show the difficulties of standard RPL. Furthermore,
we introduce an adaptive curriculum for the given task to gradually increase
the task difficulty in terms of position and orientation uncertainty. A video

actors who optimize for their individual objectives. Moreover, real-world
policies should be explainable and robust to simulation-to-reality gaps, e.g.,
due to calibration issues. Existing approaches are often limited to a narrow
set of policy levers or objectives that are hard to measure, do not yield
explicit optimal policies, or do not consider strategic behavior, for example.
Hence, it remains challenging to optimize policy in real-world scenarios. Here
we show that the AI Economist framework enables effective, flexible, and
interpretable policy design using two-level reinforcement learning (RL) and
data-driven simulations. We validate our framework on optimizing the stringency
of US state policies and Federal subsidies during a pandemic, e.g., COVID-19,
using a simulation fitted to real data. We find that log-linear policies
trained using RL significantly improve social welfare, based on both public
health and economic outcomes, compared to past outcomes. Their behavior can be
explained, e.g., well-performing policies respond strongly to changes in
recovery and vaccination rates. They are also robust to calibration errors,
e.g., infection rates that are over or underestimated. As of yet, real-world
policymaking has not seen adoption of machine learning methods at large,
including RL and AI-driven simulations. Our results show the potential of AI to
guide policy design and improve social welfare amidst the complexity of the
real world.]]></summary>

system. The success or failure of a software project is firmly tied to this
phase, based on communication among stakeholders using natural language. The
problem with natural language is that it can easily lead to different
understandings if it is not expressed precisely by the stakeholders involved,
which results in building a product different from the expected one. Previous
work proposed to enhance the quality of the software requirements detecting
language errors based on ISO 29148 requirements language criteria. The existing
solutions apply classical Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect them. NLP
has some limitations, such as domain dependability which results in poor
generalization capability. Therefore, this work aims to improve the previous
work by creating a manually labeled dataset and using ensemble learning, Deep
Learning (DL), and techniques such as word embeddings and transfer learning to
overcome the generalization problem that is tied with classical NLP and improve
precision and recall metrics using a manually labeled dataset. The current
findings show that the dataset is unbalanced and which class examples should be
added more. It is tempting to train algorithms even if the dataset is not
considerably representative. Whence, the results show that models are
overfitting; in Machine Learning this issue is solved by adding more instances
to the dataset, improving label quality, removing noise, and reducing the
learning algorithms complexity, which is planned for this research.]]></summary>

Traditionally, choosing the model requires the designer to balance between two
goals of conflicting nature; the model must be rich enough to capture the
system dynamics, but not so flexible that it learns spurious random effects
from the dataset. It is typically observed that the model validation
performance follows a U-shaped curve as the model complexity increases. Recent
developments in machine learning and statistics, however, have observed
situations where a "double-descent" curve subsumes this U-shaped
model-performance curve. With a second decrease in performance occurring beyond
the point where the model has reached the capacity of interpolating - i.e.,
(near) perfectly fitting - the training data. To the best of our knowledge,
such phenomena have not been studied within the context of dynamic systems. The
present paper aims to answer the question: "Can such a phenomenon also be
observed when estimating parameters of dynamic systems?" We show that the
answer is yes, verifying such behavior experimentally both for artificially
generated and real-world datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Extreme Learning Machine is a powerful classification method very competitive
existing classification methods. It is extremely fast at training.
Nevertheless, it cannot perform face verification tasks properly because face
verification tasks require comparison of facial images of two individuals at
the same time and decide whether the two faces identify the same person. The
structure of Extreme Leaning Machine was not designed to feed two input data
streams simultaneously, thus, in 2-input scenarios Extreme Learning Machine
methods are normally applied using concatenated inputs. However, this setup
consumes two times more computational resources and it is not optimized for
recognition tasks where learning a separable distance metric is critical. For
these reasons, we propose and develop a Siamese Extreme Learning Machine
(SELM). SELM was designed to be fed with two data streams in parallel
simultaneously. It utilizes a dual-stream Siamese condition in the extra
Siamese layer to transform the data before passing it along to the hidden
layer. Moreover, we propose a Gender-Ethnicity-Dependent triplet feature
exclusively trained on a variety of specific demographic groups. This feature
enables learning and extracting of useful facial features of each group.
Experiments were conducted to evaluate and compare the performances of SELM,
Extreme Learning Machine, and DCNN. The experimental results showed that the
proposed feature was able to perform correct classification at 97.87% accuracy
and 99.45% AUC. They also showed that using SELM in conjunction with the
proposed feature provided 98.31% accuracy and 99.72% AUC. They outperformed the
well-known DCNN and Extreme Leaning Machine methods by a wide margin.]]></summary>

nature. However, simulating bulk materials fully at these scales is not
feasible, so that typically homogenized continuum descriptions are used
instead. A seamless and lossless transition of the constitutive description of
the elastic response of materials between these two scales has been so far
elusive. Here we show how this problem can be overcome by using Artificial
Intelligence (AI). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained, by
taking the structure image of a nanoporous material as input and the
corresponding elasticity tensor, calculated from Molecular Statics (MS), as
output. Trained with the atomistic data, the CNN model captures the size- and
pore-dependency of the material's elastic properties which, on the physics
side, can stem from surfaces and non-local effects. Such effects are often
ignored in upscaling from atomistic to classical continuum theory. To
demonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the trained CNN model, a Finite
Element Method (FEM) based result of an elastically deformed nanoporous beam
equipped with the CNN as constitutive law is compared with that by a full
atomistic simulation. The good agreement between the atomistic simulations and
the FEM-AI combination for a system with size and surface effects establishes a
new lossless scale bridging approach to such problems. The trained CNN model
deviates from the atomistic result by 9.6\% for porosity scenarios of up to
90\% but it is about 230 times faster than the MS calculation and does not
require to change simulation methods between different scales. The efficiency
of the CNN evaluation together with the preservation of important atomistic
effects makes the trained model an effective atomistically-informed
constitutive model for macroscopic simulations of nanoporous materials and
solving of inverse problems.]]></summary>

effect heterogeneity across a large population of individuals. However, typical
CATE learners assume all confounding variables are measured in order for the
CATE to be identifiable. Often, this requirement is satisfied by simply
collecting many variables, at the expense of increased sample complexity for
estimating CATEs. To combat this, we propose an energy-based model (EBM) that
learns a low-dimensional representation of the variables by employing a noise
contrastive loss function. With our EBM we introduce a preprocessing step that
alleviates the dimensionality curse for any existing model and learner
developed for estimating CATE. We prove that our EBM keeps the representations
partially identifiable up to some universal constant, as well as having
universal approximation capability to avoid excessive information loss from
model misspecification; these properties combined with our loss function,
enable the representations to converge and keep the CATE estimation consistent.
Experiments demonstrate the convergence of the representations, as well as show
that estimating CATEs on our representations performs better than on the
variables or the representations obtained via various benchmark dimensionality
reduction methods.]]></summary>

(CSVD-QR) method for matrix complete problem is presented, whose computational
complexity is $O(r^2(m+n))$, which is mainly due to that $r$ is far less than
$\min\{m,n\}$, where $r$ represents the largest number of singular values of
matrix $X$. What is particularly interesting is that after replacing the
nuclear norm with the $L_{2,1}$ norm proposed based on this decomposition, as
the upper bound of the nuclear norm, when the intermediate matrix $D$ in its
decomposition is close to the diagonal matrix, it will converge to the nuclear
norm, and is exactly equal, when the $D$ matrix is equal to the diagonal
matrix, to the nuclear norm, which ingeniously avoids the calculation of the
singular value of the matrix. To the best of our knowledge, there is no
literature to generalize and apply it to solve tensor complete problems.
Inspired by this, in this paper we propose a class of tensor minimization model
based on $L_{2,1}$ norm and CSVD-QR method for the tensor complete problem,
which is convex and therefore has a global minimum solution.]]></summary>

life globally, and a critical factor in mitigating its effects is screening
individuals for infections, thereby allowing for both proper treatment for
those individuals as well as action to be taken to prevent further spread of
the virus. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) imaging has been proposed as a
screening tool as it is a much cheaper and easier to apply imaging modality
than others that are traditionally used for pulmonary examinations, namely
chest x-ray and computed tomography. Given the scarcity of expert radiologists
for interpreting POCUS examinations in many highly affected regions around the
world, low-cost deep learning-driven clinical decision support solutions can
have a large impact during the on-going pandemic. Motivated by this, we
introduce COVID-Net US, a highly efficient, self-attention deep convolutional
neural network design tailored for COVID-19 screening from lung POCUS images.
Experimental results show that the proposed COVID-Net US can achieve an AUC of
over 0.98 while achieving 353X lower architectural complexity, 62X lower
computational complexity, and 14.3X faster inference times on a Raspberry Pi.
Clinical validation was also conducted, where select cases were reviewed and
reported on by a practicing clinician (20 years of clinical practice)
specializing in intensive care (ICU) and 15 years of expertise in POCUS
interpretation. To advocate affordable healthcare and artificial intelligence
for resource-constrained environments, we have made COVID-Net US open source

select the best performing model by evaluating the annualized return,
annualized Sharpe ratio, and Calmar ratio of the portfolios that includes the
top four ranked sectors chosen by the model. We also test the robustness of the
model performance with respect to lookback windows and look ahead windows. Our
empirical results show that our methodology beats the equally weighted

other side, verifying the labels by the annotators is not cost-efficient. For

this purpose, we study three different latent space representations:
multivariate Time Series t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (mTSNE),
Recurrent Auto-Encoder (RAE) and Variational Recurrent Auto-Encoder (VRAE). We
then apply different active learning paradigms with different classification
models to the embedded data. In particular, we study the two classifiers Neural
Network (NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), with three active learning

associated with a seizure from normal neural activity in a variety of
conditions. Our approach is to seek spatiotemporal waveforms with distinct
morphology in electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings of epileptic patients
that are indicative of a subsequent seizure (preictal) versus non-seizure
segments (interictal). To find these waveforms we apply a shift-invariant
k-means algorithm to segments of spatially filtered signals to learn codebooks
of prototypical waveforms. The frequency of the cluster labels from the
codebooks is then used to train a binary classifier that predicts the class
(preictal or interictal) of a test ECoG segment. We use the Matthews
correlation coefficient to evaluate the performance of the classifier and the
quality of the codebooks. We found that our method finds recurrent
non-sinusoidal waveforms that could be used to build interpretable features for
seizure prediction and that are also physiologically meaningful.]]></summary>

equi-dimensional space via a complex mapping which induces the robust Euler
kernel and next employs the popular $k$-means. Consequently, besides enjoying
the virtues of k-means such as simplicity and scalability to large data sets,
EulerK is also robust to noises and outliers. Although so, the centroids
captured by EulerK deviate from the unit hyper-sphere surface and thus in
strict distributional sense, actually are outliers. This weird phenomenon also
occurs in some generic kernel clustering methods. Intuitively, using such
outlier-like centroids should not be quite reasonable but it is still seldom
attended. To eliminate the deviation, we propose two Rectified Euler k-means
methods, i.e., REK1 and REK2, which retain the merits of EulerK while acquire
real centroids residing on the mapped space to better characterize the data
structures. Specifically, REK1 rectifies EulerK by imposing the constraint on
the centroids while REK2 views each centroid as the mapped image from a
pre-image in the original space and optimizes these pre-images in Euler kernel
induced space. Undoubtedly, our proposed REKs can methodologically be extended
to solve problems of such a category. Finally, the experiments validate the

appropriate indicator weights obscure understanding of bank credit ratings.
Furthermore, existing models fail to consider bank types by just applying a

supports interactively inferring indicator weights for banks by involving
domain knowledge and considers bank types in the analysis loop. We conduct a

energy-limited, and thus supplying energy while maintaining seamless
connectivity for IoT devices is of considerable importance. In this context, we
propose a simultaneous wireless power transfer and information transmission
scheme for IoT devices with support from reconfigurable intelligent surface
(RIS)-aided unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. In particular, in a
first phase, IoT devices harvest energy from the UAV through wireless power
transfer; and then in a second phase, the UAV collects data from the IoT
devices through information transmission. To characterise the agility of the
UAV, we consider two scenarios: a hovering UAV and a mobile UAV. Aiming at
maximizing the total network sum-rate, we jointly optimize the trajectory of
the UAV, the energy harvesting scheduling of IoT devices, and the phaseshift
matrix of the RIS. We formulate a Markov decision process and propose two deep
reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the optimization problem of
maximizing the total network sum-rate. Numerical results illustrate the
effectiveness of the UAV's flying path optimization and the network's
throughput of our proposed techniques compared with other benchmark schemes.
Given the strict requirements of the RIS and UAV, the significant improvement
in processing time and throughput performance demonstrates that our proposed
scheme is well applicable for practical IoT applications.]]></summary>

social event detection tasks. However, most studies are oriented toward
monolingual data in languages with abundant training samples. This has left the
more common multilingual settings and lesser-spoken languages relatively
unexplored. Thus, we present a GNN that incorporates cross-lingual word
embeddings for detecting events in multilingual data streams. The first exploit
is to make the GNN work with multilingual data. For this, we outline a
construction strategy that aligns messages in different languages at both the
node and semantic levels. Relationships between messages are established by
merging entities that are the same but are referred to in different languages.
Non-English message representations are converted into English semantic space
via the cross-lingual word embeddings. The resulting message graph is then
uniformly encoded by a GNN model. In special cases where a lesser-spoken
language needs to be detected, a novel cross-lingual knowledge distillation
framework, called CLKD, exploits prior knowledge learned from similar threads
in English to make up for the paucity of annotated data. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show the framework to be highly effective at
detection in both multilingual data and in languages where training samples are
scarce.]]></summary>

theory to obtain highly generalizable results in this vein. However, this
approach requires the reader to be familiar with and make many deep connections
to different research areas. A student seeking to deepen their understand of
Q-learning risks becoming caught in a vicious cycle of "RL-learning Hell". For

systems to motions in cell organelles, biological tissues or ecology, and also
in artificial materials, such as cement. Being able to accurately measure the
anomalous exponent associated with a given particle trajectory, thus
determining whether the particle subdiffuses, superdiffuses or performs normal
diffusion is of key importance to understand the diffusion process. Also, it is
often important to trustingly identify the model behind the trajectory, as this
gives a large amount of information on the system dynamics. Both aspects are
particularly difficult when the input data are short and noisy trajectories. It
is even more difficult if one cannot guarantee that the trajectories output in
experiments is homogeneous, hindering the statistical methods based on
ensembles of trajectories. We present a data-driven method able to infer the
anomalous exponent and to identify the type of anomalous diffusion process
behind single, noisy and short trajectories, with good accuracy. This model was

intelligence (AI), enabling researchers to devise cognitive AI systems and
affords an intuitive means for users to interact with the robot. Of note,
communication plays a central role. To date, prior studies in embodied agent
navigation have only demonstrated that human languages facilitate communication
by instructions in natural languages. Nevertheless, a plethora of other forms
of communication is left unexplored. In fact, human communication originated in
gestures and oftentimes is delivered through multimodal cues, e.g. "go there"
with a pointing gesture. To bridge the gap and fill in the missing dimension of
communication in embodied agent navigation, we propose investigating the
effects of using gestures as the communicative interface instead of verbal
cues. Specifically, we develop a VR-based 3D simulation environment, named
Ges-THOR, based on AI2-THOR platform. In this virtual environment, a human
player is placed in the same virtual scene and shepherds the artificial agent
using only gestures. The agent is tasked to solve the navigation problem guided
by natural gestures with unknown semantics; we do not use any predefined
gestures due to the diversity and versatile nature of human gestures. We argue
that learning the semantics of natural gestures is mutually beneficial to
learning the navigation task--learn to communicate and communicate to learn. In
a series of experiments, we demonstrate that human gesture cues, even without
predefined semantics, improve the object-goal navigation for an embodied agent,
outperforming various state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Understanding a controller's performance in different scenarios is crucial
for robots that are going to be deployed in safety-critical tasks. If we do not
have a model of the dynamics of the world, which is often the case in complex
domains, we may need to approximate a performance function of the robot based
on its interaction with the environment. Such a performance function gives us
insights into the behaviour of the robot, allowing us to fine-tune the
controller with manual interventions. In high-dimensionality systems, where the
actionstate space is large, fine-tuning a controller is non-trivial. To
overcome this problem, we propose a performance function whose domain is
defined by external features and parameters of the controller. Attainment
regions are defined over such a domain defined by feature-parameter pairs, and
serve the purpose of enabling prediction of successful execution of the task.
The use of the feature-parameter space -in contrast to the action-state space-
allows us to adapt, explain and finetune the controller over a simpler (i.e.,
lower dimensional space). When the robot successfully executes the task, we use
the attainment regions to gain insights into the limits of the controller, and
its robustness. When the robot fails to execute the task, we use the regions to
debug the controller and find adaptive and counterfactual changes to the
solutions. Another advantage of this approach is that we can generalise through
the use of Gaussian processes regression of the performance function in the

consequences to physical health. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased
stress levels among people across the globe. Therefore, continuous monitoring
and detection of stress are necessary. The recent advances in wearable devices
have allowed the monitoring of several physiological signals related to stress.
Among them, wrist-worn wearable devices like smartwatches are most popular due
to their convenient usage. And the photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor is the
most prevalent sensor in almost all consumer-grade wrist-worn smartwatches.
Therefore, this paper focuses on using a wrist-based PPG sensor that collects
Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) signals to detect stress which may be applicable for
consumer-grade wristwatches. Moreover, state-of-the-art works have used either
classical machine learning algorithms to detect stress using hand-crafted
features or have used deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) which automatically extracts features. This paper proposes a
novel hybrid CNN (H-CNN) classifier that uses both the hand-crafted features
and the automatically extracted features by CNN to detect stress using the BVP
signal. Evaluation on the benchmark WESAD dataset shows that, for 3-class
classification (Baseline vs. Stress vs. Amusement), our proposed H-CNN
outperforms traditional classifiers and normal CNN by 5% and 7% accuracy, and
10% and 7% macro F1 score, respectively. Also for 2-class classification
(Stress vs. Non-stress), our proposed H-CNN outperforms traditional classifiers
and normal CNN by 3% and ~5% accuracy, and ~3% and ~7% macro F1 score,
respectively.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new machine learning (ML) technique termed as federated learning (FL) aims
to preserve data at the edge devices and to only exchange ML model parameters
in the learning process. FL not only reduces the communication needs but also
helps to protect the local privacy. Although FL has these advantages, it can
still experience large communication latency when there are massive edge
devices connected to the central parameter server (PS) and/or millions of model
parameters involved in the learning process. Over-the-air computation (AirComp)
is capable of computing while transmitting data by allowing multiple devices to
send data simultaneously by using analog modulation. To achieve good
performance in FL through AirComp, user scheduling plays a critical role. In
this paper, we investigate and compare different user scheduling policies,
which are based on various criteria such as wireless channel conditions and the
significance of model updates. Receiver beamforming is applied to minimize the
mean-square-error (MSE) of the distortion of function aggregation result via
AirComp. Simulation results show that scheduling based on the significance of
model updates has smaller fluctuations in the training process while scheduling
based on channel condition has the advantage on energy efficiency.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The merit of ensemble learning lies in having different outputs from many
individual models on a single input, i.e., the diversity of the base models.
The high quality of diversity can be achieved when each model is specialized to
different subsets of the whole dataset. Moreover, when each model explicitly
knows to which subsets it is specialized, more opportunities arise to improve
diversity. In this paper, we propose an advanced ensemble method, called
Auxiliary class based Multiple Choice Learning (AMCL), to ultimately specialize
each model under the framework of multiple choice learning (MCL). The
advancement of AMCL is originated from three novel techniques which control the
framework from different directions: 1) the concept of auxiliary class to
provide more distinct information through the labels, 2) the strategy, named
memory-based assignment, to determine the association between the inputs and
the models, and 3) the feature fusion module to achieve generalized features.
To demonstrate the performance of our method compared to all variants of MCL
methods, we conduct extensive experiments on the image classification and
segmentation tasks. Overall, the performance of AMCL exceeds all others in most
of the public datasets trained with various networks as members of the
ensembles.]]></summary>

Specifically, we have applied the graph convolution network (GCN) to enable CRM
analytics to forecast sales. This is the first step towards a GCN-based binary
classification based on graph databases in the domain of B2B CRM. We evaluate
the performance of the proposed GCN model on graph databases and compare it
with Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Artificial

shortest path and eigenvector centrality attribute to significantly improve the

self-supervised fashion based on the augmentations and subsequently fine-tune.
Experiments are performed on the Oulu-CASIA dataset and the performance is

profound research interest has emerged to understand the innate immune response
to viruses. This understanding can help to inhibit virus replication, prolong
adaptive immune response, accelerated virus clearance, and tissue recovery, a
key milestone to propose a vaccine to combat coronaviruses (CoVs), e.g.,
Covid-19. Although an innate immune system triggers inflammatory responses
against CoVs upon recognition of viruses, however, a vaccine is the ultimate
protection against CoV spread. The development of this vaccine is
time-consuming and requires a deep understanding of the innate immune response
system. In this work, we propose a graph neural network-based model that
exploits the interactions between pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), i.e.,
the human immune response system. These interactions can help to recognize
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to predict the activation
requirements of each PRR. The immune response information of each PRR is
derived from combining its historical PAMPs activation coupled with the modeled
effect on the same from PRRs in its neighborhood. On one hand, this work can
help to understand how long Covid-19 can confer immunity where a strong immune
response means people already been infected can safely return to work. On the
other hand, this GNN-based understanding can also abode well for vaccine
development efforts. Our proposal has been evaluated using CoVs immune response
dataset, with results showing an average IFNs activation prediction accuracy of
90%, compared to 85% using feed-forward neural networks.]]></summary>

in contrast to previous more complex multi-stage methods. The end-to-end
training gradually improves pseudo label qualities during the curriculum, and
the more and more accurate pseudo labels in turn benefit object detection
training. We also propose two simple yet effective techniques within this
framework: a soft teacher mechanism where the classification loss of each
unlabeled bounding box is weighed by the classification score produced by the
teacher network; a box jittering approach to select reliable pseudo boxes for
the learning of box regression. On the COCO benchmark, the proposed approach
outperforms previous methods by a large margin under various labeling ratios,
i.e. 1\%, 5\% and 10\%. Moreover, our approach proves to perform also well when
the amount of labeled data is relatively large. For example, it can improve a
40.9 mAP baseline detector trained using the full COCO training set by +3.6
mAP, reaching 44.5 mAP, by leveraging the 123K unlabeled images of COCO. On the
state-of-the-art Swin Transformer based object detector (58.9 mAP on test-dev),
it can still significantly improve the detection accuracy by +1.5 mAP, reaching
60.4 mAP, and improve the instance segmentation accuracy by +1.2 mAP, reaching
52.4 mAP. Further incorporating with the Object365 pre-trained model, the

become easily spread through social media. The most cost and time effective way
to filter these large amounts of data is to use a combination of human and
technical interventions to identify it. From a technical perspective, Natural
Language Processing (NLP) is widely used in detecting fake news. Social media
companies use NLP techniques to identify the fake news and warn their users,
but fake news may still slip through undetected. It is especially a problem in
more localised contexts (outside the United States of America). How do we
adjust fake news detection systems to work better for local contexts such as in
South Africa. In this work we investigate fake news detection on South African
websites. We curate a dataset of South African fake news and then train
detection models. We contrast this with using widely available fake news
datasets (from mostly USA website). We also explore making the datasets more
diverse by combining them and observe the differences in behaviour in writing
between nations' fake news using interpretable machine learning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent work has shown the efficiency of deep learning models such as Fully
Convolutional Networks (FCN) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to deal with
Time Series Regression (TSR) problems. These models sometimes need a lot of
data to be able to generalize, yet the time series are sometimes not long
enough to be able to learn patterns. Therefore, it is important to make use of
information across time series to improve learning. In this paper, we will
explore the idea of using meta-learning for quickly adapting model parameters
to new short-history time series by modifying the original idea of Model
Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) \cite{finn2017model}. Moreover, based on prior
work on multimodal MAML \cite{vuorio2019multimodal}, we propose a method for
conditioning parameters of the model through an auxiliary network that encodes
global information of the time series to extract meta-features. Finally, we
apply the data to time series of different domains, such as pollution
measurements, heart-rate sensors, and electrical battery data. We show
empirically that our proposed meta-learning method learns TSR with few data
fast and outperforms the baselines in 9 of 12 experiments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The need of predictive maintenance comes with an increasing number of
incidents reported by monitoring systems and equipment/software users. In the
front line, on-call engineers (OCEs) have to quickly assess the degree of
severity of an incident and decide which service to contact for corrective
actions. To automate these decisions, several predictive models have been
proposed, but the most efficient models are opaque (say, black box), strongly
limiting their adoption. In this paper, we propose an efficient black box model
based on 170K incidents reported to our company over the last 7 years and
emphasize on the need of automating triage when incidents are massively
reported on thousands of servers running our product, an ERP. Recent
developments in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) help in providing
global explanations to the model, but also, and most importantly, with local
explanations for each model prediction/outcome. Sadly, providing a human with
an explanation for each outcome is not conceivable when dealing with an
important number of daily predictions. To address this problem, we propose an
original data-mining method rooted in Subgroup Discovery, a pattern mining
technique with the natural ability to group objects that share similar
explanations of their black box predictions and provide a description for each
group. We evaluate this approach and present our preliminary results which give
us good hope towards an effective OCE's adoption. We believe that this approach
provides a new way to address the problem of model agnostic outcome
explanation.]]></summary>

module that enforces the segmentation network to yield similar pixel-level

alternative assets such as private equity funds in their portfolios, yet there
exists a very limited literature on cash flow forecasting of illiquid
alternative assets. The net cash flow of private equity funds typically follow
a J-curve pattern, however the timing and the size of the contributions and
distributions depend on the investment opportunities. In this paper, we develop
a benchmark model and present two novel approaches (direct vs. indirect) to
predict the cash flows of private equity funds. We introduce a sliding window
approach to apply on our cash flow data because different vintage year funds
contain different lengths of cash flow information. We then pass the data to an
LSTM/ GRU model to predict the future cash flows either directly or indirectly
(based on the benchmark model). We further integrate macroeconomic indicators
into our data, which allows us to consider the impact of market environment on
cash flows and to apply stress testing. Our results indicate that the direct
model is easier to implement compared to the benchmark model and the indirect
model, but still the predicted cash flows align better with the actual cash
flows. We also show that macroeconomic variables improve the performance of the
direct model whereas the impact is not obvious on the indirect model.]]></summary>

plagued with long-lasting or permanent residual symptoms, whose severity, rate
of development, and resolution after treatment vary largely between survivors.
The analysis and interpretation of symptoms is complicated by their partial
co-occurrence, variability across populations and across time, and, in the case
of cancers that use radiotherapy, by further symptom dependency on the tumor
location and prescribed treatment. We describe THALIS, an environment for
visual analysis and knowledge discovery from cancer therapy symptom data,
developed in close collaboration with oncology experts. Our approach leverages
unsupervised machine learning methodology over cohorts of patients, and, in
conjunction with custom visual encodings and interactions, provides context for
new patients based on patients with similar diagnostic features and symptom
evolution. We evaluate this approach on data collected from a cohort of head
and neck cancer patients. Feedback from our clinician collaborators indicates
that THALIS supports knowledge discovery beyond the limits of machines or
humans alone, and that it serves as a valuable tool in both the clinic and
symptom research.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coronaviruses constitute a family of viruses that gives rise to respiratory
diseases. As COVID-19 is highly contagious, early diagnosis of COVID-19 is
crucial for an effective treatment strategy. However, the RT-PCR test which is
considered to be a gold standard in the diagnosis of COVID-19 suffers from a
high false-negative rate. Chest X-ray (CXR) image analysis has emerged as a
feasible and effective diagnostic technique towards this objective. In this
work, we propose the COVID-19 classification problem as a three-class
classification problem to distinguish between COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia
classes. We propose a three-stage framework, named COV-ELM. Stage one deals
with preprocessing and transformation while stage two deals with feature
extraction. These extracted features are passed as an input to the ELM at the
third stage, resulting in the identification of COVID-19. The choice of ELM in
this work has been motivated by its faster convergence, better generalization
capability, and shorter training time in comparison to the conventional
gradient-based learning algorithms. As bigger and diverse datasets become
available, ELM can be quickly retrained as compared to its gradient-based
competitor models. The proposed model achieved a macro average F1-score of 0.95
and the overall sensitivity of ${0.94 \pm 0.02} at a 95% confidence interval.
When compared to state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, the COV-ELM is
found to outperform its competitors in this three-class classification
scenario. Further, LIME has been integrated with the proposed COV-ELM model to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hate speech is a specific type of controversial content that is widely
legislated as a crime that must be identified and blocked. However, due to the
sheer volume and velocity of the Twitter data stream, hate speech detection
cannot be performed manually. To address this issue, several studies have been
conducted for hate speech detection in European languages, whereas little
attention has been paid to low-resource South Asian languages, making the
social media vulnerable for millions of users. In particular, to the best of
our knowledge, no study has been conducted for hate speech detection in Roman
Urdu text, which is widely used in the sub-continent. In this study, we have
scrapped more than 90,000 tweets and manually parsed them to identify 5,000
Roman Urdu tweets. Subsequently, we have employed an iterative approach to
develop guidelines and used them for generating the Hate Speech Roman Urdu 2020
corpus. The tweets in the this corpus are classified at three levels:
Neutral-Hostile, Simple-Complex, and Offensive-Hate speech. As another
contribution, we have used five supervised learning techniques, including a
deep learning technique, to evaluate and compare their effectiveness for hate
speech detection. The results show that Logistic Regression outperformed all
other techniques, including deep learning techniques for the two levels of
classification, by achieved an F1 score of 0.906 for distinguishing between
Neutral-Hostile tweets, and 0.756 for distinguishing between Offensive-Hate
speech tweets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adversarial robustness of deep learning models has gained much traction in
the last few years. Various attacks and defenses are proposed to improve the
adversarial robustness of modern-day deep learning architectures. While all
these approaches help improve the robustness, one promising direction for
improving adversarial robustness is un-explored, i.e., the complex topology of
the neural network architecture. In this work, we answer the following
question: "Can the complex topology of a neural network give adversarial
robustness without any form of adversarial training?" empirically by
experimenting with different hand-crafted and NAS based architectures. Our
findings show that, for small-scale attacks, NAS-based architectures are more
robust for small-scale datasets and simple tasks than hand-crafted
architectures. However, as the dataset's size or the task's complexity
increase, hand-crafted architectures are more robust than NAS-based
architectures. We perform the first large scale study to understand adversarial
robustness purely from an architectural perspective. Our results show that
random sampling in the search space of DARTS (a popular NAS method) with simple
ensembling can improve the robustness to PGD attack by nearly ~12\%. We show
that NAS, which is popular for SoTA accuracy, can provide adversarial accuracy
as a free add-on without any form of adversarial training. Our results show
that leveraging the power of neural network topology with methods like
ensembles can be an excellent way to achieve adversarial robustness without any
form of adversarial training. We also introduce a metric that can be used to
calculate the trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness.]]></summary>

of machine learning such as decision making, it is therefore very difficult to
establish clear and direct objectives for training representation learning
models. It has been argued that a good representation should disentangle the
underlying variation factors, yet how to translate this into training
objectives remains unknown. This paper presents an attempt to establish direct
training criterions and design principles for developing good representation
learning models. We propose that a good representation learning model should be
maximally expressive, i.e., capable of distinguishing the maximum number of
input configurations. We formally define expressiveness and introduce the
maximum expressiveness (MEXS) theorem of a general learning model. We propose
to train a model by maximizing its expressiveness while at the same time
incorporating general priors such as model smoothness. We present a conscience
competitive learning algorithm which encourages the model to reach its MEXS
whilst at the same time adheres to model smoothness prior. We also introduce a
label consistent training (LCT) technique to boost model smoothness by
encouraging it to assign consistent labels to similar samples. We present
extensive experimental results to show that our method can indeed design
representation learning models capable of developing representations that are
as good as or better than state of the art. We also show that our technique is
computationally efficient, robust against different parameter settings and can
work effectively on a variety of datasets. Code available at

human shape and dressed garments accurately with only a single 3D human scan,
which enables numerous applications such as virtual try-on, biometrics and body
evaluation. To break the severe variations of the human poses and garments, we
propose to model the clothing tightness - the displacements from the garments
to the human shape implicitly in the global UV texturing domain. To this end,
we utilize an enhanced statistical human template and an effective multi-stage
alignment scheme to map the 3D scan into a hybrid 2D geometry image. Based on
this 2D representation, we propose a novel framework to predicted clothing
tightness via a novel tightness formulation, as well as an effective
optimization scheme to further reconstruct multi-layer human shape and garments
under various clothing categories and human postures. We further propose a new
clothing tightness dataset (CTD) of human scans with a large variety of
clothing styles, poses and corresponding ground-truth human shapes to stimulate
further research. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
TightCap to achieve high-quality human shape and dressed garments
reconstruction, as well as the further applications for clothing segmentation,

ranked play, which utilizes a skill-based matchmaking system to form fair

outcomes can be predicted with 75.1% accuracy after all players have selected
champions, which occurs before gameplay begins. Our results have important
implications for playing LoL and matchmaking. Firstly, individual champion
skill plays a significant role in the outcome of a match, regardless of team
composition. Secondly, even after the skill-based matchmaking, there is still a
wide variance in team skill before gameplay begins. Finally, players should
only play champions that they have mastered, if they want to win games.]]></summary>

encourages inter-class separability and intra-class compactness in learned

classes in an image, using CL to learn representations of local features (as
opposed to global) is important. In this work, we present a novel
semi-supervised 2D medical segmentation solution that applies CL on image
patches, instead of full images. These patches are meaningfully constructed
using the semantic information of different classes obtained via pseudo
labeling. We also propose a novel consistency regularization (CR) scheme, which
works in synergy with CL. It addresses the problem of confirmation bias, and
encourages better clustering in the feature space. We evaluate our method on
four public medical segmentation datasets and a novel histopathology dataset
that we introduce. Our method obtains consistent improvements over

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quantum computing offers the potential of exponential speedups for certain
classical computations. Over the last decade, many quantum machine learning
(QML) algorithms have been proposed as candidates for such exponential
improvements. However, two issues unravel the hope of exponential speedup for
some of these QML algorithms: the data-loading problem and, more recently, the
stunning dequantization results of Tang et al. A third issue, namely the
fault-tolerance requirements of most QML algorithms, has further hindered their
practical realization. The quantum topological data analysis (QTDA) algorithm
of Lloyd, Garnerone and Zanardi was one of the first QML algorithms that
convincingly offered an expected exponential speedup. From the outset, it did
not suffer from the data-loading problem. A recent result has also shown that
the generalized problem solved by this algorithm is likely classically
intractable, and would therefore be immune to any dequantization efforts.
However, the QTDA algorithm of Lloyd et~al. has a time complexity of
$O(n^4/(\epsilon^2 \delta))$ (where $n$ is the number of data points,
$\epsilon$ is the error tolerance, and $\delta$ is the smallest nonzero
eigenvalue of the restricted Laplacian) and requires fault-tolerant quantum
computing, which has not yet been achieved. In this paper, we completely
overhaul the QTDA algorithm to achieve an improved exponential speedup and
depth complexity of $O(n\log(1/(\delta\epsilon)))$. Our approach includes three
key innovations: (a) an efficient realization of the combinatorial Laplacian as
a sum of Pauli operators; (b) a quantum rejection sampling approach to restrict
the superposition to the simplices in the complex; and (c) a stochastic rank
estimation method to estimate the Betti numbers. We present a theoretical error
analysis, and the circuit and computational time and depth complexities for
Betti number estimation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In image fusion, images obtained from different sensors are fused to generate
a single image with enhanced information. In recent years, state-of-the-art
methods have adopted Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to encode meaningful
features for image fusion. Specifically, CNN-based methods perform image fusion
by fusing local features. However, they do not consider long-range dependencies
that are present in the image. Transformer-based models are designed to
overcome this by modeling the long-range dependencies with the help of
self-attention mechanism. This motivates us to propose a novel Image Fusion
Transformer (IFT) where we develop a transformer-based multi-scale fusion
strategy that attends to both local and long-range information (or global
context). The proposed method follows a two-stage training approach. In the
first stage, we train an auto-encoder to extract deep features at multiple
scales. In the second stage, multi-scale features are fused using a
Spatio-Transformer (ST) fusion strategy. The ST fusion blocks are comprised of
a CNN and a transformer branch which capture local and long-range features,
respectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that
the proposed method performs better than many competitive fusion algorithms.
Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of the proposed ST fusion strategy with
an ablation analysis. The source code is available at:

efforts, and expertise knowledge. In recent, many researchers use deep learning
methods to classify plants directly using plant images. While deep learning
models have achieved a great success, the lack of interpretability limit their
widespread application. To overcome this, we explore the use of interpretable,
measurable and computer-aided features extracted from plant leaf images. Image
processing is one of the most challenging, and crucial steps in
feature-extraction. The purpose of image processing is to improve the leaf
image by removing undesired distortion. The main image processing steps of our
algorithm involves: i) Convert original image to RGB (Red-Green-Blue) image,
ii) Gray scaling, iii) Gaussian smoothing, iv) Binary thresholding, v) Remove
stalk, vi) Closing holes, and vii) Resize image. The next step after image
processing is to extract features from plant leaf images. We introduced 52
computationally efficient features to classify plant species. These features
are mainly classified into four groups as: i) shape-based features, ii)
color-based features, iii) texture-based features, and iv) scagnostic features.
Length, width, area, texture correlation, monotonicity and scagnostics are to
name few of them. We explore the ability of features to discriminate the
classes of interest under supervised learning and unsupervised learning
settings. For that, supervised dimensionality reduction technique, Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and unsupervised dimensionality reduction
technique, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are used to convert and visualize
the images from digital-image space to feature space. The results show that the
features are sufficient to discriminate the classes of interest under both
supervised and unsupervised learning settings.]]></summary>

task by traditional deep learning-based methods. A limitation of current SOD
models is insufficient utilization of inter-pixel information, which usually
results in imperfect segmentation near edge regions and low spatial coherence.
As we demonstrate, using a saliency mask as the only label is suboptimal. To
address this limitation, we propose a connectivity-based approach called
bilateral connectivity network (BiconNet), which uses connectivity masks
together with saliency masks as labels for effective modeling of inter-pixel
relationships and object saliency. Moreover, we propose a bilateral voting
module to enhance the output connectivity map, and a novel edge feature
enhancement method that efficiently utilizes edge-specific features. Through
comprehensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our
proposed method can be plugged into any existing state-of-the-art
saliency-based SOD framework to improve its performance with negligible

for diabetic retinopathy prevention. Automated segmentation of fundus
photographs would improve the quality, capacity, and cost-effectiveness of eye
care screening programs. However, current segmentation methods are not robust
towards the diversity in imaging conditions and pathologies typical for
real-world clinical applications. To overcome these limitations, we utilized
contrastive self-supervised learning to exploit the large variety of unlabeled
fundus images in the publicly available EyePACS dataset. We pre-trained an
encoder of a U-Net, which we later fine-tuned on several retinal vessel and
lesion segmentation datasets. We demonstrate for the first time that by using
contrastive self-supervised learning, the pre-trained network can recognize
blood vessels, optic disc, fovea, and various lesions without being provided
any labels. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on a downstream blood vessel
segmentation task, such pre-trained networks achieve state-of-the-art
performance on images from different datasets. Additionally, the pre-training
also leads to shorter training times and an improved few-shot performance on
both blood vessel and lesion segmentation tasks. Altogether, our results
showcase the benefits of contrastive self-supervised pre-training which can
play a crucial role in real-world clinical applications requiring robust models
able to adapt to new devices with only a few annotated samples.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) maps have emerged as one of the most powerful
representations for scene understanding due to their ability to provide rich
spatial context while being easy to interpret and process. However, generating
BEV maps requires complex multi-stage paradigms that encapsulate a series of
distinct tasks such as depth estimation, ground plane estimation, and semantic
segmentation. These sub-tasks are often learned in a disjoint manner which
prevents the model from holistic reasoning and results in erroneous BEV maps.
Moreover, existing algorithms only predict the semantics in the BEV space,
which limits their use in applications where the notion of object instances is
critical. In this work, we present the first end-to-end learning approach for
directly predicting dense panoptic segmentation maps in the BEV, given a single
monocular image in the frontal view (FV). Our architecture follows the top-down
paradigm and incorporates a novel dense transformer module consisting of two
distinct transformers that learn to independently map vertical and flat regions
in the input image from the FV to the BEV. Additionally, we derive a
mathematical formulation for the sensitivity of the FV-BEV transformation which
allows us to intelligently weight pixels in the BEV space to account for the
varying descriptiveness across the FV image. Extensive evaluations on the
KITTI-360 and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our approach exceeds the
state-of-the-art in the PQ metric by 3.61 pp and 4.93 pp respectively.]]></summary>

entire mammalian brains at sub-micron resolution. These images offer the
potential to assemble brain-wide atlases of projection neuron morphology, but
manual neuron reconstruction remains a bottleneck. In this paper we present a
probabilistic method which combines a hidden Markov state process that encodes
neuron geometric properties with a random field appearance model of the
flourescence process. Our method utilizes dynamic programming to efficiently
compute the global maximizers of what we call the "most probable" neuron path.
We applied our algorithm to the output of image segmentation models where false
negatives severed neuronal processes, and showed that it can follow axons in
the presence of noise or nearby neurons. Our method has the potential to be
integrated into a semi or fully automated reconstruction pipeline.
Additionally, it creates a framework for conditioning the probability to fixed
start and endpoints through which users can intervene with hard constraints to,
for example, rule out certain reconstructions, or assign axons to particular
cell bodies.]]></summary>

arbitrary human poses and transferring poses of one person to others. However,
most existing approaches explicitly leverage the pose information extracted

Meanwhile, they usually focus on the visual fidelity of the synthesized images
but neglect the inherent consistency, which further confines their performance
of pose transfer. To alleviate the current limitations and improve the quality

of images containing the source and target person, DFC-Net extracts pose and
static information from the source and target respectively, then synthesizes an
image of the target person with the desired pose from the source. Moreover,
DFC-Net leverages disentangled feature consistency losses in the adversarial
training to strengthen the transfer coherence and integrates the keypoint
amplifier to enhance the pose feature extraction. Additionally, an unpaired
support dataset Mixamo-Sup providing more extra pose information has been
further utilized during the training to improve the generality and robustness

real-world applications, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and
human-computer interaction. Compared with the rapid development of deep
learning for two-dimensional (2D) image tasks, deep learning-based instance
segmentation of 3D point cloud still has a lot of room for development. In
particular, distinguishing a large number of occluded objects of the same class
is a highly challenging problem, which is seen in a robotic bin-picking. In a
usual bin-picking scene, many indentical objects are stacked together and the
model of the objects is known. Thus, the semantic information can be ignored;
instead, the focus in the bin-picking is put on the segmentation of instances.
Based on this task requirement, we propose a Fast Point Cloud Clustering (FPCC)
for instance segmentation of bin-picking scene. FPCC includes a network named
FPCC-Net and a fast clustering algorithm. FPCC-net has two subnets, one for
inferring the geometric centers for clustering and the other for describing
features of each point. FPCC-Net extracts features of each point and infers
geometric center points of each instance simultaneously. After that, the
proposed clustering algorithm clusters the remaining points to the closest
geometric center in feature embedding space. Experiments show that FPCC also
surpasses the existing works in bin-picking scenes and is more computationally
efficient. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/xyjbaal/FPCC.]]></summary>

difficult to analyse. As global approaches to feature comparison are limited in
this case, it is important to extend to consider local information. In this
work, we propose hand-based person identification by learning both global and
local deep feature representation. Our proposed method, Global and Part-Aware
Network (GPA-Net), creates global and local branches on the conv-layer for
learning robust discriminative global and part-level features. For learning the
local (part-level) features, we perform uniform partitioning on the conv-layer
in both horizontal and vertical directions. We retrieve the parts by conducting
a soft partition without explicitly partitioning the images or requiring
external cues such as pose estimation. We make extensive evaluations on two
large multi-ethnic and publicly available hand datasets, demonstrating that our
proposed method significantly outperforms competing approaches.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT)
due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one
map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests
near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from
compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As
the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent
this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical
significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach
based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the
subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step
approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly
recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the
photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic
forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet
transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are
formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily
overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of
the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed
sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA.
Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as
implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to
recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition
including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative
merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real
data in a fair and rigorous manner.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anomaly detection with weakly supervised video-level labels is typically
formulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, in which we aim to
identify snippets containing abnormal events, with each video represented as a
bag of video snippets. Although current methods show effective detection
performance, their recognition of the positive instances, i.e., rare abnormal
snippets in the abnormal videos, is largely biased by the dominant negative
instances, especially when the abnormal events are subtle anomalies that
exhibit only small differences compared with normal events. This issue is
exacerbated in many methods that ignore important video temporal dependencies.
To address this issue, we introduce a novel and theoretically sound method,
named Robust Temporal Feature Magnitude learning (RTFM), which trains a feature
magnitude learning function to effectively recognise the positive instances,
substantially improving the robustness of the MIL approach to the negative
instances from abnormal videos. RTFM also adapts dilated convolutions and
self-attention mechanisms to capture long- and short-range temporal
dependencies to learn the feature magnitude more faithfully. Extensive
experiments show that the RTFM-enabled MIL model (i) outperforms several
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on four benchmark data sets
(ShanghaiTech, UCF-Crime, XD-Violence and UCSD-Peds) and (ii) achieves
significantly improved subtle anomaly discriminability and sample efficiency.

portrait image generation. However, in the latent space learned by GANs,
different attributes, such as pose, shape, and texture style, are generally
entangled, making the explicit control of specific attributes difficult. To
address this issue, we propose a SofGAN image generator to decouple the latent
space of portraits into two subspaces: a geometry space and a texture space.
The latent codes sampled from the two subspaces are fed to two network branches
separately, one to generate the 3D geometry of portraits with canonical pose,
and the other to generate textures. The aligned 3D geometries also come with
semantic part segmentation, encoded as a semantic occupancy field (SOF). The
SOF allows the rendering of consistent 2D semantic segmentation maps at
arbitrary views, which are then fused with the generated texture maps and
stylized to a portrait photo using our semantic instance-wise (SIW) module.
Through extensive experiments, we show that our system can generate high
quality portrait images with independently controllable geometry and texture
attributes. The method also generalizes well in various applications such as
appearance-consistent facial animation and dynamic styling.]]></summary>

Its key novelty is an overlap-attention block for early information exchange
between the latent encodings of the two point clouds. In this way the
subsequent decoding of the latent representations into per-point features is
conditioned on the respective other point cloud, and thus can predict which
points are not only salient, but also lie in the overlap region between the two
point clouds. The ability to focus on points that are relevant for matching
greatly improves performance: PREDATOR raises the rate of successful
registrations by more than 20% in the low-overlap scenario, and also sets a new
state of the art for the 3DMatch benchmark with 89% registration recall.]]></summary>

have less sampling frequency and low-frequency variability due to which,

existing classification methods. It is extremely fast at training.
Nevertheless, it cannot perform face verification tasks properly because face
verification tasks require comparison of facial images of two individuals at
the same time and decide whether the two faces identify the same person. The
structure of Extreme Leaning Machine was not designed to feed two input data
streams simultaneously, thus, in 2-input scenarios Extreme Learning Machine
methods are normally applied using concatenated inputs. However, this setup
consumes two times more computational resources and it is not optimized for
recognition tasks where learning a separable distance metric is critical. For
these reasons, we propose and develop a Siamese Extreme Learning Machine
(SELM). SELM was designed to be fed with two data streams in parallel
simultaneously. It utilizes a dual-stream Siamese condition in the extra
Siamese layer to transform the data before passing it along to the hidden
layer. Moreover, we propose a Gender-Ethnicity-Dependent triplet feature
exclusively trained on a variety of specific demographic groups. This feature
enables learning and extracting of useful facial features of each group.
Experiments were conducted to evaluate and compare the performances of SELM,
Extreme Learning Machine, and DCNN. The experimental results showed that the
proposed feature was able to perform correct classification at 97.87% accuracy
and 99.45% AUC. They also showed that using SELM in conjunction with the
proposed feature provided 98.31% accuracy and 99.72% AUC. They outperformed the
well-known DCNN and Extreme Leaning Machine methods by a wide margin.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Domain adaptation (DA) has drawn high interest for its capacity to adapt a
model trained on labeled source data to perform well on unlabeled or weakly
labeled target data from a different domain. Most common DA techniques require
concurrent access to the input images of both the source and target domains.
However, in practice, privacy concerns often impede the availability of source
images in the adaptation phase. This is a very frequent DA scenario in medical
imaging, where, for instance, the source and target images could come from
different clinical sites. We introduce a source-free domain adaptation for
image segmentation. Our formulation is based on minimizing a label-free entropy
loss defined over target-domain data, which we further guide with a
domain-invariant prior on the segmentation regions. Many priors can be derived
from anatomical information. Here, a class ratio prior is estimated from
anatomical knowledge and integrated in the form of a Kullback Leibler (KL)
divergence in our overall loss function. Furthermore, we motivate our overall
loss with an interesting link to maximizing the mutual information between the
target images and their label predictions. We show the effectiveness of our
prior aware entropy minimization in a variety of domain-adaptation scenarios,
with different modalities and applications, including spine, prostate, and
cardiac segmentation. Our method yields comparable results to several state of
the art adaptation techniques, despite having access to much less information,
as the source images are entirely absent in our adaptation phase. Our
straightforward adaptation strategy uses only one network, contrary to popular
adversarial techniques, which are not applicable to a source-free DA setting.
Our framework can be readily used in a breadth of segmentation problems, and
our code is publicly available: https://github.com/mathilde-b/SFDA]]></summary>

life globally, and a critical factor in mitigating its effects is screening
individuals for infections, thereby allowing for both proper treatment for
those individuals as well as action to be taken to prevent further spread of
the virus. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) imaging has been proposed as a
screening tool as it is a much cheaper and easier to apply imaging modality
than others that are traditionally used for pulmonary examinations, namely
chest x-ray and computed tomography. Given the scarcity of expert radiologists
for interpreting POCUS examinations in many highly affected regions around the
world, low-cost deep learning-driven clinical decision support solutions can
have a large impact during the on-going pandemic. Motivated by this, we
introduce COVID-Net US, a highly efficient, self-attention deep convolutional
neural network design tailored for COVID-19 screening from lung POCUS images.
Experimental results show that the proposed COVID-Net US can achieve an AUC of
over 0.98 while achieving 353X lower architectural complexity, 62X lower
computational complexity, and 14.3X faster inference times on a Raspberry Pi.
Clinical validation was also conducted, where select cases were reviewed and
reported on by a practicing clinician (20 years of clinical practice)
specializing in intensive care (ICU) and 15 years of expertise in POCUS
interpretation. To advocate affordable healthcare and artificial intelligence
for resource-constrained environments, we have made COVID-Net US open source
and publicly available as part of the COVID-Net open source initiative.]]></summary>

object segmentation (VOS). Previous methods mainly focus on using simplex
solutions, lowering the upper bound of feature collaboration among and across

introduced to update the inconsistent features between the spatial-temporal

mutual restraint within the full-duplex strategy, our FSNet performs the
cross-modal feature-passing (i.e., transmission and receiving) simultaneously
before the fusion and decoding stage, making it robust to various challenging
scenarios (e.g., motion blur, occlusion) in VOS. Extensive experiments on five
popular benchmarks (i.e., DAVIS$_{16}$, FBMS, MCL, SegTrack-V2, and

pairs while maximizing that of negative ones, has been widely and successfully
applied in unsupervised feature learning, where the design of positive and
negative (pos/neg) pairs is one of its keys. In this paper, we attempt to
devise a feature-level data manipulation, differing from data augmentation, to
enhance the generic contrastive self-supervised learning. To this end, we first
design a visualization scheme for pos/neg score (Pos/neg score indicates cosine
similarity of pos/neg pair.) distribution, which enables us to analyze,
interpret and understand the learning process. To our knowledge, this is the
first attempt of its kind. More importantly, leveraging this tool, we gain some
significant observations, which inspire our novel Feature Transformation
proposals including the extrapolation of positives. This operation creates
harder positives to boost the learning because hard positives enable the model
to be more view-invariant. Besides, we propose the interpolation among
negatives, which provides diversified negatives and makes the model more
discriminative. It is the first attempt to deal with both challenges
simultaneously. Experiment results show that our proposed Feature
Transformation can improve at least 6.0% accuracy on ImageNet-100 over MoCo
baseline, and about 2.0% accuracy on ImageNet-1K over the MoCoV2 baseline.

and plays a key role in supplying the whole body with blood. Aortic diseases,
like aneurysms or dissections, can lead to an aortic rupture, whose treatment
with open surgery is highly risky. Therefore, patients commonly undergo drug
treatment under constant monitoring, which requires regular inspections of the
vessels through imaging. The standard imaging modality for diagnosis and
monitoring is computed tomography (CT), which can provide a detailed picture of
the aorta and its branching vessels if combined with a contrast agent,
resulting in a CT angiography (CTA). Optimally, the whole aortic vessel tree
geometry from consecutive CTAs, are overlaid and compared. This allows to not
only detect changes in the aorta, but also more peripheral vessel tree changes,
caused by the primary pathology or newly developed. When performed manually,
this reconstruction requires slice by slice contouring, which could easily take
a whole day for a single aortic vessel tree and, hence, is not feasible in
clinical practice. Automatic or semi-automatic vessel tree segmentation
algorithms, on the other hand, can complete this task in a fraction of the
manual execution time and run in parallel to the clinical routine of the
clinicians. In this paper, we systematically review computing techniques for
the automatic and semi-automatic segmentation of the aortic vessel tree. The
review concludes with an in-depth discussion on how close these
state-of-the-art approaches are to an application in clinical practice and how
active this research field is, taking into account the number of publications,
datasets and challenges.]]></summary>

sensing images, UAVs, etc. At present, most of the rotating object detection
datasets focus on the field of remote sensing, and these images are usually
shot in high-altitude scenes. However, image datasets captured at low-altitude
areas also should be concerned, such as drone-based datasets. So we present a
low-altitude dronebased dataset, named UAV-ROD, aiming to promote the research
and development in rotating object detection and UAV applications. The UAV-ROD
consists of 1577 images and 30,090 instances of car category annotated by
oriented bounding boxes. In particular, The UAV-ROD can be utilized for the
rotating object detection, vehicle orientation recognition and object counting
tasks. Compared with horizontal object detection, the regression stage of the
rotation detection is a tricky problem. In this paper, we propose a rotating
object detector TS4Net, which contains anchor refinement module (ARM) and
two-stage sample selective strategy (TS4). The ARM can convert preseted
horizontal anchors into high-quality rotated anchors through twostage anchor
refinement. The TS4 module utilizes different constrained sample selective
strategies to allocate positive and negative samples, which is adaptive to the
regression task in different stages. Benefiting from the ARM and TS4, the
TS4Net can achieve superior performance for rotating object detection solely
with one preseted horizontal anchor. Extensive experimental results on UAV-ROD
dataset and three remote sensing datasets DOTA, HRSC2016 and UCAS-AOD
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against most
state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

medical image analysis tasks such as segmentation. Post-processing and refining
the results of segmentation is a common practice to decrease the
misclassifications originating from the segmentation network. In addition to
widely used methods like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) which focus on the
structure of the segmented volume/area, a graph-based recent approach makes use
of certain and uncertain points in a graph and refines the segmentation
according to a small graph convolutional network (GCN). However, there are two
drawbacks of the approach: most of the edges in the graph are assigned randomly

these issues, we define a new neighbor-selection mechanism according to feature
distances and combine the two networks in the training procedure. According to
the experimental results on pancreas segmentation from Computed Tomography (CT)
images, we demonstrate improvement in the quantitative measures. Also,
examining the dynamic neighbors created by our method, edges between
semantically similar image parts are observed. The proposed method also shows
qualitative enhancements in the segmentation maps, as demonstrated in the

(CSVD-QR) method for matrix complete problem is presented, whose computational
complexity is $O(r^2(m+n))$, which is mainly due to that $r$ is far less than
$\min\{m,n\}$, where $r$ represents the largest number of singular values of
matrix $X$. What is particularly interesting is that after replacing the
nuclear norm with the $L_{2,1}$ norm proposed based on this decomposition, as
the upper bound of the nuclear norm, when the intermediate matrix $D$ in its
decomposition is close to the diagonal matrix, it will converge to the nuclear
norm, and is exactly equal, when the $D$ matrix is equal to the diagonal
matrix, to the nuclear norm, which ingeniously avoids the calculation of the
singular value of the matrix. To the best of our knowledge, there is no
literature to generalize and apply it to solve tensor complete problems.
Inspired by this, in this paper we propose a class of tensor minimization model
based on $L_{2,1}$ norm and CSVD-QR method for the tensor complete problem,
which is convex and therefore has a global minimum solution.]]></summary>

Experiments are performed on the Oulu-CASIA dataset and the performance is
compared to other works in FER. The results indicate that our method achieves

patterns for interstitial pneumonia, as a point-of-care tool for both patients
with COVID-19 and other community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In this work, we
focus on the hyperechoic B-line segmentation task. Using deep neural networks,
we automatically outline the regions that are indicative of pathology-sensitive
artifacts and their associated sonographic patterns. With a real-world
data-scarce scenario, we investigate approaches to utilize both COVID-19 and
CAP lung ultrasound data to train the networks; comparing fine-tuning and
unsupervised domain adaptation. Segmenting either type of lung condition at
inference may support a range of clinical applications during evolving epidemic
stages, but also demonstrates value in resource-constrained clinical scenarios.
Adapting real clinical data acquired from COVID-19 patients to those from CAP
patients significantly improved Dice scores from 0.60 to 0.87 (p < 0.001) and
from 0.43 to 0.71 (p < 0.001), on independent COVID-19 and CAP test cases,
respectively. It is of practical value that the improvement was demonstrated
with only a small amount of data in both training and adaptation data sets, a
common constraint for deploying machine learning models in clinical practice.
Interestingly, we also report that the inverse adaptation, from labelled CAP
data to unlabeled COVID-19 data, did not demonstrate an improvement when tested
on either condition. Furthermore, we offer a possible explanation that
correlates the segmentation performance to label consistency and data domain
diversity in this point-of-care lung ultrasound application.]]></summary>

between synthetic training data and real-world testing images usually leads to
degradation of existing methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel
image dehazing framework collaborating with unlabeled real data. First, we
develop a disentangled image dehazing network (DID-Net), which disentangles the
feature representations into three component maps, i.e. the latent haze-free
image, the transmission map, and the global atmospheric light estimate,
respecting the physical model of a haze process. Our DID-Net predicts the three
component maps by progressively integrating features across scales, and refines
each map by passing an independent refinement network. Then a
disentangled-consistency mean-teacher network (DMT-Net) is employed to
collaborate unlabeled real data for boosting single image dehazing.
Specifically, we encourage the coarse predictions and refinements of each
disentangled component to be consistent between the student and teacher
networks by using a consistency loss on unlabeled real data. We make comparison
with 13 state-of-the-art dehazing methods on a new collected dataset (Haze4K)
and two widely-used dehazing datasets (i.e., SOTS and HazeRD), as well as on
real-world hazy images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method has

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Labeling is onerous for crowd counting as it should annotate each individual
in crowd images. Recently, several methods have been proposed for
semi-supervised crowd counting to reduce the labeling efforts. Given a limited
labeling budget, they typically select a few crowd images and densely label all
individuals in each of them. Despite the promising results, we argue the
None-or-All labeling strategy is suboptimal as the densely labeled individuals
in each crowd image usually appear similar while the massive unlabeled crowd
images may contain entirely diverse individuals. To this end, we propose to
break the labeling chain of previous methods and make the first attempt to
reduce spatial labeling redundancy for semi-supervised crowd counting. First,
instead of annotating all the regions in each crowd image, we propose to
annotate the representative ones only. We analyze the region representativeness
from both vertical and horizontal directions, and formulate them as cluster
centers of Gaussian Mixture Models. Additionally, to leverage the rich
unlabeled regions, we exploit the similarities among individuals in each crowd
image to directly supervise the unlabeled regions via feature propagation
instead of the error-prone label propagation employed in the previous methods.
In this way, we can transfer the original spatial labeling redundancy caused by
individual similarities to effective supervision signals on the unlabeled
regions. Extensive experiments on the widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that
our method can outperform previous best approaches by a large margin.]]></summary>

mechanism treats the spatial transformation as the message passing process, and
the relation between the view poses and the routing weights is modeled by an
end-to-end trainable neural network. Besides, an Occupancy Concept Mapping

proposed STR mechanism improves the performance of the Generative Query Network

encoder, a CNN decoder and a simple classifier (separating foreground and
background pixels). Most existing methods meta-learn all three model components
for fast adaptation to a new class. However, given that as few as a single
support set image is available, effective model adaption of all three
components to the new class is extremely challenging. In this work we propose
to simplify the meta-learning task by focusing solely on the simplest
component, the classifier, whilst leaving the encoder and decoder to
pre-training. We hypothesize that if we pre-train an off-the-shelf segmentation
model over a set of diverse training classes with sufficient annotations, the
encoder and decoder can capture rich discriminative features applicable for any
unseen classes, rendering the subsequent meta-learning stage unnecessary. For
the classifier meta-learning, we introduce a Classifier Weight Transformer
(CWT) designed to dynamically adapt the supportset trained classifier's weights
to each query image in an inductive way. Extensive experiments on two standard

making the process too computationally expensive. To overcome these, in this
paper, we look at NAS from a novel point of view and introduce Learning to Rank
(LTR) methods to select the best (ace) architectures from a space.
Specifically, we propose to use Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) as
the target metric and LambdaRank as the training algorithm. We also propose to
leverage weak supervision from weight sharing by pretraining architecture
representation on weak labels obtained from the super-net and then finetuning
the ranking model using a small number of architectures trained from scratch.
Extensive experiments on NAS benchmarks and large-scale search spaces
demonstrate that our approach outperforms SOTA with a significantly reduced
search cost.]]></summary>

however they require a huge amount of labeled data for their optimization.
Hence, domain adaptation approaches have come into play to transfer knowledge
acquired on a label-abundant source domain to a related label-scarce target
domain. However, such models do not generalize well to data with statistical
properties not perfectly matching the ones of the training samples. In this
work, we design and carefully analyze multiple latent space-shaping
regularization strategies that work in conjunction to reduce the domain
discrepancy in semantic segmentation. In particular, we devise a feature
clustering strategy to increase domain alignment, a feature perpendicularity
constraint to space apart feature belonging to different semantic classes,
including those not present in the current batch, and a feature norm alignment
strategy to separate active and inactive channels. Additionally, we propose a
novel performance metric to capture the relative efficacy of an adaptation
strategy compared to supervised training. We verify the effectiveness of our
framework in synthetic-to-real and real-to-real adaptation scenarios,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple road scenes
benchmarks and using different backbones.]]></summary>

issues, e.g., undernutrition, obesity and many non-communicable diseases. An
indispensable part of the health diet is dietary assessment. Traditional manual
recording methods are burdensome and contain substantial biases and errors.
Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence, especially computer vision
technologies, have made it possible to develop automatic dietary assessment
solutions, which are more convenient, less time-consuming and even more
accurate to monitor daily food intake.

Scope and approach: This review presents one unified Vision-Based Dietary
Assessment (VBDA) framework, which generally consists of three stages: food
image analysis, volume estimation and nutrient derivation. Vision-based food
analysis methods, including food recognition, detection and segmentation, are
systematically summarized, and methods of volume estimation and nutrient
derivation are also given. The prosperity of deep learning makes VBDA gradually
move to an end-to-end implementation, which applies food images to a single
network to directly estimate the nutrition. The recently proposed end-to-end
methods are also discussed. We further analyze existing dietary assessment
datasets, indicating that one large-scale benchmark is urgently needed, and
finally highlight key challenges and future trends for VBDA.

Key findings and conclusions: After thorough exploration, we find that
multi-task end-to-end deep learning approaches are one important trend of VBDA.
Despite considerable research progress, many challenges remain for VBDA due to
the meal complexity. We also provide the latest ideas for future development of
VBDA, e.g., fine-grained food analysis and accurate volume estimation. This
survey aims to encourage researchers to propose more practical solutions for
VBDA.]]></summary>

gastrointestinal (GI) tract of patients to capture lesion areas. However, it
takes the clinicians excessive time to review a large number of images
extracted from colonoscopy videos. Thus, automatic detection of biological
anatomical landmarks within the colon is highly demanded, which can help reduce
the burden of clinicians by providing guidance information for the locations of
lesion areas. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning-based approach
to detect biological anatomical landmarks in colonoscopy videos. First, raw
colonoscopy video sequences are pre-processed to reject interference frames.
Second, a ResNet-101 based network is used to detect three biological
anatomical landmarks separately to obtain the intermediate detection results.
Third, to achieve more reliable localization of the landmark periods within the
whole video period, we propose to post-process the intermediate detection
results by identifying the incorrectly predicted frames based on their temporal
distribution and reassigning them back to the correct class. Finally, the
average detection accuracy reaches 99.75\%. Meanwhile, the average IoU of 0.91
shows a high degree of similarity between our predicted landmark periods and
ground truth. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model is
capable of accurately detecting and localizing biological anatomical landmarks
from colonoscopy videos.]]></summary>

increasing because of its simple system configuration and ability of capturing

propose a technique to recover high-frequency shapes by using shading

light with single camera. Since color image comprises shading information of
object surface, high-frequency shapes can be recovered by shape from shading
techniques. Although multiple images with different lighting positions are
required for shape from shading techniques, we propose a learning based
approach to recover shape from a single image. In addition, to overcome the
problem of preparing sufficient amount of data for training, we propose a new

scene while being lightweight.

Unfortunately, 3D meshes are mathematically difficult to handle directly
because of their combinatorial and discrete nature.

Therefore, most approaches generate 3D meshes of a scene after fusing depth
data using volumetric or other representations.

Nevertheless, volumetric fusion remains computationally expensive both in
terms of speed and memory.

In this paper, we leapfrog these intermediate representations and build a 3D
mesh directly from a depth map and the sparse landmarks triangulated with
visual odometry.

To this end, we formulate a non-smooth convex optimization problem that we
solve using a primal-dual method.

Our approach generates a smooth and accurate 3D mesh that substantially
improves the state-of-the-art on direct mesh reconstruction while running in
real-time.]]></summary>

visibility, smoke, dusty, and dense fog environment. However tapping the
potential of radar sensing to reconstruct 3D object shapes remains a great
challenge, due to the characteristics of radar data such as sparsity, low
resolution, specularity, high noise, and multi-path induced shadow reflections
and artifacts. In this paper we propose 3D Reconstruction and Imaging via
mmWave Radar (3DRIMR), a deep learning based architecture that reconstructs 3D
shape of an object in dense detailed point cloud format, based on sparse raw
mmWave radar intensity data. The architecture consists of two back-to-back
conditional GAN deep neural networks: the first generator network generates 2D
depth images based on raw radar intensity data, and the second generator
network outputs 3D point clouds based on the results of the first generator.
The architecture exploits both convolutional neural network's convolutional
operation (that extracts local structure neighborhood information) and the
efficiency and detailed geometry capture capability of point clouds (other than
costly voxelization of 3D space or distance fields). Our experiments have
demonstrated 3DRIMR's effectiveness in reconstructing 3D objects, and its
performance improvement over standard techniques.]]></summary>

our semantic segmentation method uses two streams, which are combined through
an attention gate, forming an end-to-end Y-model. To the best of our knowledge,
ours is the first work to show that boundary detection can improve semantic
segmentation when fused through a semantic fusion gate (attention model). We
performed an extensive evaluation of our method over public data sets. We found
competitive results on all data sets after comparing our proposed model with

domain adaptation (FS-UDA), which has not been sufficiently studied in the
literature. In this setting, the source domain data are labelled, but with
few-shot per category, while the target domain data are unlabelled. To address
the FS-UDA setting, we develop a general UDA model to solve the following two
key issues: the few-shot labeled data per category and the domain adaptation
between support and query sets. Our model is general in that once trained it
will be able to be applied to various FS-UDA tasks from the same source and
target domains. Inspired by the recent local descriptor based few-shot learning
(FSL), our general UDA model is fully built upon local descriptors (LDs) for
image classification and domain adaptation. By proposing a novel concept called
similarity patterns (SPs), our model not only effectively considers the spatial
relationship of LDs that was ignored in previous FSL methods, but also makes
the learned image similarity better serve the required domain alignment.
Specifically, we propose a novel IMage-to-class sparse Similarity Encoding
(IMSE) method. It learns SPs to extract the local discriminative information
for classification and meanwhile aligns the covariance matrix of the SPs for
domain adaptation. Also, domain adversarial training and multi-scale local
feature matching are performed upon LDs. Extensive experiments conducted on a
multi-domain benchmark dataset DomainNet demonstrates the state-of-the-art
performance of our IMSE for the novel setting of FS-UDA. In addition, for FSL,
our IMSE can also show better performance than most of recent FSL methods on
miniImageNet.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Existing domain adaptation methods for crowd counting view each crowd image
as a whole and reduce domain discrepancies on crowds and backgrounds
simultaneously. However, we argue that these methods are suboptimal, as crowds
and backgrounds have quite different characteristics and backgrounds may vary
dramatically in different crowd scenes (see Fig.~\ref{teaser}). This makes
crowds not well aligned across domains together with backgrounds in a holistic
manner. To this end, we propose to untangle crowds and backgrounds from crowd
images and design fine-grained domain adaption methods for crowd counting.
Different from other tasks which possess region-based fine-grained annotations
(e.g., segments or bounding boxes), crowd counting only annotates one point on
each human head, which impedes the implementation of fine-grained adaptation
methods. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective schema to learn
crowd segmentation from point-level crowd counting annotations in the context
of Multiple Instance Learning. We further leverage the derived segments to
propose a crowd-aware fine-grained domain adaptation framework for crowd
counting, which consists of two novel adaptation modules, i.e., Crowd Region
Transfer (CRT) and Crowd Density Alignment (CDA). Specifically, the CRT module
is designed to guide crowd features transfer across domains beyond background
distractions, and the CDA module dedicates to constraining the target-domain
crowd density distributions. Extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain
settings (i.e., Synthetic $\rightarrow$ Real, Fixed $\rightarrow$ Fickle,
Normal $\rightarrow$ BadWeather) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
method compared with state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

computer-aided diagnosis systems for many applications. However, given many
disparate imaging modalities and inherent variations in the patient data, it is
difficult to consistently achieve high accuracy using modern deep neural
networks (DNNs). This has led researchers to propose interactive image
segmentation techniques where a medical expert can interactively correct the
output of a DNN to the desired accuracy. However, these techniques often need
separate training data with the associated human interactions, and do not
generalize to various diseases, and types of medical images. In this paper, we
suggest a novel conditional inference technique for DNNs which takes the
intervention by a medical expert as test time constraints and performs
inference conditioned upon these constraints. Our technique is generic can be
used for medical images from any modality. Unlike other methods, our approach
can correct multiple structures simultaneously and add structures missed at
initial segmentation. We report an improvement of 13.3, 12.5, 17.8, 10.2, and
12.4 times in user annotation time than full human annotation for the nucleus,
multiple cells, liver and tumor, organ, and brain segmentation respectively. We
report a time saving of 2.8, 3.0, 1.9, 4.4, and 8.6 fold compared to other
interactive segmentation techniques. Our method can be useful to clinicians for
diagnosis and post-surgical follow-up with minimal intervention from the
medical expert. The source-code and the detailed results are available here

this paper, we analyze CLIP and highlight some of the challenges such models

opening up many niche tasks to automation. CLIP also allows its users to
flexibly specify image classification classes in natural language, which we
find can shift how biases manifest. Additionally, through some preliminary
probes we find that CLIP can inherit biases found in prior computer vision
systems. Given the wide and unpredictable domain of uses for such models, this
raises questions regarding what sufficiently safe behaviour for such systems
may look like. These results add evidence to the growing body of work calling
for a change in the notion of a 'better' model--to move beyond simply looking
at higher accuracy at task-oriented capability evaluations, and towards a
broader 'better' that takes into account deployment-critical features such as
different use contexts, and people who interact with the model when thinking

pristine landscapes and its top-rated unique food and drink. Among thousands of
Vietnamese dishes, foreigners and native people are interested in easy-to-eat
tastes and easy-to-do recipes, along with reasonable prices, mouthwatering
flavors, and popularity. Due to the diversity and almost all the dishes have
significant similarities and the lack of quality Vietnamese food datasets, it
is hard to implement an auto system to classify Vietnamese food, therefore,
make people easier to discover Vietnamese food. This paper introduces a new
Vietnamese food dataset named VinaFood21, which consists of 13,950 images
corresponding to 21 dishes. We use 10,044 images for model training and 6,682
test images to classify each food in the VinaFood21 dataset and achieved an
average accuracy of 74.81% when fine-tuning CNN EfficientNet-B0.

increased immensely over the past few years. Open source libraries such as
HuggingFace have made these models easily available and accessible. While prior
research has identified biases in large language models, this paper considers
biases contained in the most popular versions of these models when applied
`out-of-the-box' for downstream tasks. We focus on generative language models
as they are well-suited for extracting biases inherited from training data.
Specifically, we conduct an in-depth analysis of GPT-2, which is the most
downloaded text generation model on HuggingFace, with over half a million
downloads in the past month alone. We assess biases related to occupational
associations for different protected categories by intersecting gender with
religion, sexuality, ethnicity, political affiliation, and continental name
origin. Using a template-based data collection pipeline, we collect 396K
sentence completions made by GPT-2 and find: (i) The machine-predicted jobs are
less diverse and more stereotypical for women than for men, especially for
intersections; (ii) Intersectional interactions are highly relevant for
occupational associations, which we quantify by fitting 262 logistic models;
(iii) For most occupations, GPT-2 reflects the skewed gender and ethnicity
distribution found in US Labour Bureau data, and even pulls the
societally-skewed distribution towards gender parity in cases where its
predictions deviate from real labor market observations. This raises the
normative question of what language models _should_ learn - whether they should
reflect or correct for existing inequalities.]]></summary>

part of Document Intelligence. Due to the complexity of content and layout in
VRDs, structured text understanding has been a challenging task. Most existing
studies decoupled this problem into two sub-tasks: entity labeling and entity
linking, which require an entire understanding of the context of documents at
both token and segment levels. However, little work has been concerned with the
solutions that efficiently extract the structured data from different levels.
This paper proposes a unified framework named StrucTexT, which is flexible and
effective for handling both sub-tasks. Specifically, based on the transformer,
we introduce a segment-token aligned encoder to deal with the entity labeling
and entity linking tasks at different levels of granularity. Moreover, we
design a novel pre-training strategy with three self-supervised tasks to learn
a richer representation. StrucTexT uses the existing Masked Visual Language
Modeling task and the new Sentence Length Prediction and Paired Boxes Direction
tasks to incorporate the multi-modal information across text, image, and
layout. We evaluate our method for structured text understanding at
segment-level and token-level and show it outperforms the state-of-the-art
counterparts with significantly superior performance on the FUNSD, SROIE, and

understanding, making Zero-Shot Action Recognition (ZSAR) a thriving direction.
The ZSAR task aims to recognize target (unseen) actions without training
examples by leveraging semantic representations to bridge seen and unseen
actions. However, due to the complexity and diversity of actions, it remains
challenging to semantically represent action classes and transfer knowledge
from seen data. In this work, we propose an ER-enhanced ZSAR model inspired by
an effective human memory technique Elaborative Rehearsal (ER), which involves
elaborating a new concept and relating it to known concepts. Specifically, we
expand each action class as an Elaborative Description (ED) sentence, which is
more discriminative than a class name and less costly than manual-defined
attributes. Besides directly aligning class semantics with videos, we
incorporate objects from the video as Elaborative Concepts (EC) to improve
video semantics and generalization from seen actions to unseen actions. Our
ER-enhanced ZSAR model achieves state-of-the-art results on three existing
benchmarks. Moreover, we propose a new ZSAR evaluation protocol on the Kinetics
dataset to overcome limitations of current benchmarks and demonstrate the first
case where ZSAR performance is comparable to few-shot learning baselines on
this more realistic setting. We will release our codes and collected EDs at

the query and document are encoded through BERT's self-attention layers -
bi-encoder versus cross-encoder. Bi-encoder models are highly efficient because
all the documents can be pre-processed before the query time, but their
performance is inferior compared to cross-encoder models. Both models utilize a
ranker that receives BERT representations as the input and generates a
relevance score as the output. In this work, we propose a method where
multi-teacher distillation is applied to a cross-encoder NRM and a bi-encoder
NRM to produce a bi-encoder NRM with two rankers. The resulting student
bi-encoder achieves an improved performance by simultaneously learning from a
cross-encoder teacher and a bi-encoder teacher and also by combining relevance
scores from the two rankers. We call this method TRMD (Two Rankers and
Multi-teacher Distillation). In the experiments, TwinBERT and ColBERT are
considered as baseline bi-encoders. When monoBERT is used as the cross-encoder
teacher, together with either TwinBERT or ColBERT as the bi-encoder teacher,
TRMD produces a student bi-encoder that performs better than the corresponding
baseline bi-encoder. For P@20, the maximum improvement was 11.4%, and the
average improvement was 6.8%. As an additional experiment, we considered
producing cross-encoder students with TRMD, and found that it could also
improve the cross-encoders.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, many deep learning models have been adopted in autonomous
driving. At the same time, these models introduce new vulnerabilities that may
compromise the safety of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, recent studies have
demonstrated that adversarial attacks can cause a significant decline in
detection precision of deep learning-based 3D object detection models. Although
driving safety is the ultimate concern for autonomous driving, there is no
comprehensive study on the linkage between the performance of deep learning
models and the driving safety of autonomous vehicles under adversarial attacks.
In this paper, we investigate the impact of two primary types of adversarial
attacks, perturbation attacks and patch attacks, on the driving safety of
vision-based autonomous vehicles rather than the detection precision of deep
learning models. In particular, we consider two state-of-the-art models in
vision-based 3D object detection, Stereo R-CNN and DSGN. To evaluate driving
safety, we propose an end-to-end evaluation framework with a set of driving
safety performance metrics. By analyzing the results of our extensive
evaluation experiments, we find that (1) the attack's impact on the driving
safety of autonomous vehicles and the attack's impact on the precision of 3D
object detectors are decoupled, and (2) the DSGN model demonstrates stronger
robustness to adversarial attacks than the Stereo R-CNN model. In addition, we
further investigate the causes behind the two findings with an ablation study.
The findings of this paper provide a new perspective to evaluate adversarial
attacks and guide the selection of deep learning models in autonomous driving.]]></summary>

generalization from a single source. The goal is to learn a robust model from a
single source and expect it to generalize over many unknown distributions. This
challenging problem has been seldom investigated while existing solutions
suffer from various limitations such as the ignorance of uncertainty assessment
and label augmentation. In this paper, we propose uncertainty-guided domain
generalization to tackle the aforementioned limitations. The key idea is to
augment the source capacity in both feature and label spaces, while the
augmentation is guided by uncertainty assessment. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work to (1) quantify the generalization uncertainty from a
single source and (2) leverage it to guide both feature and label augmentation
for robust generalization. The model training and deployment are effectively
organized in a Bayesian meta-learning framework. We conduct extensive
comparisons and ablation study to validate our approach. The results prove our
superior performance in a wide scope of tasks including image classification,
semantic segmentation, text classification, and speech recognition.]]></summary>

with limited data. However, the resulting models could be unnecessarily large
and thus inefficient. Although network pruning can be applied to improve
inference efficiency, existing algorithms usually require fine-tuning and may
not be suitable for small datasets. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that
transforms the convolutional weights into the subspaces of orthonormal bases
where a model is pruned. Using singular value decomposition, we decompose a
convolutional layer into two layers: a convolutional layer with the orthonormal
basis vectors as the filters, and a layer that we name "BasisScalingConv",
which is responsible for rescaling the features and transforming them back to
the original space. As the filters in each transformed layer are linearly
independent with known relative importance, pruning can be more effective and
stable, and fine tuning individual weights is unnecessary. Furthermore, as the
numbers of input and output channels of the original convolutional layer remain
unchanged, basis pruning is applicable to virtually all network architectures.
Basis pruning can also be combined with existing pruning algorithms for double
pruning to further increase the pruning capability. With less than 1% reduction
in the classification accuracy, we can achieve pruning ratios up to 98.9% in
parameters and 98.6% in FLOPs.]]></summary>

query one from a database. A common image retrieval practice is to firstly
retrieve candidate images via similarity search using global image features and
then re-rank the candidates by leveraging their local features. Previous
learning-based studies mainly focus on either global or local image
representation learning to tackle the retrieval task. In this paper, we abandon
the two-stage paradigm and seek to design an effective single-stage solution by
integrating local and global information inside images into compact image
representations. Specifically, we propose a Deep Orthogonal Local and Global
(DOLG) information fusion framework for end-to-end image retrieval. It
attentively extracts representative local information with multi-atrous
convolutions and self-attention at first. Components orthogonal to the global
image representation are then extracted from the local information. At last,
the orthogonal components are concatenated with the global representation as a
complementary, and then aggregation is performed to generate the final
representation. The whole framework is end-to-end differentiable and can be
trained with image-level labels. Extensive experimental results validate the
effectiveness of our solution and show that our model achieves state-of-the-art
image retrieval performances on Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.]]></summary>

super-resolution (STVSR) heavily rely on a large-scale external dataset
consisting of paired low-resolution low-frame rate (LR-LFR)and high-resolution
high-frame-rate (HR-HFR) videos. Despite their remarkable performance, these
methods make a prior assumption that the low-resolution video is obtained by
down-scaling the high-resolution video using a known degradation kernel, which
does not hold in practical settings. Another problem with these methods is that
they cannot exploit instance-specific internal information of video at testing
time. Recently, deep internal learning approaches have gained attention due to
their ability to utilize the instance-specific statistics of a video. However,
these methods have a large inference time as they require thousands of gradient
updates to learn the intrinsic structure of the data. In this work, we
presentAdaptiveVideoSuper-Resolution (Ada-VSR) which leverages external, as
well as internal, information through meta-transfer learning and internal
learning, respectively. Specifically, meta-learning is employed to obtain
adaptive parameters, using a large-scale external dataset, that can adapt
quickly to the novel condition (degradation model) of the given test video
during the internal learning task, thereby exploiting external and internal
information of a video for super-resolution. The model trained using our
approach can quickly adapt to a specific video condition with only a few
gradient updates, which reduces the inference time significantly. Extensive
experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that our method performs favorably
against various state-of-the-art approaches.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lifespan face synthesis (LFS) model aims to generate a set of
photo-realistic face images of a person's whole life, given only one snapshot
as reference. The generated face image given a target age code is expected to
be age-sensitive reflected by bio-plausible transformations of shape and
texture, while being identity preserving. This is extremely challenging because
the shape and texture characteristics of a face undergo separate and highly
nonlinear transformations w.r.t. age. Most recent LFS models are based on
generative adversarial networks (GANs) whereby age code conditional
transformations are applied to a latent face representation. They benefit
greatly from the recent advancements of GANs. However, without explicitly
disentangling their latent representations into the texture, shape and identity
factors, they are fundamentally limited in modeling the nonlinear age-related
transformation on texture and shape whilst preserving identity. In this work, a
novel LFS model is proposed to disentangle the key face characteristics
including shape, texture and identity so that the unique shape and texture age
transformations can be modeled effectively. This is achieved by extracting
shape, texture and identity features separately from an encoder. Critically,
two transformation modules, one conditional convolution based and the other
channel attention based, are designed for modeling the nonlinear shape and
texture feature transformations respectively. This is to accommodate their
rather distinct aging processes and ensure that our synthesized images are both
age-sensitive and identity preserving. Extensive experiments show that our LFS
model is clearly superior to the state-of-the-art alternatives. Codes and demo
are available on our project website:

bidding system is becoming paramount for the success of e-commerce companies.
The critical challenges faced by a modern industrial-level bidding system

high sparsity; 2. the large volume of bidding requests induces significant
computation burden to both the offline and online serving. Leveraging
extraneous user-item information proves essential to mitigate the sparsity
issue, for which we exploit the natural language signals from the users' query
and the contextual knowledge from the products. In particular, we extract the
vector representations of ads via the Transformer model and leverage their
geometric relation to building collaborative bidding predictions via
clustering. The two-step procedure also significantly reduces the computation
stress of bid evaluation and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the
end-to-end structure of the bidding system for search engine marketing for
Walmart e-commerce, which successfully handles tens of millions of bids each

before traditional news outlets cover them. The real-time analysis of posts on

adaptive stream with a digestible but diverse selection of recent posts related
to relevant topics. We also integrate familiar visual metaphors that are highly
interlinked for enabling both explorative and more focused monitoring tasks.
Analysts can gradually increase the resolution to dive deeper into particular
topics. In contrast to previous work, our system also works with non-geolocated
posts and avoids extensive preprocessing such as detecting events. We evaluated
our dynamic clustering algorithm and discuss several use cases that show the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hybrid recommendations have recently attracted a lot of attention where user
features are utilized as auxiliary information to address the sparsity problem
caused by insufficient user-item interactions. However, extracted user features
generally contain rich multimodal information, and most of them are irrelevant
to the recommendation purpose. Therefore, excessive reliance on these features
will make the model overfit on noise and difficult to generalize. In this
article, we propose a variational bandwidth auto-encoder (VBAE) for
recommendations, aiming to address the sparsity and noise problems
simultaneously. VBAE first encodes user collaborative and feature information
into Gaussian latent variables via deep neural networks to capture non-linear
user similarities. Moreover, by considering the fusion of collaborative and
feature variables as a virtual communication channel from an
information-theoretic perspective, we introduce a user-dependent channel to
dynamically control the information allowed to be accessed from the feature
embeddings. A quantum-inspired uncertainty measurement of the hidden rating
embeddings is proposed accordingly to infer the channel bandwidth by
disentangling the uncertainty information in the ratings from the semantic
information. Through this mechanism, VBAE incorporates adequate auxiliary
information from user features if collaborative information is insufficient,
while avoiding excessive reliance on noisy user features to improve its
generalization ability to new users. Extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Codes
and datasets are released at https://github.com/yaochenzhu/vbae.]]></summary>

isolation plan to prevent its spread. Recently, transfer learning has been used
for Covid-19 detection using X-ray, ultrasound, and CT scans. One of the major
limitations inherent to these proposed methods is limited labeled dataset size
that affects the reliability of Covid-19 diagnosis and disease progression. In
this work, we demonstrate that how we can augment limited X-ray images data by
using Contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) to train the
last layer of the pre-trained deep learning models to mitigate the bias of
transfer learning for Covid-19 detection. We transfer learned various
pre-trained deep learning models including AlexNet, ZFNet, VGG-16, ResNet-18,
and GoogLeNet, and fine-tune the last layer by using CLAHE-augmented dataset.
The experiment results reveal that the CLAHE-based augmentation to various
pre-trained deep learning models significantly improves the model efficiency.
The pre-trained VCG-16 model with CLAHEbased augmented images achieves a
sensitivity of 95% using 15 epochs. AlexNet works show good sensitivity when
trained on non-augmented data. Other models demonstrate a value of less than
60% when trained on non-augmented data. Our results reveal that the sample bias
can negatively impact the performance of transfer learning which is
significantly improved by using CLAHE-based augmentation.]]></summary>

Multi-temporal oblique photogrammetry images are collected with 3D point clouds

for diabetic retinopathy prevention. Automated segmentation of fundus
photographs would improve the quality, capacity, and cost-effectiveness of eye
care screening programs. However, current segmentation methods are not robust
towards the diversity in imaging conditions and pathologies typical for
real-world clinical applications. To overcome these limitations, we utilized
contrastive self-supervised learning to exploit the large variety of unlabeled
fundus images in the publicly available EyePACS dataset. We pre-trained an
encoder of a U-Net, which we later fine-tuned on several retinal vessel and
lesion segmentation datasets. We demonstrate for the first time that by using
contrastive self-supervised learning, the pre-trained network can recognize
blood vessels, optic disc, fovea, and various lesions without being provided
any labels. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on a downstream blood vessel
segmentation task, such pre-trained networks achieve state-of-the-art
performance on images from different datasets. Additionally, the pre-training
also leads to shorter training times and an improved few-shot performance on
both blood vessel and lesion segmentation tasks. Altogether, our results
showcase the benefits of contrastive self-supervised pre-training which can
play a crucial role in real-world clinical applications requiring robust models
able to adapt to new devices with only a few annotated samples.]]></summary>

it has affected the healthy development of the Internet and can have negative
effects in society. While research in the sexism detection domain is growing,
most of this research focuses on English as the language and on Twitter as the
platform. Our objective here is to broaden the scope of this research by
considering the Chinese language on Sina Weibo. We propose the first Chinese
sexism dataset -- Sina Weibo Sexism Review (SWSR) dataset --, as well as a
large Chinese lexicon SexHateLex made of abusive and gender-related terms. We
introduce our data collection and annotation process, and provide an
exploratory analysis of the dataset characteristics to validate its quality and
to show how sexism is manifested in Chinese. The SWSR dataset provides labels
at different levels of granularity including (i) sexism or non-sexism, (ii)
sexism category and (iii) target type, which can be exploited, among others,
for building computational methods to identify and investigate finer-grained
gender-related abusive language. We conduct experiments for the three sexism
classification tasks making use of state-of-the-art machine learning models.
Our results show competitive performance, providing a benchmark for sexism
detection in the Chinese language, as well as an error analysis highlighting
open challenges needing more research in Chinese NLP. The SWSR dataset and
SexHateLex lexicon are publicly available.]]></summary>

intelligence (AI), enabling researchers to devise cognitive AI systems and
affords an intuitive means for users to interact with the robot. Of note,
communication plays a central role. To date, prior studies in embodied agent
navigation have only demonstrated that human languages facilitate communication
by instructions in natural languages. Nevertheless, a plethora of other forms
of communication is left unexplored. In fact, human communication originated in
gestures and oftentimes is delivered through multimodal cues, e.g. "go there"
with a pointing gesture. To bridge the gap and fill in the missing dimension of
communication in embodied agent navigation, we propose investigating the
effects of using gestures as the communicative interface instead of verbal
cues. Specifically, we develop a VR-based 3D simulation environment, named
Ges-THOR, based on AI2-THOR platform. In this virtual environment, a human
player is placed in the same virtual scene and shepherds the artificial agent
using only gestures. The agent is tasked to solve the navigation problem guided
by natural gestures with unknown semantics; we do not use any predefined
gestures due to the diversity and versatile nature of human gestures. We argue
that learning the semantics of natural gestures is mutually beneficial to
learning the navigation task--learn to communicate and communicate to learn. In
a series of experiments, we demonstrate that human gesture cues, even without
predefined semantics, improve the object-goal navigation for an embodied agent,
outperforming various state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sentence semantic matching requires an agent to determine the semantic
relation between two sentences, which is widely used in various natural
language tasks, such as Natural Language Inference (NLI), Paraphrase
Identification (PI), and so on. Much recent progress has been made in this
area, especially attention-based methods and pre-trained language model based
methods. However, most of these methods focus on all the important parts in
sentences in a static way and only emphasize how important the words are to the
query, inhibiting the ability of attention mechanism. In order to overcome this
problem and boost the performance of attention mechanism, we propose a novel
dynamic re-read attention, which can pay close attention to one small region of
sentences at each step and re-read the important parts for better sentence
representations. Based on this attention variation, we develop a novel Dynamic
Re-read Network (DRr-Net) for sentence semantic matching. Moreover, selecting
one small region in dynamic re-read attention seems insufficient for sentence
semantics, and employing pre-trained language models as input encoders will
introduce incomplete and fragile representation problems. To this end, we
extend DRrNet to Locally-Aware Dynamic Re-read Attention Net (LadRa-Net), in
which local structure of sentences is employed to alleviate the shortcoming of
Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) in pre-trained language models and boost the
performance of dynamic reread attention. Extensive experiments on two popular
sentence semantic matching tasks demonstrate that DRr-Net can significantly
improve the performance of sentence semantic matching. Meanwhile, LadRa-Net is
able to achieve better performance by considering the local structures of
sentences. In addition, it is exceedingly interesting that some discoveries in
our experiments are consistent with some findings of psychological research.]]></summary>

Although concepts like anger or awe are abstract, there is a shared consensus
about what these English emotion words mean. This consensus may give the
impression that their meaning is static, but we propose this is not the case.
We cannot travel back to earlier periods to study emotion concepts directly,
but we can examine text corpora, which have partially preserved the meaning of
emotion words. Using natural language processing of historical text, we found
evidence for semantic change in emotion words over the past century and that
varying rates of change were predicted in part by an emotion concept's
prototypicality - how representative it is of the broader category of
"emotion". Prototypicality negatively correlated with historical rates of
emotion semantic change obtained from text-based word embeddings, beyond more
established variables including usage frequency in English and a second
comparison language, French. This effect for prototypicality did not
consistently extend to the semantic category of birds, suggesting its relevance
for predicting semantic change may be category-dependent. Our results suggest
emotion semantics are evolving over time, with prototypical emotion words
remaining semantically stable, while other emotion words evolve more freely.]]></summary>

SQL. Furthermore, query languages can answer questions that require complex
reasoning, as well as offering full explainability. In this paper, we propose a
hybrid framework that takes both textual and tabular evidence as input and
generates either direct answers or SQL queries depending on which form could
better answer the question. The generated SQL queries can then be executed on
the associated databases to obtain the final answers. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first paper that applies Text2SQL to ODQA tasks.
Empirically, we demonstrate that on several ODQA datasets, the hybrid methods
consistently outperforms the baseline models that only take homogeneous input
by a large margin. Specifically we achieve state-of-the-art performance on

societies, yet a crucial step in the process, Optical Character Recognition
(OCR), is still not perfect. Even commercial OCR systems can produce
questionable output depending on the fidelity of the scanned documents. In this
paper, we demonstrate an effective framework for mitigating OCR errors for any
downstream NLP task, using Named Entity Recognition (NER) as an example. We
first address the data scarcity problem for model training by constructing a
document synthesis pipeline, generating realistic but degraded data with NER
labels. We measure the NER accuracy drop at various degradation levels and show
that a text restoration model, trained on the degraded data, significantly
closes the NER accuracy gaps caused by OCR errors, including on an
out-of-domain dataset. For the benefit of the community, we have made the
document synthesis pipeline available as an open-source project.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Structured text understanding on Visually Rich Documents (VRDs) is a crucial
part of Document Intelligence. Due to the complexity of content and layout in
VRDs, structured text understanding has been a challenging task. Most existing
studies decoupled this problem into two sub-tasks: entity labeling and entity
linking, which require an entire understanding of the context of documents at
both token and segment levels. However, little work has been concerned with the
solutions that efficiently extract the structured data from different levels.
This paper proposes a unified framework named StrucTexT, which is flexible and
effective for handling both sub-tasks. Specifically, based on the transformer,
we introduce a segment-token aligned encoder to deal with the entity labeling
and entity linking tasks at different levels of granularity. Moreover, we
design a novel pre-training strategy with three self-supervised tasks to learn
a richer representation. StrucTexT uses the existing Masked Visual Language
Modeling task and the new Sentence Length Prediction and Paired Boxes Direction
tasks to incorporate the multi-modal information across text, image, and
layout. We evaluate our method for structured text understanding at
segment-level and token-level and show it outperforms the state-of-the-art
counterparts with significantly superior performance on the FUNSD, SROIE, and
EPHOIE datasets.]]></summary>

become easily spread through social media. The most cost and time effective way
to filter these large amounts of data is to use a combination of human and

Language Processing (NLP) is widely used in detecting fake news. Social media
companies use NLP techniques to identify the fake news and warn their users,
but fake news may still slip through undetected. It is especially a problem in
more localised contexts (outside the United States of America). How do we
adjust fake news detection systems to work better for local contexts such as in
South Africa. In this work we investigate fake news detection on South African
websites. We curate a dataset of South African fake news and then train
detection models. We contrast this with using widely available fake news
datasets (from mostly USA website). We also explore making the datasets more
diverse by combining them and observe the differences in behaviour in writing
between nations' fake news using interpretable machine learning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recall the classical text generation works, the generation framework can be
briefly divided into two phases: \textbf{idea reasoning} and \textbf{surface
realization}. The target of idea reasoning is to figure out the main idea which
will be presented in the following talking/writing periods. Surface realization
aims to arrange the most appropriate sentence to depict and convey the
information distilled from the main idea. However, the current popular
token-by-token text generation methods ignore this crucial process and suffer
from many serious issues, such as idea/topic drift. To tackle the problems and
realize this two-phase paradigm, we propose a new framework named Sentence
Semantic Regression (\textbf{SSR}) based on sentence-level language modeling.
For idea reasoning, two architectures \textbf{SSR-AR} and \textbf{SSR-NonAR}
are designed to conduct sentence semantic regression autoregressively (like
GPT2/3) and bidirectionally (like BERT). In the phase of surface realization, a
mixed-granularity sentence decoder is designed to generate text with better
consistency by jointly incorporating the predicted sentence-level main idea as
well as the preceding contextual token-level information. We conduct
experiments on four tasks of story ending prediction, story ending generation,
dialogue generation, and sentence infilling. The results show that SSR can
obtain better performance in terms of automatic metrics and human evaluation.]]></summary>

legislated as a crime that must be identified and blocked. However, due to the
sheer volume and velocity of the Twitter data stream, hate speech detection
cannot be performed manually. To address this issue, several studies have been
conducted for hate speech detection in European languages, whereas little
attention has been paid to low-resource South Asian languages, making the
social media vulnerable for millions of users. In particular, to the best of
our knowledge, no study has been conducted for hate speech detection in Roman
Urdu text, which is widely used in the sub-continent. In this study, we have
scrapped more than 90,000 tweets and manually parsed them to identify 5,000
Roman Urdu tweets. Subsequently, we have employed an iterative approach to
develop guidelines and used them for generating the Hate Speech Roman Urdu 2020
corpus. The tweets in the this corpus are classified at three levels:
Neutral-Hostile, Simple-Complex, and Offensive-Hate speech. As another
contribution, we have used five supervised learning techniques, including a
deep learning technique, to evaluate and compare their effectiveness for hate
speech detection. The results show that Logistic Regression outperformed all
other techniques, including deep learning techniques for the two levels of
classification, by achieved an F1 score of 0.906 for distinguishing between
Neutral-Hostile tweets, and 0.756 for distinguishing between Offensive-Hate
speech tweets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper investigates a valuable setting called few-shot unsupervised
domain adaptation (FS-UDA), which has not been sufficiently studied in the
literature. In this setting, the source domain data are labelled, but with
few-shot per category, while the target domain data are unlabelled. To address
the FS-UDA setting, we develop a general UDA model to solve the following two
key issues: the few-shot labeled data per category and the domain adaptation
between support and query sets. Our model is general in that once trained it
will be able to be applied to various FS-UDA tasks from the same source and
target domains. Inspired by the recent local descriptor based few-shot learning
(FSL), our general UDA model is fully built upon local descriptors (LDs) for
image classification and domain adaptation. By proposing a novel concept called
similarity patterns (SPs), our model not only effectively considers the spatial
relationship of LDs that was ignored in previous FSL methods, but also makes
the learned image similarity better serve the required domain alignment.
Specifically, we propose a novel IMage-to-class sparse Similarity Encoding
(IMSE) method. It learns SPs to extract the local discriminative information
for classification and meanwhile aligns the covariance matrix of the SPs for
domain adaptation. Also, domain adversarial training and multi-scale local
feature matching are performed upon LDs. Extensive experiments conducted on a
multi-domain benchmark dataset DomainNet demonstrates the state-of-the-art
performance of our IMSE for the novel setting of FS-UDA. In addition, for FSL,
our IMSE can also show better performance than most of recent FSL methods on
miniImageNet.]]></summary>

on point cloud segmentation with the power of deep networks, current deep
learning methods based on the clean label assumptions may fail with noisy
labels. Yet, object class labels are often mislabeled in real-world point cloud
datasets. In this work, we take the lead in solving this issue by proposing a
novel Point Noise-Adaptive Learning (PNAL) framework. Compared to existing
noise-robust methods on image tasks, our PNAL is noise-rate blind, to cope with
the spatially variant noise rate problem specific to point clouds.
Specifically, we propose a novel point-wise confidence selection to obtain
reliable labels based on the historical predictions of each point. A novel
cluster-wise label correction is proposed with a voting strategy to generate
the best possible label taking the neighbor point correlations into
consideration. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of PNAL on both synthetic and real-world noisy datasets. In
particular, even with $60\%$ symmetric noisy labels, our proposed method
produces much better results than its baseline counterpart without PNAL and is
comparable to the ideal upper bound trained on a completely clean dataset.
Moreover, we fully re-labeled the validation set of a popular but noisy
real-world scene dataset ScanNetV2 to make it clean, for rigorous experiment
and future research. Our code and data are available at

its own activation pattern, domain, and empirical error. Empirical error for
the full network can be written as an expectation over empirical error of

error indicates that the more densely a subfunction is surrounded by training
samples in representation space, the more reliable its predictions are.
Further, it suggests that models with fewer activation regions generalize
better, and models that abstract knowledge to a greater degree generalize
better, all else equal. We propose not only a theoretical framework to reason
about subfunction error bounds but also a pragmatic way of approximately
evaluating it, which we apply to predicting which samples the network will not
successfully generalize to. We test our method on detection of
misclassification and out-of-distribution samples, finding that it performs
competitively in both cases. In short, some network activation patterns are
associated with higher reliability than others, and these can be identified

embed logical queries and KG entities in the vector space and conduct query
answering via dense similarity search. However, most of the designed logical
operators in existing works do not satisfy the axiomatic system of classical
logic. Moreover, these logical operators are parameterized so that they require
a large number of complex FOL queries as training data, which are often arduous
or even inaccessible to collect in most real-world KGs. In this paper, we
present FuzzQE, a fuzzy logic based query embedding framework for answering FOL
queries over KGs. FuzzQE follows fuzzy logic to define logical operators in a
principled and learning free manner. Extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FuzzQE achieves significantly better performance in
answering FOL queries compared to the state-of-the-art methods. In addition,
FuzzQE trained with only KG link prediction without any complex queries can
achieve comparable performance with the systems trained with all FOL queries.]]></summary>

high-resolution 3D images over time for living model organisms. To be able to
image even large specimens, techniques like multi-view light-sheet imaging
record different orientations at each time point that can then be fused into a
single high-quality volume. Based on measured point spread functions (PSF),
deconvolution and content fusion are able to largely revert the inevitable
degradation occurring during the imaging process. Classical multi-view
deconvolution and fusion methods mainly use iterative procedures and
content-based averaging. Lately, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been
deployed to approach 3D single-view deconvolution microscopy, but the
multi-view case waits to be studied. We investigated the efficacy of CNN-based
multi-view deconvolution and fusion with two synthetic data sets that mimic
developing embryos and involve either two or four complementary 3D views.
Compared with classical state-of-the-art methods, the proposed semi- and
self-supervised models achieve competitive and superior deconvolution and
fusion quality in the two-view and quad-view cases, respectively.]]></summary>

However, most of the works have focused on (semi-) supervised learning,
resulting in shortcomings including heavy label reliance, poor generalization,
and weak robustness. To address these issues, self-supervised learning (SSL),
which extracts informative knowledge through well-designed pretext tasks
without relying on manual labels, has become a promising and trending learning
paradigm for graph data. Different from SSL on other domains like computer
vision and natural language processing, SSL on graphs has an exclusive
background, design ideas, and taxonomies. Under the umbrella of graph
self-supervised learning, we present a timely and comprehensive review of the
existing approaches which employ SSL techniques for graph data. We construct a
unified framework that mathematically formalizes the paradigm of graph SSL.
According to the objectives of pretext tasks, we divide these approaches into
four categories: generation-based, auxiliary property-based, contrast-based,
and hybrid approaches. We further conclude the applications of graph SSL across
various research fields and summarize the commonly used datasets, evaluation
benchmark, performance comparison and open-source codes of graph SSL. Finally,
we discuss the remaining challenges and potential future directions in this
research field.]]></summary>

Traditionally, creating a GAN model has required the collection of a
large-scale dataset of exemplars and specialized knowledge in deep learning. In
contrast, sketching is possibly the most universally accessible way to convey a
visual concept. In this work, we present a method, GAN Sketching, for rewriting
GANs with one or more sketches, to make GANs training easier for novice users.
In particular, we change the weights of an original GAN model according to user
sketches. We encourage the model's output to match the user sketches through a
cross-domain adversarial loss. Furthermore, we explore different regularization
methods to preserve the original model's diversity and image quality.
Experiments have shown that our method can mold GANs to match shapes and poses
specified by sketches while maintaining realism and diversity. Finally, we
demonstrate a few applications of the resulting GAN, including latent space
interpolation and image editing.]]></summary>

SNDlib. Results show that our approach achieves more than 65\% feature size
reduction, more than 70% accuracy in parameter prediction of an energy

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI and reinforcement learning (RL) have improved many areas, but are not yet
widely adopted in economic policy design, mechanism design, or economics at
large. At the same time, current economic methodology is limited by a lack of
counterfactual data, simplistic behavioral models, and limited opportunities to
experiment with policies and evaluate behavioral responses. Here we show that
machine-learning-based economic simulation is a powerful policy and mechanism
design framework to overcome these limitations. The AI Economist is a
two-level, deep RL framework that trains both agents and a social planner who
co-adapt, providing a tractable solution to the highly unstable and novel
two-level RL challenge. From a simple specification of an economy, we learn
rational agent behaviors that adapt to learned planner policies and vice versa.
We demonstrate the efficacy of the AI Economist on the problem of optimal
taxation. In simple one-step economies, the AI Economist recovers the optimal
tax policy of economic theory. In complex, dynamic economies, the AI Economist
substantially improves both utilitarian social welfare and the trade-off
between equality and productivity over baselines. It does so despite emergent
tax-gaming strategies, while accounting for agent interactions and behavioral
change more accurately than economic theory. These results demonstrate for the
first time that two-level, deep RL can be used for understanding and as a
complement to theory for economic design, unlocking a new computational
learning-based approach to understanding economic policy.]]></summary>

imitation learning (GAIL) algorithms to observation noise. Towards this
objective, we study the effect of local Lipschitzness of the discriminator and
the generator on the robustness of policies learned by GAIL. In many robotics
applications, the learned policies by GAIL typically suffer from a degraded
performance at test time since the observations from the environment might be
corrupted by noise. Hence, robustifying the learned policies against the
observation noise is of critical importance. To this end, we propose a
regularization method to induce local Lipschitzness in the generator and the
discriminator of adversarial imitation learning methods. We show that the
modified objective leads to learning significantly more robust policies.
Moreover, we demonstrate --- both theoretically and experimentally --- that
training a locally Lipschitz discriminator leads to a locally Lipschitz
generator, thereby improving the robustness of the resultant policy. We perform
extensive experiments on simulated robot locomotion environments from the
MuJoCo suite that demonstrate the proposed method learns policies that

Furthermore, few studies have employed AI interpretability tools to investigate

fraud detection module. Considering these two points together, we propose a
novel anomaly detection framework for credit card fraud detection as well as a
model-explaining module responsible for prediction explanations. The fraud
detection model is composed of two deep neural networks, which are trained in
an unsupervised and adversarial manner. Precisely, the generator is an
AutoEncoder aiming to reconstruct genuine transaction data, while the
discriminator is a fully-connected network for fraud detection. The explanation
module has three white-box explainers in charge of interpretations of the
AutoEncoder, discriminator, and the whole detection model, respectively.
Experimental results show the state-of-the-art performances of our fraud
detection model on the benchmark dataset compared with baselines. In addition,
prediction analyses by three explainers are presented, offering a clear

representations, while humans communicate mostly through discrete symbols.
Reconciling these two forms of communication is desirable for generating
human-readable interpretations or learning discrete latent variable models,
while maintaining end-to-end differentiability. Some existing approaches (such
as the Gumbel-Softmax transformation) build continuous relaxations that are
discrete approximations in the zero-temperature limit, while others (such as
sparsemax transformations and the Hard Concrete distribution) produce
discrete/continuous hybrids. In this paper, we build rigorous theoretical
foundations for these hybrids, which we call "mixed random variables." Our
starting point is a new "direct sum" base measure defined on the face lattice
of the probability simplex. From this measure, we introduce new entropy and
Kullback-Leibler divergence functions that subsume the discrete and
differential cases and have interpretations in terms of code optimality. Our
framework suggests two strategies for representing and sampling mixed random
variables, an extrinsic ("sample-and-project") and an intrinsic one (based on
face stratification). We experiment with both approaches on an emergent
communication benchmark and on modeling MNIST and Fashion-MNIST data with
variational auto-encoders with mixed latent variables.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few-Shot Learning (FSL) algorithms have made substantial progress in learning
novel concepts with just a handful of labelled data. To classify query
instances from novel classes encountered at test-time, they only require a
support set composed of a few labelled samples. FSL benchmarks commonly assume
that those queries come from the same distribution as instances in the support
set. However, in a realistic set-ting, data distribution is plausibly subject
to change, a situation referred to as Distribution Shift (DS). The present work
addresses the new and challenging problem of Few-Shot Learning under
Support/Query Shift (FSQS) i.e., when support and query instances are sampled
from related but different distributions. Our contributions are the following.
First, we release a testbed for FSQS, including datasets, relevant baselines
and a protocol for a rigorous and reproducible evaluation. Second, we observe
that well-established FSL algorithms unsurprisingly suffer from a considerable
drop in accuracy when facing FSQS, stressing the significance of our study.
Finally, we show that transductive algorithms can limit the inopportune effect
of DS. In particular, we study both the role of Batch-Normalization and Optimal
Transport (OT) in aligning distributions, bridging Unsupervised Domain
Adaptation with FSL. This results in a new method that efficiently combines OT
with the celebrated Prototypical Networks. We bring compelling experiments
demonstrating the advantage of our method. Our work opens an exciting line of
research by providing a testbed and strong baselines. Our code is available at

multiple subnetworks that independently learn the task at hand. By ensembling
the predictions made by the subnetworks, we improve model robustness without

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, much progress has been made in unsupervised restoration learning.
However, existing methods more or less rely on some assumptions on the signal
and/or degradation model, which limits their practical performance. How to
construct an optimal criterion for unsupervised restoration learning without
any prior knowledge on the degradation model is still an open question. Toward
answering this question, this work proposes a criterion for unsupervised
restoration learning based on the optimal transport theory. This criterion has
favorable properties, e.g., approximately maximal preservation of the
information of the signal, whilst achieving perceptual reconstruction.
Furthermore, though a relaxed unconstrained formulation is used in practical
implementation, we show that the relaxed formulation in theory has the same
solution as the original constrained formulation. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world data, including realistic photographic, microscopy, depth, and raw
depth images, demonstrate that the proposed method even compares favorably with
supervised methods, e.g., approaching the PSNR of supervised methods while
having better perceptual quality. Particularly, for spatially correlated noise
and realistic microscopy images, the proposed method not only achieves better
perceptual quality but also has higher PSNR than supervised methods. Besides,
it shows remarkable superiority in harsh practical conditions with complex
noise, e.g., raw depth images.]]></summary>

detection task. Thus, it is necessary to focus on more challenging task of
few-shot object detection. It requires the detector to recognize objects of
novel classes with only a few training samples. Nowadays, many existing popular
methods based on meta-learning have achieved promising performance, such as
Meta R-CNN series. However, only a single category of support data is used as
the attention to guide the detecting of query images each time. Their relevance
to each other remains unexploited. Moreover, a lot of recent works treat the
support data and query images as independent branch without considering the
relationship between them. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic
relevance learning model, which utilizes the relationship between all support
images and Region of Interest (RoI) on the query images to construct a dynamic
graph convolutional network (GCN). By adjusting the prediction distribution of
the base detector using the output of this GCN, the proposed model can guide
the detector to improve the class representation implicitly. Comprehensive
experiments have been conducted on Pascal VOC and MS-COCO dataset. The proposed
model achieves the best overall performance, which shows its effectiveness of
learning more generalized features. Our code is available at

tremendous strides, but it still heavily relies on fixed datasets in stationary
environments. Continual learning is a growing field of research that examines
how AI systems can learn sequentially from a continuous stream of linked data
in the same way that biological systems do. Simultaneously, fake media such as
deepfakes and synthetic face images have emerged as significant to current
multimedia technologies. Recently, numerous method has been proposed which can
detect deepfakes with high accuracy. However, they suffer significantly due to
their reliance on fixed datasets in limited evaluation settings. Therefore, in
this work, we apply continuous learning to neural networks' learning dynamics,
emphasizing its potential to increase data efficiency significantly. We propose
Continual Representation using Distillation (CoReD) method that employs the
concept of Continual Learning (CL), Representation Learning (RL), and Knowledge
Distillation (KD). We design CoReD to perform sequential domain adaptation
tasks on new deepfake and GAN-generated synthetic face datasets, while
effectively minimizing the catastrophic forgetting in a teacher-student model
setting. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method is

propose a CNN layer that performs regularization by applying random rotations
of reflections to a small percentage of feature maps after every convolutional
layer. We prove how this concept is beneficial for images with orientational
symmetries, such as in medical images, as it provides a certain degree of
rotational invariance. We tested this method in two datasets, a patch-based set

However, existing methods lack the ability to preserve the identity of the
source domain. As a result, synthesized images can often over-adapt to the
reference domain, losing important structural characteristics and suffering
from suboptimal visual quality. To solve these challenges, we propose a novel
frequency domain image translation (FDIT) framework, exploiting frequency
information for enhancing the image generation process. Our key idea is to
decompose the image into low-frequency and high-frequency components, where the
high-frequency feature captures object structure akin to the identity. Our
training objective facilitates the preservation of frequency information in
both pixel space and Fourier spectral space. We broadly evaluate FDIT across
five large-scale datasets and multiple tasks including image translation and
GAN inversion. Extensive experiments and ablations show that FDIT effectively
preserves the identity of the source image, and produces photo-realistic
images. FDIT establishes state-of-the-art performance, reducing the average FID

resources to adhere to cost and power limitations of their carrying system.
Deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained hardware became possible
with model compression techniques, as well as efficient and hardware-aware
architecture design. However, model adaptation is additionally required due to
the diverse operation environments. In this work, we address the problem of
training deep neural networks on resource-constrained hardware in the context
of visual domain adaptation. We select the task of monocular depth estimation
where our goal is to transform a pre-trained model to the target's domain data.
While the source domain includes labels, we assume an unlabelled target domain,
as it happens in real-world applications. Then, we present an adversarial
learning approach that is adapted for training on the device with limited
resources. Since visual domain adaptation, i.e. neural network training, has
not been previously explored for resource-constrained hardware, we present the
first feasibility study for image-based depth estimation. Our experiments show
that visual domain adaptation is relevant only for efficient network
architectures and training sets at the order of a few hundred samples. Models

Specifically, these connections improve emotion classification by sharing
intermediate representations among EDA and ECG and apply attention weights to

amending the performance of autonomous road vehicles, through a drone traffic
monitor (DTM), that also acts as an orchestrator. Expecting non-IID data
distribution, we focus on the issue of accelerating the learning of a
particular class of critical object (CO), that may harm the nominal operation
of an autonomous vehicle. This can be done through proper allocation of the
wireless resources for addressing learner and data heterogeneity. Thus, we
propose a reactive method for the allocation of wireless resources, that
happens dynamically each FL round, and is based on each learner's contribution
to the general model. In addition to this, we explore the use of static methods
that remain constant across all rounds. Since we expect partial work from each
learner, we use the FedProx FL algorithm, in the task of computer vision. For
testing, we construct a non-IID data distribution of the MNIST and FMNIST
datasets among four types of learners, in scenarios that represent the quickly
changing environment. The results show that proactive measures are effective
and versatile at improving system accuracy, and quickly learning the CO class
when underrepresented in the network. Furthermore, the experiments show a
tradeoff between FedProx intensity and resource allocation efforts.
Nonetheless, a well adjusted FedProx local optimizer allows for an even better
overall accuracy, particularly when using deeper neural network (NN)
implementations.]]></summary>

achieving low regret, and identifying $\epsilon$-optimal policies. While a
simple reduction allows one to apply a low-regret algorithm to obtain an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy and achieve the worst-case optimal rate, it is
unknown whether low-regret algorithms can obtain the instance-optimal rate for
policy identification. We show that this is not possible -- there exists a
fundamental tradeoff between achieving low regret and identifying an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy at the instance-optimal rate.

Motivated by our negative finding, we propose a new measure of
instance-dependent sample complexity for PAC tabular reinforcement learning
which explicitly accounts for the attainable state visitation distributions in
the underlying MDP. We then propose and analyze a novel, planning-based
algorithm which attains this sample complexity -- yielding a complexity which
scales with the suboptimality gaps and the ``reachability'' of a state. We show
that our algorithm is nearly minimax optimal, and on several examples that our
instance-dependent sample complexity offers significant improvements over
worst-case bounds.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linear layouts are a graph visualization method that can be used to capture
an entry pattern in an adjacency matrix of a given graph. By reordering the
node indices of the original adjacency matrix, linear layouts provide knowledge
of latent graph structures. Conventional linear layout methods commonly aim to
find an optimal reordering solution based on predefined features of a given
matrix and loss function. However, prior knowledge of the appropriate features
to use or structural patterns in a given adjacency matrix is not always
available. In such a case, performing the reordering based on data-driven
feature extraction without assuming a specific structure in an adjacency matrix
is preferable. Recently, a neural-network-based matrix reordering method called
DeepTMR has been proposed to perform this function. However, it is limited to a
two-mode reordering (i.e., the rows and columns are reordered separately) and
it cannot be applied in the one-mode setting (i.e., the same node order is used
for reordering both rows and columns), owing to the characteristics of its
model architecture. In this study, we extend DeepTMR and propose a new one-mode
linear layout method referred to as AutoLL. We developed two types of neural
network models, AutoLL-D and AutoLL-U, for reordering directed and undirected
networks, respectively. To perform one-mode reordering, these AutoLL models
have specific encoder architectures, which extract node features from an
observed adjacency matrix. We conducted both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations of the proposed approach, and the experimental results demonstrate
its effectiveness.]]></summary>

find a set of policies that play optimally together. Policies learned through
self-play may adopt arbitrary conventions and implicitly rely on multi-step
reasoning based on fragile assumptions about other agents' actions and thus
fail when paired with humans or independently trained agents at test time. To
address this, we present off-belief learning (OBL). At each timestep OBL agents
follow a policy $\pi_1$ that is optimized assuming past actions were taken by a
given, fixed policy ($\pi_0$), but assuming that future actions will be taken
by $\pi_1$. When $\pi_0$ is uniform random, OBL converges to an optimal policy
that does not rely on inferences based on other agents' behavior (an optimal
grounded policy). OBL can be iterated in a hierarchy, where the optimal policy
from one level becomes the input to the next, thereby introducing multi-level
cognitive reasoning in a controlled manner. Unlike existing approaches, which
may converge to any equilibrium policy, OBL converges to a unique policy,
making it suitable for zero-shot coordination (ZSC). OBL can be scaled to

partition spaces recursively with axis-aligned cuts, and is widely applied in

unlabeled images. The state-of-the-art methods are consistency-based which
learn about unlabeled images by encouraging the model to give consistent
predictions for images under different augmentations. However, when applied to
pose estimation, the methods degenerate and predict every pixel in unlabeled
images as background. This is because contradictory predictions are gradually
pushed to the background class due to highly imbalanced class distribution. But
this is not an issue in supervised learning because it has accurate labels.
This inspires us to stabilize the training by obtaining reliable pseudo labels.
Specifically, we learn two networks to mutually teach each other. In
particular, for each image, we compose an easy-hard pair by applying different
augmentations and feed them to both networks. The more reliable predictions on
easy images in each network are used to teach the other network to learn about
the corresponding hard images. The approach successfully avoids degeneration

challenging to build an efficient end-to-end multimedia application with most

non-experts to implement deep learning models, obtain the right settings for

chain has received a lot of attention from the materials community, fewer
efforts have taken into consideration uncertainties. Those arise from a
multitude of sources and their quantification and integration in the inversion
process are essential in meeting the materials design objectives. The first
contribution of this paper is a flexible, fully probabilistic formulation of
such optimization problems that accounts for the uncertainty in the
process-structure and structure-property linkages and enables the
identification of optimal, high-dimensional, process parameters. We employ a
probabilistic, data-driven surrogate for the structure-property link which
expedites computations and enables handling of non-differential objectives. We
couple this with a novel active learning strategy, i.e. a self-supervised
collection of data, which significantly improves accuracy while requiring small
amounts of training data. We demonstrate its efficacy in optimizing the
mechanical and thermal properties of two-phase, random media but envision its
applicability encompasses a wide variety of microstructure-sensitive design

In this work, we introduce HyperJump, a new approach that builds on HyperBand's

techniques that accelerate the search by jumping the evaluation of low risk

accuracy. This also holds for probabilistic forecasting methods where
predictive distributions are combined. There are several time-varying and
adaptive weighting schemes such as Bayesian model averaging (BMA). However, the
quality of different forecasts may vary not only over time but also within the
distribution. For example, some distribution forecasts may be more accurate in
the center of the distributions, while others are better at predicting the
tails. Therefore, we introduce a new weighting method that considers the
differences in performance over time and within the distribution. We discuss
pointwise combination algorithms based on aggregation across quantiles that
optimize with respect to the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). After
analyzing the theoretical properties of pointwise CRPS learning, we discuss B-
and P-Spline-based estimation techniques for batch and online learning, based
on quantile regression and prediction with expert advice. We prove that the
proposed fully adaptive Bernstein online aggregation (BOA) method for pointwise
CRPS online learning has optimal convergence properties. They are confirmed in

to the hardness of the specific function we wish to optimize. While previous
work provide worst-case bounds for arbitrary convex functions, it is often the

the optimum, i.e., $f(x) \ge f(x^*) + \lambda \kappa^{-1} \|x-x^*\|_2^\kappa$
for $\kappa > 1$, our algorithms improve upon the standard

$({\sqrt{d}}/{n\varepsilon})^{\tfrac{\kappa}{\kappa - 1}}$. Crucially, they
achieve these rates without knowledge of the growth constant $\kappa$ of the
function. Our algorithms build upon the inverse sensitivity mechanism, which
adapts to instance difficulty (Asi & Duchi, 2020), and recent localization
techniques in private optimization (Feldman et al., 2020). We complement our
algorithms with matching lower bounds for these function classes and

off. Among these approaches, contrastive learning has seen tremendous progress
and led to state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we construct a novel
probabilistic graphical model that effectively incorporates the low rank
promoting prior into the framework of contrastive learning, referred to as
LORAC. In contrast to the existing conventional self-supervised approaches that
only considers independent learning, our hypothesis explicitly requires that
all the samples belonging to the same instance class lie on the same subspace
with small dimension. This heuristic poses particular joint learning
constraints to reduce the degree of freedom of the problem during the search of
the optimal network parameterization. Most importantly, we argue that the low
rank prior employed here is not unique, and many different priors can be
invoked in a similar probabilistic way, corresponding to different hypotheses
about underlying truth behind the contrastive features. Empirical evidences
show that the proposed algorithm clearly surpasses the state-of-the-art

past knowledge while being trained on new tasks. Common techniques to handle CF
include regularization of the weights (using, e.g., their importance on past
tasks), and rehearsal strategies, where the network is constantly re-trained on
past data. Generative models have also been applied for the latter, in order to
have endless sources of data. In this paper, we propose a novel method that
combines the strengths of regularization and generative-based rehearsal
approaches. Our generative model consists of a normalizing flow (NF), a
probabilistic and invertible neural network, trained on the internal embeddings
of the network. By keeping a single NF conditioned on the task, we show that
our memory overhead remains constant. In addition, exploiting the invertibility
of the NF, we propose a simple approach to regularize the network's embeddings
with respect to past tasks. We show that our method performs favorably with

we introduce dependent MMD coresets, a data summarization method for

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have set latest
state-of-the-art on various human activity recognition (HAR) datasets. However,
deep CNNs often require more computing resources, which limits their
applications in embedded HAR. Although many successful methods have been
proposed to reduce memory and FLOPs of CNNs, they often involve special network
architectures designed for visual tasks, which are not suitable for deep HAR
tasks with time series sensor signals, due to remarkable discrepancy.
Therefore, it is necessary to develop lightweight deep models to perform HAR.
As filter is the basic unit in constructing CNNs, it deserves further research
whether re-designing smaller filters is applicable for deep HAR. In the paper,
inspired by the idea, we proposed a lightweight CNN using Lego filters for HAR.
A set of lower-dimensional filters is used as Lego bricks to be stacked for
conventional filters, which does not rely on any special network structure. The
local loss function is used to train model. To our knowledge, this is the first
paper that proposes lightweight CNN for HAR in ubiquitous and wearable
computing arena. The experiment results on five public HAR datasets, UCI-HAR
dataset, OPPORTUNITY dataset, UNIMIB-SHAR dataset, PAMAP2 dataset, and WISDM
dataset collected from either smartphones or multiple sensor nodes, indicate
that our novel Lego CNN with local loss can greatly reduce memory and
computation cost over CNN, while achieving higher accuracy. That is to say, the
proposed model is smaller, faster and more accurate. Finally, we evaluate the
actual performance on an Android smartphone.]]></summary>

suffer from high variance of gradient estimate. To reduce the variance, the
state value function is applied commonly. However, the effect of the state
value function becomes limited in stochastic dynamic environments, where the
unexpected state dynamics and rewards will increase the variance. In this
paper, we propose to replace the state value function with a novel hindsight
value function, which leverages the information from the future to reduce the
variance of the gradient estimate for stochastic dynamic environments.

Particularly, to obtain an ideally unbiased gradient estimate, we propose an
information-theoretic approach, which optimizes the embeddings of the future to
be independent of previous actions. In our experiments, we apply the proposed
hindsight value function in stochastic dynamic environments, including
discrete-action environments and continuous-action environments. Compared with
the standard state value function, the proposed hindsight value function
consistently reduces the variance, stabilizes the training, and improves the
eventual policy.]]></summary>

to assist physicians with diagnosis and treatment. However, it is difficult to
obtain massive amounts of annotated training data required by the deep-learning
models as the manual delineation process is often tedious and expertise
required. Although self-supervised learning (SSL) scheme has been widely
adopted to address this problem, most SSL methods focus only on global
structure information, ignoring the key distinguishing features of tumor
regions: local intensity variation and large size distribution. In this paper,
we propose Scale-Aware Restoration (SAR), a SSL method for 3D tumor
segmentation. Specifically, a novel proxy task, i.e. scale discrimination, is
formulated to pre-train the 3D neural network combined with the
self-restoration task. Thus, the pre-trained model learns multi-level local
representations through multi-scale inputs. Moreover, an adversarial learning
module is further introduced to learn modality invariant representations from
multiple unlabeled source datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
methods on two downstream tasks: i) Brain tumor segmentation, ii) Pancreas
tumor segmentation. Compared with the state-of-the-art 3D SSL methods, our
proposed approach can significantly improve the segmentation accuracy. Besides,
we analyze its advantages from multiple perspectives such as data efficiency,
performance, and convergence speed.]]></summary>

few cameras which are separated by wide baselines. It employs a multi-branch
network to jointly estimate 3D poses and re-identification (Re-ID) features for
all people in the environment. In contrast to previous efforts which require to
establish cross-view correspondence based on noisy 2D pose estimates, it
directly estimates and tracks 3D poses from a 3D voxel-based representation
constructed from multi-view images. We first discretize the 3D space by regular
voxels and compute a feature vector for each voxel by averaging the body joint
heatmaps that are inversely projected from all views. We estimate 3D poses from
the voxel representation by predicting whether each voxel contains a particular
body joint. Similarly, a Re-ID feature is computed for each voxel which is used
to track the estimated 3D poses over time. The main advantage of the approach
is that it avoids making any hard decisions based on individual images. The
approach can robustly estimate and track 3D poses even when people are severely
occluded in some cameras. It outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a

anti-spoofing (FAS) based on domain generalization (DG) has drawn growing
attention due to its robustness. Most existing methods utilize DG frameworks to
align the features to seek a compact and generalized feature space. However,
little attention has been paid to the feature extraction process for the FAS
task, especially the influence of normalization, which also has a great impact
on the generalization of the learned representation. To address this issue, we
propose a novel perspective of face anti-spoofing that focuses on the
normalization selection in the feature extraction process. Concretely, an
Adaptive Normalized Representation Learning (ANRL) framework is devised, which
adaptively selects feature normalization methods according to the inputs,
aiming to learn domain-agnostic and discriminative representation. Moreover, to
facilitate the representation learning, Dual Calibration Constraints are
designed, including Inter-Domain Compatible loss and Inter-Class Separable
loss, which provide a better optimization direction for generalizable
representation. Extensive experiments and visualizations are presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method against the SOTA competitors.]]></summary>

determine a special reconstruction loss for these augmented samples. This
reconstruction loss plus the original loss constitutes the final optimization
objective of the model. It is noteworthy that MA is very efficient and does not

demonstrate that MA can significantly improve the performance of many recently

models have received much attention from engineering fields. Since it was
proposed, Bayesian optimization has quickly become a popular and promising
approach for solving global optimization problems. However, the standard
Bayesian optimization algorithm is insufficient to solving the global optimal
solution when the model is high-dimensional. Hence, this paper presents a novel
high dimensional Bayesian optimization algorithm by considering dimension
reduction and different dimension fill-in strategies. Most existing literature
about Bayesian optimization algorithms did not discuss the sampling strategies
to optimize the acquisition function. This study proposed a new sampling method
based on both the multi-armed bandit and random search methods while optimizing
the acquisition function. Besides, based on the time-dependent or
dimension-dependent characteristics of the model, the proposed algorithm can
reduce the dimension evenly. Then, five different dimension fill-in strategies
were discussed and compared in this study. Finally, to increase the final
accuracy of the optimal solution, the proposed algorithm adds a local search
based on a series of Adam-based steps at the final stage. Our computational
experiments demonstrated that the proposed Bayesian optimization algorithm
could achieve reasonable solutions with excellent performances for high
dimensional global optimization problems with a time-series optimal control

propagation of underwater sound, so high-precision ocean front detection is of
great significance to the marine fishery and national defense fields. However,
the current ocean front detection methods either have low detection accuracy or

rarely considering the differences of the characteristics of multiple ocean
fronts in different sea areas. In order to solve the above problems, we propose
a semantic segmentation network called location and seasonality enhanced

network, we first design a channel supervision unit structure, which integrates
the seasonal characteristics of the ocean front itself and the contextual
information to improve the detection accuracy. We also introduce a location
attention mechanism to adaptively assign attention weights to the fronts
according to their frequently occurred sea area, which can further improve the

the experimental results demonstrate convincingly that our method is more

strong performance in several speech and vision problems. In contrast to other
generative models, normalizing flows are latent variable models with tractable
likelihoods and allow for stable training. However, they have to be carefully
designed to represent invertible functions with efficient Jacobian determinant
calculation. In practice, these requirements lead to overparameterized and
sophisticated architectures that are inferior to alternative feed-forward
models in terms of inference time and memory consumption. In this work, we
investigate whether one can distill flow-based models into more efficient

simple distillation approach and demonstrating its effectiveness on
state-of-the-art conditional flow-based models for image super-resolution and

learning approaches for lesion detection and classification on whole-slide
images (WSIs) with breast cancer. The deep features being distinguishing in
classification from the convolutional neural networks (CNN) are demonstrated in
this study to provide comprehensive interpretability for the proposed CAD
system using pathological knowledge. Methods: In the experiment, a total of 186
slides of WSIs were collected and classified into three categories:
Non-Carcinoma, Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS), and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma
(IDC). Instead of conducting pixel-wise classification into three classes
directly, we designed a hierarchical framework with the multi-view scheme that
performs lesion detection for region proposal at higher magnification first and
then conducts lesion classification at lower magnification for each detected
lesion. Results: The slide-level accuracy rate for three-category
classification reaches 90.8% (99/109) through 5-fold cross-validation and
achieves 94.8% (73/77) on the testing set. The experimental results show that
the morphological characteristics and co-occurrence properties learned by the
deep learning models for lesion classification are accordant with the clinical
rules in diagnosis. Conclusion: The pathological interpretability of the deep
features not only enhances the reliability of the proposed CAD system to gain
acceptance from medical specialists, but also facilitates the development of
deep learning frameworks for various tasks in pathology. Significance: This
paper presents a CAD system for pathological image analysis, which fills the
clinical requirements and can be accepted by medical specialists with providing
its interpretability from the pathological perspective.]]></summary>

structure, namely to cluster vertices into groups, or blocks, according to some
measure of similarity. Beyond mere adjacency matrices, many real networks also
involve vertex covariates that carry key information about underlying block
structure in graphs. To assess the effects of such covariates on block
recovery, we present a comparative analysis of two model-based spectral
algorithms for clustering vertices in stochastic blockmodel graphs with vertex
covariates. The first algorithm uses only the adjacency matrix, and directly
estimates the block assignments. The second algorithm incorporates both the
adjacency matrix and the vertex covariates into the estimation of block
assignments, and moreover quantifies the explicit impact of the vertex
covariates on the resulting estimate of the block assignments. We employ
Chernoff information to analytically compare the algorithms' performance and
derive the information-theoretic Chernoff ratio for certain models of interest.
Analytic results and simulations suggest that the second algorithm is often
preferred: we can often better estimate the induced block assignments by first
estimating the effect of vertex covariates. In addition, real data examples
also indicate that the second algorithm has the advantages of revealing
underlying block structure and taking observed vertex heterogeneity into
account in real applications. Our findings emphasize the importance of
distinguishing between observed and unobserved factors that can affect block
structure in graphs.]]></summary>

inspired by the celebrated fast multipole method (FMM) for accelerating
interacting particle simulation. FMM decomposes particle-particle interaction
into near-field and far-field components and then performs direct and
coarse-grained computation, respectively. Similarly, FMMformers decompose the
attention into near-field and far-field attention, modeling the near-field
attention by a banded matrix and the far-field attention by a low-rank matrix.
Computing the attention matrix for FMMformers requires linear complexity in
computational time and memory footprint with respect to the sequence length. In
contrast, standard transformers suffer from quadratic complexity. We analyze
and validate the advantage of FMMformers over the standard transformer on the
Long Range Arena and language modeling benchmarks. FMMformers can even
outperform the standard transformer in terms of accuracy by a significant
margin. For instance, FMMformers achieve an average classification accuracy of
$60.74\%$ over the five Long Range Arena tasks, which is significantly better

classifiers to maximize their misclassification rates is a central focus of
adversarial machine learning. An alternative approach is to synthesize
adversarial examples from scratch using GAN-like structures, albeit with the
use of large amounts of training data. By contrast, this paper considers
one-shot synthesis of adversarial examples; the inputs are synthesized from
scratch to induce arbitrary soft predictions at the output of pre-trained
models, while simultaneously maintaining high similarity to specified inputs.
To this end, we present a problem that encodes objectives on the distance
between the desired and output distributions of the trained model and the
similarity between such inputs and the synthesized examples. We prove that the
formulated problem is NP-complete. Then, we advance a generative approach to
the solution in which the adversarial examples are obtained as the output of a
generative network whose parameters are iteratively updated by optimizing
surrogate loss functions for the dual-objective. We demonstrate the generality
and versatility of the framework and approach proposed through applications to
the design of targeted adversarial attacks, generation of decision boundary
samples, and synthesis of low confidence classification inputs. The approach is
further extended to an ensemble of models with different soft output
specifications. The experimental results verify that the targeted and

2-dimensional signals (e.g., NLP and Image Content Understanding). As a
potential alternative to convolutional neural networks, it shares merits of
strong interpretability, high discriminative power on hyper-scale data, and
flexibility in processing varying length inputs. However, its encoders
naturally contain computational intensive operations such as pair-wise
self-attention, incurring heavy computational burden when being applied on the
complex 3-dimensional video signals.

This paper presents Token Shift Module (i.e., TokShift), a novel,
zero-parameter, zero-FLOPs operator, for modeling temporal relations within
each transformer encoder. Specifically, the TokShift barely temporally shifts
partial [Class] token features back-and-forth across adjacent frames. Then, we
densely plug the module into each encoder of a plain 2D vision transformer for
learning 3D video representation. It is worth noticing that our TokShift
transformer is a pure convolutional-free video transformer pilot with
computational efficiency for video understanding. Experiments on standard
benchmarks verify its robustness, effectiveness, and efficiency. Particularly,
with input clips of 8/12 frames, the TokShift transformer achieves SOTA
precision: 79.83%/80.40% on the Kinetics-400, 66.56% on EGTEA-Gaze+, and 96.80%

parameter-estimation technique for certain high-dimensional linear systems with
non-Gaussian distributions. However, AMP only applies to independent
identically distributed (IID) transform matrices, but may become unreliable
(e.g. perform poorly or even diverge) for other matrix ensembles, especially
for ill-conditioned ones. Orthogonal/vector AMP (OAMP/VAMP) was proposed for
general right-unitarily-invariant matrices to handle this difficulty. However,
the Bayes-optimal OAMP/VAMP requires a high-complexity linear minimum mean
square error (MMSE) estimator. This limits the application of OAMP/VAMP to
large-scale systems.

To solve the disadvantages of AMP and OAMP/VAMP, this paper proposes a memory
AMP (MAMP) framework under an orthogonality principle, which guarantees the
asymptotic IID Gaussianity of estimation errors in MAMP. We present an
orthogonalization procedure for the local memory estimators to realize the
required orthogonality for MAMP. Furthermore, we propose a Bayes-optimal MAMP
(BO-MAMP), in which a long-memory matched filter is proposed for interference
suppression. The complexity of BO-MAMP is comparable to AMP. A state evolution
is derived to asymptotically characterize the performance of BO-MAMP. Based on
state evolution, the relaxation parameters and damping vector in BO-MAMP are
optimized. For all right-unitarily-invariant matrices, the optimized BO-MAMP
converges to the high-complexity OAMP/VAMP, and thus is Bayes-optimal if it has
a unique fixed point. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the validity
and accuracy of the theoretical results.]]></summary>

discover via traditional rule-based defenses because it generally lacks
explicit indicators of compromise. We propose a behavior-based, unsupervised
framework comprising two methods of lateral movement detection on enterprise
networks: one aimed at generic lateral movement via either exploit or
authenticated connections, and one targeting the specific techniques of process
injection and hijacking. The first method is based on the premise that the role
of a system---the functions it performs on the network---determines the roles
of the systems it should make connections with. The adversary meanwhile might
move between any systems whatever, possibly seeking out systems with unusual
roles that facilitate certain accesses. We use unsupervised learning to cluster
systems according to role and identify connections to systems with novel roles
as potentially malicious. The second method is based on the premise that the
temporal patterns of inter-system processes that facilitate these connections
depend on the roles of the systems involved. If a process is compromised by an
attacker, these normal patterns might be disrupted in discernible ways. We
apply frequent-itemset mining to process sequences to establish regular
patterns of communication between systems based on role, and identify rare
process sequences as signalling potentially malicious connections.]]></summary>

ImageNet-21K available for everyone. Via a dedicated preprocessing stage,
utilization of WordNet hierarchical structure, and a novel training scheme
called semantic softmax, we show that various models significantly benefit from
ImageNet-21K pretraining on numerous datasets and tasks, including small
mobile-oriented models. We also show that we outperform previous ImageNet-21K
pretraining schemes for prominent new models like ViT and Mixer. Our proposed
pretraining pipeline is efficient, accessible, and leads to SoTA reproducible
results, from a publicly available dataset. The training code and pretrained

neural networks (GNNs) are designed to deal with graph-structural data that
classical deep learning does not easily manage. Since most GNNs were created
using distinct theories, direct comparisons are impossible. Prior research has
primarily concentrated on categorizing existing models, with little attention
paid to their intrinsic connections. The purpose of this study is to establish
a unified framework that integrates GNNs based on spectral graph and

with dropout layers. However, dropout is sometimes detrimental in the
convolutional part of a CNN as it simply sets to zero a percentage of pixels in
the feature maps, adding unrepresentative examples during training. Here, we
propose a CNN layer that performs regularization by applying random rotations
of reflections to a small percentage of feature maps after every convolutional
layer. We prove how this concept is beneficial for images with orientational
symmetries, such as in medical images, as it provides a certain degree of
rotational invariance. We tested this method in two datasets, a patch-based set
of histopathology images (PatchCamelyon) to perform classification using a
generic DenseNet, and a set of specular microscopy images of the corneal
endothelium to perform segmentation using a tailored U-net, improving the

assumes noiseless estimates. Moreover, we show how our algorithm can be adapted

high computing power and efficient hardware accelerator architecture. DNN
accelerators use a large number of processing elements (PEs) and on-chip memory

DNN accelerator, networks-on-chip (NoC) play an important role in supporting
various dataflow patterns and enabling processing with communication
parallelism in a DNN accelerator. However, the widely used mesh-based NoC
architectures inherently cannot support the efficient one-to-many and
many-to-one traffic largely existing in DNN workloads. In this paper, we
propose a modified mesh architecture with a one-way/two-way streaming bus to
speedup one-to-many (multicast) traffic, and the use of gather packets to
support many-to-one (gather) traffic. The analysis of the runtime latency of a
convolutional layer shows that the two-way streaming architecture achieves
better improvement than the one-way streaming architecture for an Output
Stationary (OS) dataflow architecture. The simulation results demonstrate that
the gather packets can help to reduce the runtime latency up to 1.8 times and
network power consumption up to 1.7 times, compared with the repetitive unicast

systems, web search, product design and elections. Limited by the lack of
general-purpose analytical tools, it is difficult to hand-engineer desirable
voting rules for each use case. For this reason, it is appealing to
automatically discover voting rules geared towards each scenario. In this
paper, we show that set-input neural network architectures such as Set
Transformers, fully-connected graph networks and DeepSets are both
theoretically and empirically well-suited for learning voting rules. In
particular, we show that these network models can not only mimic a number of
existing voting rules to compelling accuracy --- both position-based (such as
Plurality and Borda) and comparison-based (such as Kemeny, Copeland and
Maximin) --- but also discover near-optimal voting rules that maximize
different social welfare functions. Furthermore, the learned voting rules
generalize well to different voter utility distributions and election sizes
unseen during training.]]></summary>

description of neural networks in terms of a Wilsonian effective field theory.
The infinite-width limit is mapped to a free field theory, while finite $N$
corrections are taken into account by interactions (non-Gaussian terms in the
action). In this paper, we study two related aspects of this correspondence.
First, we comment on the concepts of locality and power-counting in this
context. Indeed, these usual space-time notions may not hold for neural
networks (since inputs can be arbitrary), however, the renormalization group
provides natural notions of locality and scaling. Moreover, we comment on
several subtleties, for example, that data components may not have a
permutation symmetry: in that case, we argue that random tensor field theories
could provide a natural generalization. Second, we improve the perturbative
Wilsonian renormalization from arXiv:2008.08601 by providing an analysis in
terms of the nonperturbative renormalization group using the Wetterich-Morris
equation. An important difference with usual nonperturbative RG analysis is
that only the effective (IR) 2-point function is known, which requires setting
the problem with care. Our aim is to provide a useful formalism to investigate
neural networks behavior beyond the large-width limit (i.e.~far from Gaussian
limit) in a nonperturbative fashion. A major result of our analysis is that
changing the standard deviation of the neural network weight distribution can
be interpreted as a renormalization flow in the space of networks. We focus on
translations invariant kernels and provide preliminary numerical results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is
designing efficient learning algorithms for a large system in which each agent
has only limited or partial information of the entire system. In this system,
it is desirable to learn policies of a decentralized type. A recent and
promising paradigm to analyze such decentralized MARL is to take network
structures into consideration. While exciting progress has been made to analyze
decentralized MARL with the network of agents, often found in social networks
and team video games, little is known theoretically for decentralized MARL with
the network of states, frequently used for modeling self-driving vehicles,
ride-sharing, and data and traffic routing.

This paper proposes a framework called localized training and decentralized
execution to study MARL with network of states, with homogeneous (a.k.a.
mean-field type) agents. Localized training means that agents only need to
collect local information in their neighboring states during the training
phase; decentralized execution implies that, after the training stage, agents
can execute the learned decentralized policies, which only requires knowledge
of the agents' current states. The key idea is to utilize the homogeneity of
agents and regroup them according to their states, thus the formulation of a
networked Markov decision process with teams of agents, enabling the update of
the Q-function in a localized fashion. In order to design an efficient and
scalable reinforcement learning algorithm under such a framework, we adopt the
actor-critic approach with over-parameterized neural networks, and establish
the convergence and sample complexity for our algorithm, shown to be scalable
with respect to the size of both agents and states.]]></summary>

compared to RGB images typically used in computer vision. These include a lack
of labels for large datasets, high computational costs, and metadata to
describe the physical properties of voxels. Data augmentation is used to
artificially increase the size of the training datasets. Training with image
patches decreases the need for computational power. Spatial metadata needs to
be carefully taken into account in order to ensure a correct alignment of
volumes.

We present TorchIO, an open-source Python library to enable efficient
loading, preprocessing, augmentation and patch-based sampling of medical images
for deep learning. TorchIO follows the style of PyTorch and integrates standard
medical image processing libraries to efficiently process images during
training of neural networks. TorchIO transforms can be composed, reproduced,
traced and extended. We provide multiple generic preprocessing and augmentation
operations as well as simulation of MRI-specific artifacts.

Source code, comprehensive tutorials and extensive documentation for TorchIO
can be found at https://torchio.rtfd.io/. The package can be installed from the
Python Package Index running 'pip install torchio'. It includes a command-line
interface which allows users to apply transforms to image files without using
Python. Additionally, we provide a graphical interface within a TorchIO
extension in 3D Slicer to visualize the effects of transforms.

TorchIO was developed to help researchers standardize medical image
processing pipelines and allow them to focus on the deep learning experiments.
It encourages open science, as it supports reproducibility and is version
controlled so that the software can be cited precisely. Due to its modularity,
the library is compatible with other frameworks for deep learning with medical
images.]]></summary>

mechanism to improve the system capacity by realizing the complementary
benefits of both the links. The dynamics of network conditions, such as fog,
dust, and sand storms compound the link switching problem and control
complexity. To address this problem, we initiate the study of deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) for link switching of hybrid FSO/RF systems.
Specifically, in this work, we focus on actor-critic called Actor/Critic-FSO/RF
and Deep-Q network (DQN) called DQN-FSO/RF for FSO/RF link switching under
atmospheric turbulences. To formulate the problem, we define the state, action,
and reward function of a hybrid FSO/RF system. DQN-FSO/RF frequently updates
the deployed policy that interacts with the environment in a hybrid FSO/RF
system, resulting in high switching costs. To overcome this, we lift this
problem to ensemble consensus-based representation learning for deep
reinforcement called DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF. The proposed novel DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF
DRL approach uses consensus learned features representations based on an
ensemble of asynchronous threads to update the deployed policy. Experimental
results corroborate that the proposed DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF's consensus-learned
features switching achieves better performance than Actor/Critic-FSO/RF,
DQN-FSO/RF, and MyOpic for FSO/RF link switching while keeping the switching
cost significantly low.]]></summary>

detection performance of neural networks is mainly due to the SoftMax loss
anisotropy and propensity to produce low entropy probability distributions in
disagreement with the principle of maximum entropy. Current out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection approaches usually do not directly fix the SoftMax loss
drawbacks, but rather build techniques to circumvent it. Unfortunately, those
methods usually produce undesired side effects (e.g., classification accuracy
drop, additional hyperparameters, slower inferences, and collecting extra
data). In the opposite direction, we propose replacing SoftMax loss with a
novel loss function that does not suffer from the mentioned weaknesses. The
proposed IsoMax loss is isotropic (exclusively distance-based) and provides
high entropy posterior probability distributions. Replacing the SoftMax loss by
IsoMax loss requires no model or training changes. Additionally, the models
trained with IsoMax loss produce as fast and energy-efficient inferences as
those trained using SoftMax loss. Moreover, no classification accuracy drop is
observed. The proposed method does not rely on outlier/background data,
hyperparameter tuning, temperature calibration, feature extraction, metric
learning, adversarial training, ensemble procedures, or generative models. Our
experiments showed that IsoMax loss works as a seamless SoftMax loss drop-in
replacement that significantly improves neural networks' OOD detection
performance. Hence, it may be used as a baseline OOD detection approach to be
combined with current or future OOD detection techniques to achieve even higher
results.]]></summary>

variables used to describe a system, one for each intervention setting. They
provide a formal recipe for how to move between the different joint
distributions and make predictions about the variables upon intervening on the
system. Yet, it is difficult to formalise how we may change the underlying
variables used to describe the system, say moving from fine-grained to
coarse-grained variables. Here, we argue that compositionality is a desideratum
for such model transformations and the associated errors: When abstracting a
reference model M iteratively, first obtaining M' and then further simplifying
that to obtain M'', we expect the composite transformation from M to M'' to
exist and its error to be bounded by the errors incurred by each individual
transformation step. Category theory, the study of mathematical objects via
compositional transformations between them, offers a natural language to
develop our framework for model transformations and abstractions. We introduce
a category of finite interventional causal models and, leveraging theory of
enriched categories, prove the desired compositionality properties for our
framework.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detection transformers have recently shown promising object detection results
and attracted increasing attention. However, how to develop effective domain
adaptation techniques to improve its cross-domain performance remains
unexplored and unclear. In this paper, we delve into this topic and empirically
find that direct feature distribution alignment on the CNN backbone only brings
limited improvements, as it does not guarantee domain-invariant sequence
features in the transformer for prediction. To address this issue, we propose a
novel Sequence Feature Alignment (SFA) method that is specially designed for
the adaptation of detection transformers. Technically, SFA consists of a domain
query-based feature alignment (DQFA) module and a token-wise feature alignment
(TDA) module. In DQFA, a novel domain query is used to aggregate and align
global context from the token sequence of both domains. DQFA reduces the domain
discrepancy in global feature representations and object relations when
deploying in the transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. Meanwhile, TDA
aligns token features in the sequence from both domains, which reduces the
domain gaps in local and instance-level feature representations in the
transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. Besides, a novel bipartite
matching consistency loss is proposed to enhance the feature discriminability
for robust object detection. Experiments on three challenging benchmarks show
that SFA outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptive object detection methods.

employs a type of convolutional neural networks (U-nets) and empirical risk
minimization in order to "fit" the unknown operator. In a nutshell, our
approach is based on two ideas: the first is to relate U-nets to multiscale
decompositions such as wavelets, thereby linking them to the existing theory,
and the second is to use the hierarchical structure of U-nets and the low
number of parameters of convolutional neural nets to prove entropy bounds that
are practically useful. A significant difference with the existing works on

tremendous strides, but it still heavily relies on fixed datasets in stationary
environments. Continual learning is a growing field of research that examines
how AI systems can learn sequentially from a continuous stream of linked data
in the same way that biological systems do. Simultaneously, fake media such as
deepfakes and synthetic face images have emerged as significant to current
multimedia technologies. Recently, numerous method has been proposed which can
detect deepfakes with high accuracy. However, they suffer significantly due to
their reliance on fixed datasets in limited evaluation settings. Therefore, in
this work, we apply continuous learning to neural networks' learning dynamics,
emphasizing its potential to increase data efficiency significantly. We propose
Continual Representation using Distillation (CoReD) method that employs the
concept of Continual Learning (CL), Representation Learning (RL), and Knowledge
Distillation (KD). We design CoReD to perform sequential domain adaptation
tasks on new deepfake and GAN-generated synthetic face datasets, while
effectively minimizing the catastrophic forgetting in a teacher-student model
setting. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method is
efficient at domain adaptation to detect low-quality deepfakes videos and
GAN-generated images from several datasets, outperforming the-state-of-art
baseline methods.]]></summary>

search for new science and life beyond Earth calls for spacecraft that can
deliver scientific payloads to geologically rich yet hazardous landing sites.
At the same time, the last four decades of optimization research have put a
suite of powerful optimization tools at the fingertips of the controls
engineer. As we enter the new decade, optimization theory, algorithms, and
software tooling have reached a critical mass to start seeing serious
application in space vehicle guidance and control systems. This survey paper
provides a detailed overview of recent advances, successes, and promising
directions for optimization-based space vehicle control. The considered
applications include planetary landing, rendezvous and proximity operations,
small body landing, constrained reorientation, endo-atmospheric flight
including ascent and re-entry, and orbit transfer and injection. The primary
focus is on the last ten years of progress, which have seen a veritable rise in
the number of applications using three core technologies: lossless
convexification, sequential convex programming, and model predictive control.
The reader will come away with a well-rounded understanding of the
state-of-the-art in each space vehicle control application, and will be well
positioned to tackle important current open problems using convex optimization
as a core technology.]]></summary>

linearized assignment flows for image labeling. An exact formula is derived for
the parameter gradient of any loss function that is constrained by the linear

approximation. This enables us to perform parameter learning by Riemannian
gradient descent in the parameter space, without the need to backpropagate
errors or to solve an adjoint equation, in less than 10 seconds for a

that our method performs as good as highly-tuned machine learning software

of the real hyperrectangle, which describes how to compute the eigenvectors and
eigenvalues of certain matrices arising from hyperrectangles. We show that
these matrices arise naturally when analyzing a number of different algorithmic
tasks such as kernel methods, neural network training, natural language
processing, and the design of algorithms using the polynomial method. We then
use our new technique along with these connections to prove several new
structural results in these areas, including:

$\bullet$ A function is a positive definite Manhattan kernel if and only if
it is a completely monotone function. These kernels are widely used across
machine learning; one example is the Laplace kernel which is widely used in
machine learning for chemistry.

$\bullet$ A function transforms Manhattan distances to Manhattan distances if
and only if it is a Bernstein function. This completes the theory of Manhattan
to Manhattan metric transforms initiated by Assouad in 1980.

$\bullet$ A function applied entry-wise to any square matrix of rank $r$
always results in a matrix of rank $< 2^{r-1}$ if and only if it is a
polynomial of sufficiently low degree. This gives a converse to a key lemma
used by the polynomial method in algorithm design.

Our work includes a sophisticated combination of techniques from different
fields, including metric embeddings, the polynomial method, and group

past knowledge while being trained on new tasks. Common techniques to handle CF
include regularization of the weights (using, e.g., their importance on past
tasks), and rehearsal strategies, where the network is constantly re-trained on
past data. Generative models have also been applied for the latter, in order to
have endless sources of data. In this paper, we propose a novel method that
combines the strengths of regularization and generative-based rehearsal
approaches. Our generative model consists of a normalizing flow (NF), a
probabilistic and invertible neural network, trained on the internal embeddings
of the network. By keeping a single NF conditioned on the task, we show that
our memory overhead remains constant. In addition, exploiting the invertibility
of the NF, we propose a simple approach to regularize the network's embeddings
with respect to past tasks. We show that our method performs favorably with
respect to state-of-the-art approaches in the literature, with bounded

employing output stationary systolic array in support of many-to-one traffic.
The gather packet will collect the data from the intermediate nodes eventually

novel concepts with just a handful of labelled data. To classify query
instances from novel classes encountered at test-time, they only require a
support set composed of a few labelled samples. FSL benchmarks commonly assume
that those queries come from the same distribution as instances in the support
set. However, in a realistic set-ting, data distribution is plausibly subject
to change, a situation referred to as Distribution Shift (DS). The present work
addresses the new and challenging problem of Few-Shot Learning under
Support/Query Shift (FSQS) i.e., when support and query instances are sampled
from related but different distributions. Our contributions are the following.
First, we release a testbed for FSQS, including datasets, relevant baselines
and a protocol for a rigorous and reproducible evaluation. Second, we observe
that well-established FSL algorithms unsurprisingly suffer from a considerable
drop in accuracy when facing FSQS, stressing the significance of our study.
Finally, we show that transductive algorithms can limit the inopportune effect
of DS. In particular, we study both the role of Batch-Normalization and Optimal
Transport (OT) in aligning distributions, bridging Unsupervised Domain
Adaptation with FSL. This results in a new method that efficiently combines OT
with the celebrated Prototypical Networks. We bring compelling experiments
demonstrating the advantage of our method. Our work opens an exciting line of
research by providing a testbed and strong baselines. Our code is available at

unfamiliarity with ML features, lack of contextual information, and the need

incorporates ML explanations into clinicians' decision-making workflow. The
system includes a novel hierarchical display of contribution-based feature
explanations and enriched interactions that connect the dots between ML

determine the correctness of the behaviour or output of the software under test
(SUT), a situation known as the oracle problem. An example of an area facing
the oracle problem is automatic image classification, using machine learning to
classify an input image as one of a set of predefined classes. An approach to
software testing that alleviates the oracle problem is metamorphic testing
(MT). While traditional software testing examines the correctness of individual
test cases, MT instead examines the relations amongst multiple executions of
test cases and their outputs. These relations are called metamorphic relations
(MRs): if an MR is found to be violated, then a fault must exist in the SUT.
This paper examines the problem of classifying images containing visually
hidden markers called Artcodes, and applies MT to verify and enhance the
trained classifiers. This paper further examines two MRs, Separation and
Occlusion, and reports on their capability in verifying the image
classification using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in conjunction with
three other statistical analysis methods: t-test (for unequal variances),
Kruskal-Wallis test, and Dunnett's test. In addition to our previously-studied
classifier, that used Random Forests, we introduce a new classifier that uses a
support vector machine, and present its MR-augmented version. Experimental
evaluations across a number of performance metrics show that the augmented
classifiers can achieve better performance than non-augmented classifiers. This
paper also analyses how the enhanced performance is obtained.]]></summary>

positive and negative samples to contrast. However, existing approaches rely
heavily on the short-range spatiotemporal salience to form clip-level
contrastive signals, thus limit themselves from using global context. In this
paper, we propose a new video-level contrastive learning method based on
segments to formulate positive pairs. Our formulation is able to capture global
context in a video, thus robust to temporal content change. We also incorporate
a temporal order regularization term to enforce the inherent sequential
structure of videos. Extensive experiments show that our video-level
contrastive learning framework (VCLR) is able to outperform previous
state-of-the-arts on five video datasets for downstream action classification,
action localization and video retrieval. Code is available at

separating video content into static and dynamic components. Most of the
previous work utilizing motion is deterministic but there are stochastic
methods that can model the inherent uncertainty of the future. Existing
stochastic models either do not reason about motion explicitly or make limiting
assumptions about the static part. In this paper, we reason about appearance
and motion in the video stochastically by predicting the future based on the
motion history. Explicit reasoning about motion without history already reaches
the performance of current stochastic models. The motion history further
improves the results by allowing to predict consistent dynamics several frames
into the future. Our model performs comparably to the state-of-the-art models
on the generic video prediction datasets, however, significantly outperforms
them on two challenging real-world autonomous driving datasets with complex

off. Among these approaches, contrastive learning has seen tremendous progress
and led to state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we construct a novel
probabilistic graphical model that effectively incorporates the low rank
promoting prior into the framework of contrastive learning, referred to as
LORAC. In contrast to the existing conventional self-supervised approaches that
only considers independent learning, our hypothesis explicitly requires that
all the samples belonging to the same instance class lie on the same subspace
with small dimension. This heuristic poses particular joint learning
constraints to reduce the degree of freedom of the problem during the search of
the optimal network parameterization. Most importantly, we argue that the low
rank prior employed here is not unique, and many different priors can be
invoked in a similar probabilistic way, corresponding to different hypotheses
about underlying truth behind the contrastive features. Empirical evidences
show that the proposed algorithm clearly surpasses the state-of-the-art
approaches on multiple benchmarks, including image classification, object

synthesis (SVS) system. In recent years, DNNs have been utilized in statistical
parametric SVS systems, and DNN-based SVS systems have demonstrated better
performance than conventional hidden Markov model-based ones. SVS systems are
required to synthesize a singing voice with pitch and timing that strictly
follow a given musical score. Additionally, singing expressions that are not
described on the musical score, such as vibrato and timing fluctuations, should
be reproduced. The proposed system is composed of four modules: a time-lag
model, a duration model, an acoustic model, and a vocoder, and singing voices
can be synthesized taking these characteristics of singing voices into account.
To better model a singing voice, the proposed system incorporates improved
approaches to modeling pitch and vibrato and better training criteria into the
acoustic model. In addition, we incorporated PeriodNet, a non-autoregressive
neural vocoder with robustness for the pitch, into our systems to generate a
high-fidelity singing voice waveform. Moreover, we propose automatic pitch
correction techniques for DNN-based SVS to synthesize singing voices with
correct pitch even if the training data has out-of-tune phrases. Experimental
results show our system can synthesize a singing voice with better timing, more
natural vibrato, and correct pitch, and it can achieve better mean opinion
scores in subjective evaluation tests.]]></summary>

where our goal is to transform a pre-trained model to the target's domain data.
While the source domain includes labels, we assume an unlabelled target domain,
as it happens in real-world applications. Then, we present an adversarial
learning approach that is adapted for training on the device with limited
resources. Since visual domain adaptation, i.e. neural network training, has
not been previously explored for resource-constrained hardware, we present the
first feasibility study for image-based depth estimation. Our experiments show
that visual domain adaptation is relevant only for efficient network
architectures and training sets at the order of a few hundred samples. Models

a large-scale operator infrastructure. The evaluation results show that the
proposed hybrid DRL-heuristic approach is more robust and reliable in case of
unpredictable network load changes than pure DRL as it reduces the performance
degradation. These results are follow-ups for a series of recent research we

stability, and efficiency of a city transportation system. In reality, it is
challenging to produce accurate traffic forecasts due to the complex and
dynamic spatiotemporal correlations. Most existing works only consider partial
characteristics and features of traffic data, and result in unsatisfactory
performances on modeling and forecasting. In this paper, we propose a periodic
spatial-temporal deep neural network (PSTN) with three pivotal modules to
improve the forecasting performance of traffic conditions through a novel
integration of three types of information. First, the historical traffic
information is folded and fed into a module consisting of a graph convolutional
network and a temporal convolutional network. Second, the recent traffic
information together with the historical output passes through the second
module consisting of a graph convolutional network and a gated recurrent unit
framework. Finally, a multi-layer perceptron is applied to process the
auxiliary road attributes and output the final predictions. Experimental
results on two publicly accessible real-world urban traffic data sets show that
the proposed PSTN outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmarks by significant

example, the discovery of novel materials. Until now, however, these artificial
intelligence techniques have fallen short of discovering the full differential
equation of an experimental physical system. Here we show that a dynamical
neural network, trained on a minimal amount of data, can predict the behavior
of spintronic devices with high accuracy and an extremely efficient simulation
time, compared to the micromagnetic simulations that are usually employed to
model them. For this purpose, we re-frame the formalism of Neural Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) to the constraints of spintronics: few measured
outputs, multiple inputs and internal parameters. We demonstrate with
Spin-Neural ODEs an acceleration factor over 200 compared to micromagnetic
simulations for a complex problem -- the simulation of a reservoir computer
made of magnetic skyrmions (20 minutes compared to three days). In a second
realization, we show that we can predict the noisy response of experimental
spintronic nano-oscillators to varying inputs after training Spin-Neural ODEs
on five milliseconds of their measured response to different excitations.
Spin-Neural ODE is a disruptive tool for developing spintronic applications in
complement to micromagnetic simulations, which are time-consuming and cannot
fit experiments when noise or imperfections are present. Spin-Neural ODE can

distributed machine learning across edge devices. A single neural network (NN)
that optimises a global objective is generally learned in most work in FL,
which could be suboptimal for edge devices. Although works finding a NN
personalised for edge device specific tasks exist, they lack generalisation
and/or convergence guarantees. In this paper, a novel communication efficient
FL algorithm for personalised learning in a wireless setting with guarantees is
presented. The algorithm relies on finding a ``better`` empirical estimate of
losses at each device, using a weighted average of the losses across different
devices. It is devised from a Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) bound on the
true loss in terms of the proposed empirical loss and is bounded by (i) the
Rademacher complexity, (ii) the discrepancy, (iii) and a penalty term. Using a
signed gradient feedback to find a personalised NN at each device, it is also
proven to converge in a Rayleigh flat fading (in the uplink) channel, at a rate
of the order max{1/SNR,1/sqrt(T)} Experimental results show that the proposed
algorithm outperforms locally trained devices as well as the conventionally
used FedAvg and FedSGD algorithms under practical SNR regimes.]]></summary>

as input to learn to predict both action concepts and auxiliary descriptors
e.g., object descriptors. So-called hallucination streams are trained to
predict auxiliary cues, simultaneously fed into classification layers, and then
hallucinated at the testing stage to aid network. We design and hallucinate two
descriptors, one leveraging four popular object detectors applied to training
videos, and the other leveraging image- and video-level saliency detectors. The
first descriptor encodes the detector- and ImageNet-wise class prediction
scores, confidence scores, and spatial locations of bounding boxes and frame
indexes to capture the spatio-temporal distribution of features per video.
Another descriptor encodes spatio-angular gradient distributions of saliency
maps and intensity patterns. Inspired by the characteristic function of the
probability distribution, we capture four statistical moments on the above
intermediate descriptors. As numbers of coefficients in the mean, covariance,
coskewness and cokurtotsis grow linearly, quadratically, cubically and
quartically w.r.t. the dimension of feature vectors, we describe the covariance
matrix by its leading n' eigenvectors (so-called subspace) and we capture
skewness/kurtosis rather than costly coskewness/cokurtosis. We obtain state of

data-driven and adaptive control. Though this trade-off has been studied for
multi-armed bandits, reinforcement learning (RL) for finite Markov chains, and
RL for linear control systems; it is less well-studied for learning-based
control of nonlinear control systems. A significant theoretical challenge in
the nonlinear setting is that, unlike the linear case, there is no explicit
characterization of an optimal controller for a given set of cost and system
parameters. We propose in this paper the use of a finite-horizon oracle
controller with perfect knowledge of all system parameters as a reference for
optimal control actions. First, this allows us to propose a new regret notion
with respect to this oracle finite-horizon controller. Second, this allows us
to develop learning-based policies that we prove achieve low regret (i.e.,
square-root regret up to a log-squared factor) with respect to this oracle
finite-horizon controller. This policy is developed in the context of
learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC). We conduct a statistical
analysis to prove finite sample concentration bounds for the estimation step of
our policy, and then we perform a control-theoretic analysis using techniques
from MPC- and optimization-theory to show this policy ensures closed-loop
stability and achieves low regret. We conclude with numerical experiments on a
model of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems that show
the low regret of our policy in a setting where the cost function is
partially-unknown to the controller.]]></summary>

information for accurate liver tumor segmentation (LiTS). State-of-the-art
multi-phase LiTS methods usually fused cross-phase features through
phase-weighted summation or channel-attention based concatenation. However,
these methods ignored the spatial (pixel-wise) relationships between different
phases, hence leading to insufficient feature integration. In addition, the
performance of existing methods remains subject to the uncertainty in
segmentation, which is particularly acute in tumor boundary regions. In this
work, we propose a novel LiTS method to adequately aggregate multi-phase
information and refine uncertain region segmentation. To this end, we introduce
a spatial aggregation module (SAM), which encourages per-pixel interactions
between different phases, to make full use of cross-phase information.
Moreover, we devise an uncertain region inpainting module (URIM) to refine
uncertain pixels using neighboring discriminative features. Experiments on an
in-house multi-phase CT dataset of focal liver lesions (MPCT-FLLs) demonstrate
that our method achieves promising liver tumor segmentation and outperforms

model high-dimensional feature distributions from a subset of examples drawn
from the target distribution. Naturally, they perform well at generalizing
within the limits of their target function, but they often fail to generalize
outside of the explicitly learned feature space. It is therefore an open
research topic whether and how neural network-based architectures can be
deployed for systematic reasoning. Many studies have shown evidence for poor
generalization, but they often work with abstract data or are limited to
single-channel input. Humans, however, learn and interact through a combination
of multiple sensory modalities, and rarely rely on just one. To investigate
compositional generalization in a multimodal setting, we generate an extensible
dataset with multimodal input sequences from simulation. We investigate the
influence of the underlying training data distribution on compostional
generalization in a minimal LSTM-based network trained in a supervised, time
continuous setting. We find compositional generalization to fail in simple
setups while improving with the number of objects, actions, and particularly
with a lot of color overlaps between objects. Furthermore, multimodality
strongly improves compositional generalization in settings where a pure vision

interplay between large-width asymptotics for deep Gaussian neural networks
(NNs), i.e. deep NNs with Gaussian-distributed weights, and classes of Gaussian
stochastic processes (SPs). Such an interplay has proved to be critical in
several contexts of practical interest, e.g. Bayesian inference under Gaussian
SP priors, kernel regression for infinite-wide deep NNs trained via gradient
descent, and information propagation within infinite-wide NNs. Motivated by
empirical analysis, showing the potential of replacing Gaussian distributions
with Stable distributions for the NN's weights, in this paper we investigate
large-width asymptotics for (fully connected) feed-forward deep Stable NNs,
i.e. deep NNs with Stable-distributed weights. First, we show that as the width
goes to infinity jointly over the NN's layers, a suitable rescaled deep Stable
NN converges weakly to a Stable SP whose distribution is characterized
recursively through the NN's layers. Because of the non-triangular NN's
structure, this is a non-standard asymptotic problem, to which we propose a
novel and self-contained inductive approach, which may be of independent
interest. Then, we establish sup-norm convergence rates of a deep Stable NN to
a Stable SP, quantifying the critical difference between the settings of
``joint growth" and ``sequential growth" of the width over the NN's layers. Our
work extends recent results on infinite-wide limits for deep Gaussian NNs to

distributed clusters. Crucially, such systems can be compromised when some of
the computing devices exhibit abnormal (Byzantine) behavior and return
arbitrary results to the parameter server (PS). This behavior may be attributed
to a plethora of reasons including system failures and orchestrated attacks.
Existing work suggests robust aggregation and/or computational redundancy to
alleviate the effect of distorted gradients. However, most of these schemes are
ineffective when an adversary knows the task assignment and can judiciously
choose the attacked workers to induce maximal damage. Our proposed method Aspis
assigns gradient computations to worker nodes using a subset-based assignment
which allows for multiple consistency checks on the behavior of a worker node.
Examination of the calculated gradients and post-processing (clique-finding in
an appropriately constructed graph) by the central node allows for efficient
detection and subsequent exclusion of adversaries from the training process. We
prove the Byzantine resilience and detection guarantees of Aspis under weak and
strong attacks and extensively evaluate the system on various large-scale
training scenarios. The main metric for our experiments is the test accuracy
for which we demonstrate significant improvement of about 30% compared to many
state-of-the-art approaches on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The corresponding
reduction of the fraction of corrupted gradients ranges from 16% to 98%.]]></summary>

acceleration for computationally intensive tasks like machine learning and
computer vision. While these complex workloads can be accelerated by commercial
GPUs, domain-specific hardware is far more optimal when needing to meet the
stringent memory, throughput, and power constraints of mobile and embedded
devices. This paper proposes and evaluates a Binary-Enabled Architecture for
Neural Network Acceleration (BEANNA), a neural network hardware accelerator
capable of processing both floating point and binary network layers. Through
the use of a novel 16x16 systolic array based matrix multiplier with processing
elements that compute both floating point and binary multiply-adds, BEANNA
seamlessly switches between high precision floating point and binary neural
network layers. Running at a clock speed of 100MHz, BEANNA achieves a peak
throughput of 52.8 GigaOps/second when operating in high precision mode, and
820 GigaOps/second when operating in binary mode. Evaluation of BEANNA was
performed by comparing a hybrid network with floating point outer layers and
binary hidden layers to a network with only floating point layers. The hybrid
network accelerated using BEANNA achieved a 194% throughput increase, a 68%

propose SimpModeling, a novel sketch-based system for helping users, especially
amateur users, easily model 3D animalmorphic heads - a prevalent kind of heads
in character design. Although sketching provides an easy way to depict desired
shapes, it is challenging to infer dense geometric information from sparse line
drawings. Recently, deepnet-based approaches have been taken to address this
challenge and try to produce rich geometric details from very few strokes.
However, while such methods reduce users' workload, they would cause less
controllability of target shapes. This is mainly due to the uncertainty of the
neural prediction. Our system tackles this issue and provides good
controllability from three aspects: 1) we separate coarse shape design and
geometric detail specification into two stages and respectively provide
different sketching means; 2) in coarse shape designing, sketches are used for
both shape inference and geometric constraints to determine global geometry,
and in geometric detail crafting, sketches are used for carving surface
details; 3) in both stages, we use the advanced implicit-based shape inference
methods, which have strong ability to handle the domain gap between freehand
sketches and synthetic ones used for training. Experimental results confirm the
effectiveness of our method and the usability of our interactive system. We
also contribute to a dataset of high-quality 3D animal heads, which are
manually created by artists.]]></summary>

advancing the understanding of tumor progression, tumor micro-environment, and
their underpinning biological processes. So far, these approaches have focused
on extracting information associated with annotations. In this work, we ask how
much information can be learned from the tissue architecture itself.

We present an adversarial learning model to extract feature representations
of cancer tissue, without the need for manual annotations. We show that these
representations are able to identify a variety of morphological characteristics
across three cancer types: Breast, colon, and lung. This is supported by 1) the
separation of morphologic characteristics in the latent space; 2) the ability
to classify tissue type with logistic regression using latent representations,
with an AUC of 0.97 and 85% accuracy, comparable to supervised deep models; 3)
the ability to predict the presence of tumor in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) using
multiple instance learning (MIL), achieving an AUC of 0.98 and 94% accuracy.

Our results show that our model captures distinct phenotypic characteristics
of real tissue samples, paving the way for further understanding of tumor
progression and tumor micro-environment, and ultimately refining
histopathological classification for diagnosis and treatment. The code and

during a seizure, is critical for management of epilepsy patients. Inter-rater
reliability using qualitative visual analysis is often poor for semiological
features. Therefore, automatic and quantitative analysis of video-recorded
seizures is needed for objective assessment.

We present GESTURES, a novel architecture combining convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn deep
representations of arbitrarily long videos of epileptic seizures.

We use a spatiotemporal CNN (STCNN) pre-trained on large human action
recognition (HAR) datasets to extract features from short snippets (approx. 0.5
s) sampled from seizure videos. We then train an RNN to learn seizure-level
representations from the sequence of features.

We curated a dataset of seizure videos from 68 patients and evaluated
GESTURES on its ability to classify seizures into focal onset seizures (FOSs)
(N = 106) vs. focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (TCSs) (N = 77),
obtaining an accuracy of 98.9% using bidirectional long short-term memory
(BLSTM) units.

We demonstrate that an STCNN trained on a HAR dataset can be used in
combination with an RNN to accurately represent arbitrarily long videos of
seizures. GESTURES can provide accurate seizure classification by modeling

detection performance of neural networks is mainly due to the SoftMax loss
anisotropy and propensity to produce low entropy probability distributions in
disagreement with the principle of maximum entropy. Current out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection approaches usually do not directly fix the SoftMax loss
drawbacks, but rather build techniques to circumvent it. Unfortunately, those
methods usually produce undesired side effects (e.g., classification accuracy
drop, additional hyperparameters, slower inferences, and collecting extra
data). In the opposite direction, we propose replacing SoftMax loss with a
novel loss function that does not suffer from the mentioned weaknesses. The
proposed IsoMax loss is isotropic (exclusively distance-based) and provides
high entropy posterior probability distributions. Replacing the SoftMax loss by
IsoMax loss requires no model or training changes. Additionally, the models
trained with IsoMax loss produce as fast and energy-efficient inferences as
those trained using SoftMax loss. Moreover, no classification accuracy drop is
observed. The proposed method does not rely on outlier/background data,
hyperparameter tuning, temperature calibration, feature extraction, metric
learning, adversarial training, ensemble procedures, or generative models. Our
experiments showed that IsoMax loss works as a seamless SoftMax loss drop-in
replacement that significantly improves neural networks' OOD detection
performance. Hence, it may be used as a baseline OOD detection approach to be
combined with current or future OOD detection techniques to achieve even higher

tasks involving time sequential data such as speech recognition. However, it is
difficult to deploy these networks on hardware to achieve high throughput and
low latency because the fully-connected structure makes LSTM networks a
memory-bounded algorithm. Previous work in LSTM accelerators either exploited
weight spatial sparsity or temporal sparsity. In this paper, we present a new
accelerator called "Spartus" that exploits spatio-temporal sparsity to achieve
ultra-low latency inference. The spatial sparsity was induced using our
proposed pruning method called Column-Balanced Targeted Dropout (CBTD) that
leads to structured sparse weight matrices benefiting workload balance. It
achieved up to 96% weight sparsity with negligible accuracy difference for an
LSTM network trained on a TIMIT phone recognition task. To induce temporal
sparsity in LSTM, we create the DeltaLSTM by extending the previous DeltaGRU
method to the LSTM network. This combined sparsity saves on weight memory
access and associated arithmetic operations simultaneously. Spartus was
implemented on a Xilinx Zynq-7100 FPGA. The per-sample latency for a single
DeltaLSTM layer of 1024 neurons running on Spartus is 1 us. Spartus achieved
9.4 TOp/s effective batch-1 throughput and 1.1 TOp/J energy efficiency, which

and attracted increasing attention. However, how to develop effective domain
adaptation techniques to improve its cross-domain performance remains
unexplored and unclear. In this paper, we delve into this topic and empirically
find that direct feature distribution alignment on the CNN backbone only brings
limited improvements, as it does not guarantee domain-invariant sequence
features in the transformer for prediction. To address this issue, we propose a
novel Sequence Feature Alignment (SFA) method that is specially designed for
the adaptation of detection transformers. Technically, SFA consists of a domain
query-based feature alignment (DQFA) module and a token-wise feature alignment
(TDA) module. In DQFA, a novel domain query is used to aggregate and align
global context from the token sequence of both domains. DQFA reduces the domain
discrepancy in global feature representations and object relations when
deploying in the transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. Meanwhile, TDA
aligns token features in the sequence from both domains, which reduces the
domain gaps in local and instance-level feature representations in the
transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. Besides, a novel bipartite
matching consistency loss is proposed to enhance the feature discriminability
for robust object detection. Experiments on three challenging benchmarks show
that SFA outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptive object detection methods.

volumes.

We present TorchIO, an open-source Python library to enable efficient
loading, preprocessing, augmentation and patch-based sampling of medical images
for deep learning. TorchIO follows the style of PyTorch and integrates standard
medical image processing libraries to efficiently process images during
training of neural networks. TorchIO transforms can be composed, reproduced,
traced and extended. We provide multiple generic preprocessing and augmentation
operations as well as simulation of MRI-specific artifacts.

Source code, comprehensive tutorials and extensive documentation for TorchIO
can be found at https://torchio.rtfd.io/. The package can be installed from the
Python Package Index running 'pip install torchio'. It includes a command-line
interface which allows users to apply transforms to image files without using
Python. Additionally, we provide a graphical interface within a TorchIO
extension in 3D Slicer to visualize the effects of transforms.

TorchIO was developed to help researchers standardize medical image
processing pipelines and allow them to focus on the deep learning experiments.
It encourages open science, as it supports reproducibility and is version
controlled so that the software can be cited precisely. Due to its modularity,
the library is compatible with other frameworks for deep learning with medical
images.]]></summary>

models for computer vision tasks. ImageNet-21K dataset, which is bigger and
more diverse, is used less frequently for pretraining, mainly due to its
complexity, low accessibility, and underestimation of its added value. This
paper aims to close this gap, and make high-quality efficient pretraining on
ImageNet-21K available for everyone. Via a dedicated preprocessing stage,
utilization of WordNet hierarchical structure, and a novel training scheme
called semantic softmax, we show that various models significantly benefit from
ImageNet-21K pretraining on numerous datasets and tasks, including small
mobile-oriented models. We also show that we outperform previous ImageNet-21K
pretraining schemes for prominent new models like ViT and Mixer. Our proposed
pretraining pipeline is efficient, accessible, and leads to SoTA reproducible

can easily be added to an existing neural codec. The basic idea of our B-frame

reference frame and then use it together with an existing P-frame codec to
encode the input B-frame. Our studies show that the interpolated frame is a
much better reference for the P-frame codec compared to using the previous

fps with the extreme motion to the research community for video frame
interpolation (VFI), and propose an extreme VFI network, called XVFI-Net, that
first handles the VFI for 4K videos with large motion. The XVFI-Net is based on
a recursive multi-scale shared structure that consists of two cascaded modules
for bidirectional optical flow learning between two input frames (BiOF-I) and
for bidirectional optical flow learning from target to input frames (BiOF-T).
The optical flows are stably approximated by a complementary flow reversal
(CFR) proposed in BiOF-T module. During inference, the BiOF-I module can start
at any scale of input while the BiOF-T module only operates at the original
input scale so that the inference can be accelerated while maintaining highly
accurate VFI performance. Extensive experimental results show that our XVFI-Net
can successfully capture the essential information of objects with extremely
large motions and complex textures while the state-of-the-art methods exhibit
poor performance. Furthermore, our XVFI-Net framework also performs comparably
on the previous lower resolution benchmark dataset, which shows a robustness of
our algorithm as well. All source codes, pre-trained models, and proposed

classification and regression techniques used in recent applications with
UAV-acquired data. For that, a total of 232 papers published in international
scientific journal databases was examined. We gathered the published material
and evaluated their characteristics regarding application, sensor, and
technique used. We relate how DL presents promising results and has the
potential for processing tasks associated with UAV-based image data. Lastly, we
project future perspectives, commentating on prominent DL paths to be explored
in the UAV remote sensing field. Our revision consists of a friendly-approach

high-resolution 3D images over time for living model organisms. To be able to
image even large specimens, techniques like multi-view light-sheet imaging
record different orientations at each time point that can then be fused into a
single high-quality volume. Based on measured point spread functions (PSF),
deconvolution and content fusion are able to largely revert the inevitable
degradation occurring during the imaging process. Classical multi-view
deconvolution and fusion methods mainly use iterative procedures and
content-based averaging. Lately, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been
deployed to approach 3D single-view deconvolution microscopy, but the
multi-view case waits to be studied. We investigated the efficacy of CNN-based
multi-view deconvolution and fusion with two synthetic data sets that mimic
developing embryos and involve either two or four complementary 3D views.
Compared with classical state-of-the-art methods, the proposed semi- and
self-supervised models achieve competitive and superior deconvolution and
fusion quality in the two-view and quad-view cases, respectively.]]></summary>

inpainting. However, it is still very challenging for a neural network to
generate realistic image details and textures, due to its inherent spectral

`structure first detail next' workflow for image inpainting. To this end, we
propose to build a Pyramid Generator by stacking several sub-generators, where
lower-layer sub-generators focus on restoring image structures while the
higher-layer sub-generators emphasize image details. Given an input image, it
will be gradually restored by going through the entire pyramid in a bottom-up
fashion. Particularly, our approach has a learning scheme of progressively
increasing hole size, which allows it to restore large-hole images. In
addition, our method could fully exploit the benefits of learning with
high-resolution images, and hence is suitable for high-resolution image
inpainting. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets have validated
the effectiveness of our approach compared with state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

video foreground-background separation and face modeling. This paper examines

which leverages a voxel-based representation to parameterize the surrounding
geometry of interest points. Instead of using a predefined fixed-size local
support in voxelization, which potentially limits the access of richer local
geometry information, we propose to learn the support size in a data-driven
manner. To this end, we design a differentiable voxelization module that can
back-propagate gradients to the support size optimization. To optimize
descriptor similarity, the prior 3D CNN work and other supervised methods
require abundant correspondence labels or pose annotations of point clouds for
crafting metric learning losses. Differently, we show that unsupervised
learning of descriptor similarity can be achieved by performing geometric
registration in networks. Our learning objectives consider descriptor
similarity both across and within point clouds without supervision. Through
extensive experiments on point cloud registration benchmarks, we show that our
learned descriptors yield superior performance over existing unsupervised
methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fully convolutional network (FCN) has dominated salient object detection
for a long period. However, the locality of CNN requires the model deep enough
to have a global receptive field and such a deep model always leads to the loss
of local details. In this paper, we introduce a new attention-based encoder,
vision transformer, into salient object detection to ensure the globalization
of the representations from shallow to deep layers. With the global view in
very shallow layers, the transformer encoder preserves more local
representations to recover the spatial details in final saliency maps. Besides,
as each layer can capture a global view of its previous layer, adjacent layers
can implicitly maximize the representation differences and minimize the
redundant features, making that every output feature of transformer layers
contributes uniquely for final prediction. To decode features from the
transformer, we propose a simple yet effective deeply-transformed decoder. The
decoder densely decodes and upsamples the transformer features, generating the
final saliency map with less noise injection. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms other FCN-based and transformer-based
methods in five benchmarks by a large margin, with an average of 12.17%
improvement in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Code will be available at

images for use in marketing campaigns. To assist advertisers in navigating such
third party libraries, we study the problem of automatically fetching relevant
ad images given the ad text (via a short textual query for images). Motivated
by our observations in logged data on ad image search queries (given ad text),
we formulate a keyword extraction problem, where a keyword extracted from the
ad text (or its augmented version) serves as the ad image query. In this
context, we propose VisualTextRank: an unsupervised method to (i) augment input
ad text using semantically similar ads, and (ii) extract the image query from
the augmented ad text. VisualTextRank builds on prior work on graph based
context extraction (biased TextRank in particular) by leveraging both the text
and image of similar ads for better keyword extraction, and using advertiser
category specific biasing with sentence-BERT embeddings. Using data collected
from the Verizon Media Native (Yahoo Gemini) ad platform's stock image search
feature for onboarding advertisers, we demonstrate the superiority of
VisualTextRank compared to competitive keyword extraction baselines (including
an $11\%$ accuracy lift over biased TextRank). For the case when the stock
image library is restricted to English queries, we show the effectiveness of
VisualTextRank on multilingual ads (translated to English) while leveraging

learning field, and recently been adapted to video domain. One of the greatest
advantages of contrastive learning is that it allows us to flexibly define
powerful loss objectives as long as we can find a reasonable way to formulate
positive and negative samples to contrast. However, existing approaches rely
heavily on the short-range spatiotemporal salience to form clip-level
contrastive signals, thus limit themselves from using global context. In this
paper, we propose a new video-level contrastive learning method based on
segments to formulate positive pairs. Our formulation is able to capture global
context in a video, thus robust to temporal content change. We also incorporate
a temporal order regularization term to enforce the inherent sequential
structure of videos. Extensive experiments show that our video-level
contrastive learning framework (VCLR) is able to outperform previous

action localization and video retrieval. Code is available at

graphics and vision, such as modeling human bodies, faces, and hands. However,
the construction of these parametric models is often tedious, as it requires
heavy manual tweaking, and they struggle to represent additional complexity and
details such as wrinkles or clothing. To this end, we propose Neural Parametric
Models (NPMs), a novel, learned alternative to traditional, parametric 3D
models, which does not require hand-crafted, object-specific constraints. In
particular, we learn to disentangle 4D dynamics into latent-space
representations of shape and pose, leveraging the flexibility of recent
developments in learned implicit functions. Crucially, once learned, our neural
parametric models of shape and pose enable optimization over the learned spaces
to fit to new observations, similar to the fitting of a traditional parametric
model, e.g., SMPL. This enables NPMs to achieve a significantly more accurate
and detailed representation of observed deformable sequences. We show that NPMs
improve notably over both parametric and non-parametric state of the art in
reconstruction and tracking of monocular depth sequences of clothed humans and
hands. Latent-space interpolation as well as shape/pose transfer experiments
further demonstrate the usefulness of NPMs. Code is publicly available at

correspondences between map and frame objects, and probabilistic absolute

this paper, we cast point cloud registration into a planning problem in
reinforcement learning, which can seek the transformation between the source

registration process as a Markov decision process (MDP), we develop a latent
dynamic model of point clouds, consisting of a transformation network and
evaluation network. The transformation network aims to predict the new
transformed feature of the point cloud after performing a rigid transformation
(i.e., action) on it while the evaluation network aims to predict the alignment
precision between the transformed source point cloud and target point cloud as
the reward signal. Once the dynamic model of the point cloud is trained, we
employ the cross-entropy method (CEM) to iteratively update the planning policy
by maximizing the rewards in the point cloud registration process. Thus, the
optimal policy, i.e., the transformation between the source and target point
clouds, can be obtained via gradually narrowing the search space of the
transformation. Experimental results on ModelNet40 and 7Scene benchmark

government sectors has caused significant privacy concerns for individuals. A
recent and popular approach to address these privacy concerns is to employ
evasion attacks against the metric embedding networks powering facial
recognition systems. Face obfuscation systems generate imperceptible
perturbations, when added to an image, cause the facial recognition system to
misidentify the user. The key to these approaches is the generation of
perturbations using a pre-trained metric embedding network followed by their
application to an online system, whose model might be proprietary. This
dependence of face obfuscation on metric embedding networks, which are known to
be unfair in the context of facial recognition, surfaces the question of
demographic fairness -- \textit{are there demographic disparities in the
performance of face obfuscation systems?} To address this question, we perform
an analytical and empirical exploration of the performance of recent face
obfuscation systems that rely on deep embedding networks. We find that metric
embedding networks are demographically aware; they cluster faces in the
embedding space based on their demographic attributes. We observe that this
effect carries through to the face obfuscation systems: faces belonging to
minority groups incur reduced utility compared to those from majority groups.
For example, the disparity in average obfuscation success rate on the online
Face++ API can reach up to 20 percentage points. Further, for some demographic
groups, the average perturbation size increases by up to 17\% when choosing a
target identity belonging to a different demographic group versus the same
demographic group. Finally, we present a simple analytical model to provide

of autonomous driving. In this paper, we study a novel setting of this problem:
model-free single-object tracking (SOT), which takes the object state in the
first frame as input, and jointly solves state estimation and tracking in
subsequent frames. The main purpose for this new setting is to break the strong
limitation of the popular "detection and tracking" scheme in multi-object
tracking. Moreover, we notice that shape completion by overlaying the point
clouds, which is a by-product of our proposed task, not only improves the
performance of state estimation but also has numerous applications. As no
benchmark for this task is available so far, we construct a new dataset
LiDAR-SOT and corresponding evaluation protocols based on the Waymo Open
dataset. We then propose an optimization-based algorithm called SOTracker
involving point cloud registration, vehicle shapes, correspondence, and motion
priors. Our quantitative and qualitative results prove the effectiveness of our
SOTracker and reveal the challenging cases for SOT in point clouds, including
the sparsity of LiDAR data, abrupt motion variation, etc. Finally, we also
explore how the proposed task and algorithm may benefit other autonomous
driving applications, including simulating LiDAR scans, generating motion data,
and annotating optical flow. The code and protocols for our benchmark and
algorithm are available at https://github.com/TuSimple/LiDAR_SOT/. A video

method for efficient inference. Conventional methods require the consistency of
datasets for bitwidth search and model deployment to guarantee the policy
optimality, leading to heavy search cost on challenging largescale datasets in
realistic applications. On the contrary, our GMPQ searches the
mixed-quantization policy that can be generalized to largescale datasets with
only a small amount of data, so that the search cost is significantly reduced
without performance degradation. Specifically, we observe that locating network
attribution correctly is general ability for accurate visual analysis across
different data distribution. Therefore, despite of pursuing higher model
accuracy and complexity, we preserve attribution rank consistency between the
quantized models and their full-precision counterparts via efficient
capacity-aware attribution imitation for generalizable mixed-precision
quantization strategy search. Extensive experiments show that our method
obtains competitive accuracy-complexity trade-off compared with the
state-of-the-art mixed-precision networks in significantly reduced search cost.

Traditionally, creating a GAN model has required the collection of a
large-scale dataset of exemplars and specialized knowledge in deep learning. In
contrast, sketching is possibly the most universally accessible way to convey a
visual concept. In this work, we present a method, GAN Sketching, for rewriting
GANs with one or more sketches, to make GANs training easier for novice users.
In particular, we change the weights of an original GAN model according to user
sketches. We encourage the model's output to match the user sketches through a
cross-domain adversarial loss. Furthermore, we explore different regularization
methods to preserve the original model's diversity and image quality.
Experiments have shown that our method can mold GANs to match shapes and poses
specified by sketches while maintaining realism and diversity. Finally, we
demonstrate a few applications of the resulting GAN, including latent space
interpolation and image editing.]]></summary>

drop when deployed in the wild due to domain gaps with training data.
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a promising approach to adapt models
for new domains/environments without any expensive label cost. However, without
ground truth labels, most prior works on UDA for object detection tasks can
only perform coarse image-level and/or feature-level adaptation by using
adversarial learning methods. In this work, we show that such adversarial-based
methods can only reduce the domain style gap, but cannot address the domain
content distribution gap that is shown to be important for object detectors. To
overcome this limitation, we propose the Cross-Domain Semi-Supervised Learning
(CDSSL) framework by leveraging high-quality pseudo labels to learn better
representations from the target domain directly. To enable SSL for cross-domain
object detection, we propose fine-grained domain transfer,
progressive-confidence-based label sharpening and imbalanced sampling strategy
to address two challenges: (i) non-identical distribution between source and
target domain data, (ii) error amplification/accumulation due to noisy pseudo
labeling on the target domain. Experiment results show that our proposed
approach consistently achieves new state-of-the-art performance (2.2% - 9.5%
better than prior best work on mAP) under various domain gap scenarios. The
code will be released.]]></summary>

in the alignment task using SPEECH-COCO captions coupled with MSCOCO images. We
compare the alignment performance using our proposed evaluation metrics to the

perturbations, adversarial examples can also be created by applying a per pixel

examples look more natural to human observers due to absence of additive noise,
they still possess visible distortions caused by spatial transformations. Since
the human vision is more sensitive to the distortions in the luminance compared
to those in chrominance channels, which is one of the main ideas behind the
lossy visual multimedia compression standards, we propose a spatial
transformation based perturbation method to create adversarial examples by only
modifying the color components of an input image. While having competitive
fooling rates on CIFAR-10 and NIPS2017 Adversarial Learning Challenge datasets,
examples created with the proposed method have better scores with regards to

Comparing with previous efforts on object manipulation, our work goes beyond

starts by reconstructing and refining a 3-D mesh representation of the object
of interest from an input image; its control joints are predicted by exploiting
the semantic part segmentation information; the obtained object 3-D mesh is
then rigged \& animated by non-rigid deformation, and rendered to perform
in-situ motions in its original image space. Quantitative evaluations are

for robust active speaker detection (ASD). Traditional methods for ASD usually
operate on each candidate's pre-cropped face track separately and do not
sufficiently consider the relationships among the candidates. This potentially
limits performance, especially in challenging scenarios with low-resolution
faces, multiple candidates, etc. Our solution is a novel, unified framework
that focuses on jointly modeling multiple types of contextual information:
spatial context to indicate the position and scale of each candidate's face,
relational context to capture the visual relationships among the candidates and
contrast audio-visual affinities with each other, and temporal context to
aggregate long-term information and smooth out local uncertainties. Based on
such information, our model optimizes all candidates in a unified process for
robust and reliable ASD. A thorough ablation study is performed on several
challenging ASD benchmarks under different settings. In particular, our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin of about 15% mean Average
Precision (mAP) absolute on two challenging subsets: one with three candidate

achieved prominent performance. However, in real application scenarios, users
always write multiple Chinese characters to form one complete sentence and the
contextual information within these characters holds the significant potential
to improve the accuracy, robustness and efficiency of sentence-level OLHCCR. In
this work, we first propose a simple and straightforward end-to-end network,
namely vanilla compositional network~(VCN) to tackle the sentence-level OLHCCR.
It couples convolutional neural network with sequence modeling architecture to
exploit the handwritten character's previous contextual information. Although
VCN performs much better than the state-of-the-art single OLHCCR model, it
exposes high fragility when confronting with not well written characters such
as sloppy writing, missing or broken strokes. To improve the robustness of
sentence-level OLHCCR, we further propose a novel deep spatial-temporal fusion
network~(DSTFN). It utilizes a pre-trained autoregresssive framework as the
backbone component, which projects each Chinese character into word embeddings,
and integrates the spatial glyph features of handwritten characters and their
contextual information multiple times at multi-layer fusion module. We also
construct a large-scale sentence-level handwriting dataset, named as CSOHD to
evaluate models. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that DSTFN achieves
the state-of-the-art performance, which presents strong robustness compared
with VCN and exiting single OLHCCR models. The in-depth empirical analysis and
case studies indicate that DSTFN can significantly improve the efficiency of
handwriting input, with the handwritten Chinese character with incomplete
strokes being recognized precisely.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Differentiation of colorectal polyps is an important clinical examination. A
computer-aided diagnosis system is required to assist accurate diagnosis from
colonoscopy images. Most previous studies at-tempt to develop models for polyp
differentiation using Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) or other enhanced images.
However, the wide range of these models' applications for clinical work has
been limited by the lagging of imaging techniques. Thus, we propose a novel
framework based on a teacher-student architecture for the accurate colorectal
polyp classification (CPC) through directly using white-light (WL) colonoscopy
images in the examination. In practice, during training, the auxiliary NBI
images are utilized to train a teacher network and guide the student network to
acquire richer feature representation from WL images. The feature transfer is
realized by domain alignment and contrastive learning. Eventually the final
student network has the ability to extract aligned features from only WL images
to facilitate the CPC task. Besides, we release the first public-available
paired CPC dataset containing WL-NBI pairs for the alignment training.
Quantitative and qualitative evaluation indicates that the proposed method
outperforms the previous methods in CPC, improving the accuracy by 5.6%with
very fast speed.]]></summary>

collected railway images is important to maintenance as it can significantly
improve maintenance efficiency and better ensure system safety. Dominant
computer vision-based detection models typically rely on convolutional neural

generate candidate boxes. In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional
transformer network based method to detect multi-class rail components
including the rail, clip, and bolt. We effectively synergize advantages of the
convolutional structure on extracting latent features from raw images as well
as advantages of transformers on selectively determining valuable latent
features to achieve an efficient and accurate performance on rail component
detections. Our proposed method simplifies the detection pipeline by
eliminating the need of prior settings, such as anchor box, aspect ratio,
default coordinates, and post-processing, such as the threshold for non-maximum
suppression; as well as allows users to trade off the quality and complexity of
the detector with limited training data. Results of a comprehensive

tasks involving time sequential data such as speech recognition. However, it is
difficult to deploy these networks on hardware to achieve high throughput and
low latency because the fully-connected structure makes LSTM networks a
memory-bounded algorithm. Previous work in LSTM accelerators either exploited
weight spatial sparsity or temporal sparsity. In this paper, we present a new
accelerator called "Spartus" that exploits spatio-temporal sparsity to achieve
ultra-low latency inference. The spatial sparsity was induced using our
proposed pruning method called Column-Balanced Targeted Dropout (CBTD) that
leads to structured sparse weight matrices benefiting workload balance. It
achieved up to 96% weight sparsity with negligible accuracy difference for an
LSTM network trained on a TIMIT phone recognition task. To induce temporal
sparsity in LSTM, we create the DeltaLSTM by extending the previous DeltaGRU
method to the LSTM network. This combined sparsity saves on weight memory
access and associated arithmetic operations simultaneously. Spartus was
implemented on a Xilinx Zynq-7100 FPGA. The per-sample latency for a single
DeltaLSTM layer of 1024 neurons running on Spartus is 1 us. Spartus achieved
9.4 TOp/s effective batch-1 throughput and 1.1 TOp/J energy efficiency, which
are respectively 4X and 7X higher than the previous state-of-the-art.]]></summary>

contribution to biomedical image analysis applications. With breast cancer
being the common deadliest disease among women, early detection is the key
means to improve survivability. Medical imaging like ultrasound presents an
excellent visual representation of the functioning of the organs; however, for
any radiologist analysing such scans is challenging and time consuming which
delays the diagnosis process. Although various deep learning based approaches
are proposed that achieved promising results, the present article introduces an
efficient residual cross-spatial attention guided inception U-Net (RCA-IUnet)
model with minimal training parameters for tumor segmentation using breast
ultrasound imaging to further improve the segmentation performance of varying
tumor sizes. The RCA-IUnet model follows U-Net topology with residual inception
depth-wise separable convolution and hybrid pooling (max pooling and spectral
pooling) layers. In addition, cross-spatial attention filters are added to
suppress the irrelevant features and focus on the target structure. The
segmentation performance of the proposed model is validated on two publicly

outperformed the other state-of-the-art segmentation models.]]></summary>

Specifically, a parametric similarity function that has a bilinear form is
adopted and a metric learning algorithm is proposed to learn the similarity

``stolen'' by surrogate model attack. There has been significant progress in
solutions to protect the IP of DNN models in classification tasks. However,
little attention has been devoted to the protection of DNNs in image processing
tasks. By utilizing consistent invisible spatial watermarks, one recent work
first considered model watermarking for deep image processing networks and
demonstrated its efficacy in many downstream tasks. Nevertheless, it highly
depends on the hypothesis that the embedded watermarks in the network outputs
are consistent. When the attacker uses some common data augmentation attacks
(e.g., rotate, crop, and resize) during surrogate model training, it will
totally fail because the underlying watermark consistency is destroyed. To
mitigate this issue, we propose a new watermarking methodology, namely
``structure consistency'', based on which a new deep structure-aligned model
watermarking algorithm is designed. Specifically, the embedded watermarks are
designed to be aligned with physically consistent image structures, such as
edges or semantic regions. Experiments demonstrate that our method is much more
robust than the baseline method in resisting data augmentation attacks for
model IP protection. Besides that, we further test the generalization ability
and robustness of our method to a broader range of circumvention attacks.]]></summary>

of attacks, such as adversarial attack, data poisoning attack and backdoor
attack. Among them, backdoor attack is the most cunning one and can occur in
almost every stage of deep learning pipeline. Therefore, backdoor attack has
attracted lots of interests from both academia and industry. However, most
existing backdoor attack methods are either visible or fragile to some
effortless pre-processing such as common data transformations. To address these
limitations, we propose a robust and invisible backdoor attack called ``Poison
Ink''. Concretely, we first leverage the image structures as target poisoning
areas, and fill them with poison ink (information) to generate the trigger
pattern. As the image structure can keep its semantic meaning during the data
transformation, such trigger pattern is inherently robust to data
transformations. Then we leverage a deep injection network to embed such
trigger pattern into the cover image to achieve stealthiness. Compared to
existing popular backdoor attack methods, Poison Ink outperforms both in
stealthiness and robustness. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate
Poison Ink is not only general to different datasets and network architectures,
but also flexible for different attack scenarios. Besides, it also has very
strong resistance against many state-of-the-art defense techniques.]]></summary>

Different from image captioning that describes a static image with details of
almost every object, video captioning usually considers a sequence of frames
and biases towards focused objects, e.g., the objects that stay in focus
regardless of the changing background. Therefore, detecting and properly
accommodating focused objects is critical in video captioning. To enforce the
description of focused objects and achieve controllable video captioning, we
propose an Object-Oriented Non-Autoregressive approach (O2NA), which performs
caption generation in three steps: 1) identify the focused objects and predict
their locations in the target caption; 2) generate the related attribute words
and relation words of these focused objects to form a draft caption; and 3)
combine video information to refine the draft caption to a fluent final
caption. Since the focused objects are generated and located ahead of other
words, it is difficult to apply the word-by-word autoregressive generation
process; instead, we adopt a non-autoregressive approach. The experiments on
two benchmark datasets, i.e., MSR-VTT and MSVD, demonstrate the effectiveness
of O2NA, which achieves results competitive with the state-of-the-arts but with
both higher diversity and higher inference speed.]]></summary>

However, existing methods more or less rely on some assumptions on the signal
and/or degradation model, which limits their practical performance. How to
construct an optimal criterion for unsupervised restoration learning without
any prior knowledge on the degradation model is still an open question. Toward
answering this question, this work proposes a criterion for unsupervised
restoration learning based on the optimal transport theory. This criterion has
favorable properties, e.g., approximately maximal preservation of the
information of the signal, whilst achieving perceptual reconstruction.
Furthermore, though a relaxed unconstrained formulation is used in practical
implementation, we show that the relaxed formulation in theory has the same
solution as the original constrained formulation. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world data, including realistic photographic, microscopy, depth, and raw
depth images, demonstrate that the proposed method even compares favorably with
supervised methods, e.g., approaching the PSNR of supervised methods while
having better perceptual quality. Particularly, for spatially correlated noise
and realistic microscopy images, the proposed method not only achieves better
perceptual quality but also has higher PSNR than supervised methods. Besides,
it shows remarkable superiority in harsh practical conditions with complex

(OSR). Many recent OSR methods rely on auto-encoders to extract class-specific
features by a reconstruction strategy, requiring the network to restore the
input image on pixel-level. This strategy is commonly over-demanding for OSR
since class-specific features are generally contained in target objects, not in
all pixels. To address this shortcoming, here we discard the pixel-level
reconstruction strategy and pay more attention to improving the effectiveness
of class-specific feature extraction. We propose a mutual information-based
method with a streamlined architecture, Maximal Mutual Information Open Set
Recognition (M2IOSR). The proposed M2IOSR only uses an encoder to extract
class-specific features by maximizing the mutual information between the given
input and its latent features across multiple scales. Meanwhile, to further
reduce the open space risk, latent features are constrained to class
conditional Gaussian distributions by a KL-divergence loss function. In this
way, a strong function is learned to prevent the network from mapping different
observations to similar latent features and help the network extract
class-specific features with desired statistical characteristics. The proposed
method significantly improves the performance of baselines and achieves new
state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks consistently. Source codes are

model leveraging a set of binary-labeled datasets. A novel Multi-teacher
Single-student Knowledge Distillation (MS-KD) framework is proposed, where the
teacher models are pre-trained single-organ segmentation networks, and the
student model is a multi-organ segmentation network. Considering that each
teacher focuses on different organs, a region-based supervision method,
consisting of logits-wise supervision and feature-wise supervision, is
proposed. Each teacher supervises the student in two regions, the organ region
where the teacher is considered as an expert and the background region where
all teachers agree. Extensive experiments on three public single-organ datasets
and a multi-organ dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed
MS-KD framework.]]></summary>

theoretically analyze the property of these nonlocal-based blocks, we provide a
new perspective to interpret them, where we view them as a set of graph filters

graph filter, a unified formulation can be derived for explaining and analyzing
the existing nonlocal-based blocks (e.g., nonlocal block, nonlocal stage,
double attention block). Furthermore, by concerning the property of spectral,
we propose an efficient and robust spectral nonlocal block, which can be more
robust and flexible to catch long-range dependencies when inserted into deep
neural networks than the existing nonlocal blocks. Experimental results
demonstrate the clear-cut improvements and practical applicabilities of our

large-scale manually labeled datasets. Especially for fine-grained recognition,
which targets at distinguishing subordinate categories, it will significantly
reduce the labeling costs by leveraging free web data. Despite its significant
practical and research value, the webly supervised fine-grained recognition
problem is not extensively studied in the computer vision community, largely
due to the lack of high-quality datasets. To fill this gap, in this paper we
construct two new benchmark webly supervised fine-grained datasets, termed
WebFG-496 and WebiNat-5089, respectively. In concretely, WebFG-496 consists of
three sub-datasets containing a total of 53,339 web training images with 200
species of birds (Web-bird), 100 types of aircrafts (Web-aircraft), and 196
models of cars (Web-car). For WebiNat-5089, it contains 5089 sub-categories and
more than 1.1 million web training images, which is the largest webly
supervised fine-grained dataset ever. As a minor contribution, we also propose
a novel webly supervised method (termed ``{Peer-learning}'') for benchmarking
these datasets.~Comprehensive experimental results and analyses on two new
benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
performance over the competing baseline models and states-of-the-art. Our

transferring the labeled source domain's knowledge to improve the model's
discriminability on the unlabeled target domain. From a novel perspective, we
argue that the bridging between the source and target domains can be utilized
to tackle the UDA re-ID task, and we focus on explicitly modeling appropriate
intermediate domains to characterize this bridging. Specifically, we propose an
Intermediate Domain Module (IDM) to generate intermediate domains'
representations on-the-fly by mixing the source and target domains' hidden
representations using two domain factors. Based on the "shortest geodesic path"
definition, i.e., the intermediate domains along the shortest geodesic path
between the two extreme domains can play a better bridging role, we propose two
properties that these intermediate domains should satisfy. To ensure these two
properties to better characterize appropriate intermediate domains, we enforce
the bridge losses on intermediate domains' prediction space and feature space,
and enforce a diversity loss on the two domain factors. The bridge losses aim
at guiding the distribution of appropriate intermediate domains to keep the
right distance to the source and target domains. The diversity loss serves as a
regularization to prevent the generated intermediate domains from being
over-fitting to either of the source and target domains. Our proposed method
outperforms the state-of-the-arts by a large margin in all the common UDA re-ID
tasks, and the mAP gain is up to 7.7% on the challenging MSMT17 benchmark. Code

physical simulator using deep reinforcement learning and curriculum learning. A
policy is represented as an attention-based neural network with object-centric

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video abnormal event detection (VAD) is a vital semi-supervised task that
requires learning with only roughly labeled normal videos, as anomalies are
often practically unavailable. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) enable
great progress in VAD, existing solutions typically suffer from two issues: (1)
The precise and comprehensive localization of video events is ignored. (2) The
video semantics and temporal context are under-explored. To address those
issues, we are motivated by the prevalent cloze test in education and propose a
novel approach named visual cloze completion (VCC), which performs VAD by
learning to complete "visual cloze tests" (VCTs). Specifically, VCC first
localizes each video event and encloses it into a spatio-temporal cube (STC).
To achieve both precise and comprehensive localization, appearance and motion
are used as mutually complementary cues to mark the object region associated
with each video event. For each marked region, a normalized patch sequence is
extracted from temporally adjacent frames and stacked into the STC. By
comparing each patch and the patch sequence of a STC to a visual "word" and
"sentence" respectively, we can deliberately erase a certain "word" (patch) to
yield a VCT. DNNs are then trained to infer the erased patch by video
semantics, so as to complete the VCT. To fully exploit the temporal context,
each patch in STC is alternatively erased to create multiple VCTs, and the
erased patch's optical flow is also inferred to integrate richer motion clues.
Meanwhile, a new DNN architecture is designed as a model-level solution to
utilize video semantics and temporal context. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VCC achieves state-of-the-art VAD performance. Our codes and results are
open at \url{https://github.com/yuguangnudt/VEC_VAD/tree/VCC}]]></summary>

Transformer to objects detection and achieves comparable performance with
two-stage object detection frameworks, such as Faster-RCNN. However, DETR
suffers from its slow convergence. Training DETR from scratch needs 500 epochs
to achieve a high accuracy. To accelerate its convergence, we propose a simple
yet effective scheme for improving the DETR framework, namely Spatially
Modulated Co-Attention (SMCA) mechanism. The core idea of SMCA is to conduct
location-aware co-attention in DETR by constraining co-attention responses to
be high near initially estimated bounding box locations. Our proposed SMCA
increases DETR's convergence speed by replacing the original co-attention
mechanism in the decoder while keeping other operations in DETR unchanged.
Furthermore, by integrating multi-head and scale-selection attention designs
into SMCA, our fully-fledged SMCA can achieve better performance compared to
DETR with a dilated convolution-based backbone (45.6 mAP at 108 epochs vs. 43.3
mAP at 500 epochs). We perform extensive ablation studies on COCO dataset to
validate SMCA. Code is released at https://github.com/gaopengcuhk/SMCA-DETR .]]></summary>

is whether the paired low and high resolution images for training accurately
reflect the sampling process of real cameras. Low and high resolution
(LR$\sim$HR) image pairs synthesized by existing degradation models (\eg,
bicubic downsampling) deviate from those in reality; thus the super-resolution
CNN trained by these synthesized LR$\sim$HR image pairs does not perform well
when being applied to real images. In this paper, we propose a novel method to
capture a large set of realistic LR$\sim$HR image pairs using real cameras.The
data acquisition is carried out under controllable lab conditions with minimum
human intervention and at high throughput (about 500 image pairs per hour). The
high level of automation makes it easy to produce a set of real LR$\sim$HR
training image pairs for each camera. Our innovation is to shoot images
displayed on an ultra-high quality screen at different resolutions.There are
three distinctive advantages with our method that allow us to collect
high-quality training datasets for image super-resolution. First, as the LR and
HR images are taken of a 3D planar surface (the screen) the registration
problem fits exactly to a homography model. Second, we can display special
markers on the image margin to further improve the registration
precision.Third, the displayed digital image file can be exploited as a
reference to optimize the high frequency content of the restored image.
Experimental results show that training a super-resolution CNN by our
LR$\sim$HR dataset has superior restoration performance than training it by
existing datasets on real world images at the inference stage.]]></summary>

demonstrated promise in developing objective prognostic models from histology
whole slide images. However, most prognostic models are either based on
histology or genomics alone and do not address how histology and genomics can
be integrated to develop joint image-omic prognostic models. Additionally
identifying explainable morphological and molecular descriptors from these
models that govern such prognosis is of interest. We used multimodal deep
learning to integrate gigapixel whole slide pathology images, RNA-seq
abundance, copy number variation, and mutation data from 5,720 patients across
14 major cancer types. Our interpretable, weakly-supervised, multimodal deep
learning algorithm is able to fuse these heterogeneous modalities for
predicting outcomes and discover prognostic features from these modalities that
corroborate with poor and favorable outcomes via multimodal interpretability.
We compared our model with unimodal deep learning models trained on histology
slides and molecular profiles alone, and demonstrate performance increase in
risk stratification on 9 out of 14 cancers. In addition, we analyze morphologic
and molecular markers responsible for prognostic predictions across all cancer
types. All analyzed data, including morphological and molecular correlates of
patient prognosis across the 14 cancer types at a disease and patient level are
presented in an interactive open-access database
(this http URL) to allow for further exploration and
prognostic biomarker discovery. To validate that these model explanations are
prognostic, we further analyzed high attention morphological regions in WSIs,
which indicates that tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte presence corroborates with
favorable cancer prognosis on 9 out of 14 cancer types studied.]]></summary>

align the visual-textual fragments, like regions in images and words in
sentences, and adopt attention modules to highlight the relevance of
cross-modal semantic correspondences. However, the retrieval performance
remains unsatisfactory due to a lack of consistent representation in both
semantics and structural spaces. In this work, we propose to address the above
issue from two aspects: (i) constructing intrinsic structure (along with
relations) among the fragments of respective modalities, e.g., "dog $\to$ play
$\to$ ball" in semantic structure for an image, and (ii) seeking explicit
inter-modal structural and semantic correspondence between the visual and
textual modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel Structured Multi-modal
Feature Embedding and Alignment (SMFEA) model for image-sentence retrieval. In
order to jointly and explicitly learn the visual-textual embedding and the
cross-modal alignment, SMFEA creates a novel multi-modal structured module with
a shared context-aware referral tree. In particular, the relations of the
visual and textual fragments are modeled by constructing Visual Context-aware
Structured Tree encoder (VCS-Tree) and Textual Context-aware Structured Tree
encoder (TCS-Tree) with shared labels, from which visual and textual features
can be jointly learned and optimized. We utilize the multi-modal tree structure
to explicitly align the heterogeneous image-sentence data by maximizing the
semantic and structural similarity between corresponding inter-modal tree
nodes. Extensive experiments on Microsoft COCO and Flickr30K benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in comparison to the
state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

important for rail transportation safety as it helps prevent potential

unknown categories can appear anytime on railway tracks. In this paper, we
develop a semi-supervised convolutional autoencoder based framework that only
requires railway track images without prior knowledge on the foreign objects in
the training process. It consists of three different modules, a bottleneck
feature generator as encoder, a photographic image generator as decoder, and a
reconstruction discriminator developed via adversarial learning. In the
proposed framework, the problem of detecting the presence, location, and shape
of foreign objects is addressed by comparing the input and reconstructed images
as well as setting thresholds based on reconstruction errors. The proposed

detection task. Thus, it is necessary to focus on more challenging task of
few-shot object detection. It requires the detector to recognize objects of
novel classes with only a few training samples. Nowadays, many existing popular
methods based on meta-learning have achieved promising performance, such as
Meta R-CNN series. However, only a single category of support data is used as
the attention to guide the detecting of query images each time. Their relevance
to each other remains unexploited. Moreover, a lot of recent works treat the
support data and query images as independent branch without considering the
relationship between them. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic
relevance learning model, which utilizes the relationship between all support
images and Region of Interest (RoI) on the query images to construct a dynamic
graph convolutional network (GCN). By adjusting the prediction distribution of
the base detector using the output of this GCN, the proposed model can guide
the detector to improve the class representation implicitly. Comprehensive
experiments have been conducted on Pascal VOC and MS-COCO dataset. The proposed
model achieves the best overall performance, which shows its effectiveness of
learning more generalized features. Our code is available at

machine reading comprehension (MRC) for open-domain question answering (QA).
However, transformers have a high computational cost for inference which makes
them hard to apply to online QA systems for applications like voice assistants.
To reduce computational cost and latency, we propose decoupling the transformer
MRC model into input-component and cross-component. The decoupling allows for
part of the representation computation to be performed offline and cached for
online use. To retain the decoupled transformer accuracy, we devised a
knowledge distillation objective from a standard transformer model. Moreover,
we introduce learned representation compression layers which help reduce by
four times the storage requirement for the cache. In experiments on the SQUAD
2.0 dataset, a decoupled transformer reduces the computational cost and latency
of open-domain MRC by 30-40% with only 1.2 points worse F1-score compared to a

by our observations in logged data on ad image search queries (given ad text),
we formulate a keyword extraction problem, where a keyword extracted from the

context extraction (biased TextRank in particular) by leveraging both the text

category specific biasing with sentence-BERT embeddings. Using data collected
from the Verizon Media Native (Yahoo Gemini) ad platform's stock image search
feature for onboarding advertisers, we demonstrate the superiority of
VisualTextRank compared to competitive keyword extraction baselines (including
an $11\%$ accuracy lift over biased TextRank). For the case when the stock
image library is restricted to English queries, we show the effectiveness of
VisualTextRank on multilingual ads (translated to English) while leveraging

challenging task, whose goal is to identify the 3D object referred by a natural
language sentence from other distractive objects of the same category. Existing
works usually adopt dynamic graph networks to indirectly model the
intra/inter-modal interactions, making the model difficult to distinguish the
referred object from distractors due to the monolithic representations of
visual and linguistic contents. In this work, we exploit Transformer for its
natural suitability on permutation-invariant 3D point clouds data and propose a
TransRefer3D network to extract entity-and-relation aware multimodal context
among objects for more discriminative feature learning. Concretely, we devise
an Entity-aware Attention (EA) module and a Relation-aware Attention (RA)
module to conduct fine-grained cross-modal feature matching. Facilitated by
co-attention operation, our EA module matches visual entity features with
linguistic entity features while RA module matches pair-wise visual relation
features with linguistic relation features, respectively. We further integrate
EA and RA modules into an Entity-and-Relation aware Contextual Block (ERCB) and
stack several ERCBs to form our TransRefer3D for hierarchical multimodal
context modeling. Extensive experiments on both Nr3D and Sr3D datasets
demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing
approaches by up to 10.6% and claims the new state-of-the-art. To the best of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Single online handwritten Chinese character recognition~(single OLHCCR) has
achieved prominent performance. However, in real application scenarios, users
always write multiple Chinese characters to form one complete sentence and the
contextual information within these characters holds the significant potential
to improve the accuracy, robustness and efficiency of sentence-level OLHCCR. In
this work, we first propose a simple and straightforward end-to-end network,
namely vanilla compositional network~(VCN) to tackle the sentence-level OLHCCR.
It couples convolutional neural network with sequence modeling architecture to
exploit the handwritten character's previous contextual information. Although
VCN performs much better than the state-of-the-art single OLHCCR model, it
exposes high fragility when confronting with not well written characters such
as sloppy writing, missing or broken strokes. To improve the robustness of
sentence-level OLHCCR, we further propose a novel deep spatial-temporal fusion
network~(DSTFN). It utilizes a pre-trained autoregresssive framework as the
backbone component, which projects each Chinese character into word embeddings,
and integrates the spatial glyph features of handwritten characters and their
contextual information multiple times at multi-layer fusion module. We also
construct a large-scale sentence-level handwriting dataset, named as CSOHD to
evaluate models. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that DSTFN achieves
the state-of-the-art performance, which presents strong robustness compared
with VCN and exiting single OLHCCR models. The in-depth empirical analysis and
case studies indicate that DSTFN can significantly improve the efficiency of
handwriting input, with the handwritten Chinese character with incomplete
strokes being recognized precisely.]]></summary>

user authentication. However, most existing approaches stored the enrolled gait
pattern insecurely for matching with the validating pattern, thus, posed
critical security and privacy issues. In this study, we present a gait
cryptosystem that generates from gait data the random key for user
authentication, meanwhile, secures the gait pattern. First, we propose a
revocable and random binary string extraction method using a deep neural
network followed by feature-wise binarization. A novel loss function for
network optimization is also designed, to tackle not only the intrauser
stability but also the inter-user randomness. Second, we propose a new
biometric key generation scheme, namely Irreversible Error Correct and
Obfuscate (IECO), improved from the Error Correct and Obfuscate (ECO) scheme,
to securely generate from the binary string the random and irreversible key.
The model was evaluated with two benchmark datasets as OU-ISIR and whuGAIT. We
showed that our model could generate the key of 139 bits from 5-second data
sequence with zero False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR)
smaller than 5.441%. In addition, the security and user privacy analyses showed
that our model was secure against existing attacks on biometric template

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The task of video-based commonsense captioning aims to generate event-wise
captions and meanwhile provide multiple commonsense descriptions (e.g.,
attribute, effect and intention) about the underlying event in the video. Prior
works explore the commonsense captions by using separate networks for different
commonsense types, which is time-consuming and lacks mining the interaction of
different commonsense. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Reasoning Network
(HybridNet) to endow the neural networks with the capability of semantic-level
reasoning and word-level reasoning. Firstly, we develop multi-commonsense
learning for semantic-level reasoning by jointly training different commonsense
types in a unified network, which encourages the interaction between the clues
of multiple commonsense descriptions, event-wise captions and videos. Then,
there are two steps to achieve the word-level reasoning: (1) a memory module
records the history predicted sequence from the previous generation processes;
(2) a memory-routed multi-head attention (MMHA) module updates the word-level
attention maps by incorporating the history information from the memory module
into the transformer decoder for word-level reasoning. Moreover, the multimodal
features are used to make full use of diverse knowledge for commonsense
reasoning. Experiments and abundant analysis on the large-scale
Video-to-Commonsense benchmark show that our HybridNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared with other methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semantic segmentation is a crucial image understanding task, where each pixel
of image is categorized into a corresponding label. Since the pixel-wise
labeling for ground-truth is tedious and labor intensive, in practical
applications, many works exploit the synthetic images to train the model for
real-word image semantic segmentation, i.e., Synthetic-to-Real Semantic
Segmentation (SRSS). However, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained
on the source synthetic data may not generalize well to the target real-world
data. In this work, we propose two simple yet effective texture randomization
mechanisms, Global Texture Randomization (GTR) and Local Texture Randomization
(LTR), for Domain Generalization based SRSS. GTR is proposed to randomize the
texture of source images into diverse unreal texture styles. It aims to
alleviate the reliance of the network on texture while promoting the learning
of the domain-invariant cues. In addition, we find the texture difference is
not always occurred in entire image and may only appear in some local areas.
Therefore, we further propose a LTR mechanism to generate diverse local regions
for partially stylizing the source images. Finally, we implement a
regularization of Consistency between GTR and LTR (CGL) aiming to harmonize the
two proposed mechanisms during training. Extensive experiments on five publicly
available datasets (i.e., GTA5, SYNTHIA, Cityscapes, BDDS and Mapillary) with
various SRSS settings (i.e., GTA5/SYNTHIA to Cityscapes/BDDS/Mapillary)
demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art
methods for domain generalization based SRSS.]]></summary>

a "seesaw" manner, i.e., either sacrifice the head's accuracy for better tail
classification or elevate the head's accuracy even higher but ignore the tail.
Existing algorithms bypass such trade-off by a multi-stage training process:
pre-training on imbalanced set and fine-tuning on balanced set. Though
achieving promising performance, not only are they sensitive to the
generalizability of the pre-trained model, but also not easily integrated into
other computer vision tasks like detection and segmentation, where pre-training
of classifiers solely is not applicable. In this paper, we propose a one-stage
long-tailed recognition scheme, ally complementary experts (ACE), where the
expert is the most knowledgeable specialist in a sub-set that dominates its
training, and is complementary to other experts in the less-seen categories
without being disturbed by what it has never seen. We design a
distribution-adaptive optimizer to adjust the learning pace of each expert to
avoid over-fitting. Without special bells and whistles, the vanilla ACE
outperforms the current one-stage SOTA method by 3-10% on CIFAR10-LT,
CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist datasets. It is also shown to be the
first one to break the "seesaw" trade-off by improving the accuracy of the
majority and minority categories simultaneously in only one stage. Code and

sentiment polarity towards a given aspect mentioned in a review. Despite recent
advances in ASC, enabling machines to preciously infer aspect sentiments is
still challenging. This paper tackles two challenges in ASC: (1) due to lack of
aspect knowledge, aspect representation derived in prior works is inadequate to
represent aspect's exact meaning and property information; (2) prior works only
capture either local syntactic information or global relational information,
thus missing either one of them leads to insufficient syntactic information. To
tackle these challenges, we propose a novel ASC model which not only end-to-end
embeds and leverages aspect knowledge but also marries the two kinds of
syntactic information and lets them compensate for each other. Our model
includes three key components: (1) a knowledge-aware gated recurrent memory
network recurrently integrates dynamically summarized aspect knowledge; (2) a
dual syntax graph network combines both kinds of syntactic information to
comprehensively capture sufficient syntactic information; (3) a knowledge
integrating gate re-enhances the final representation with further needed
aspect knowledge; (4) an aspect-to-context attention mechanism aggregates the
aspect-related semantics from all hidden states into the final representation.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model, which overpass previous state-of-the-art models by
large margins in terms of both Accuracy and Macro-F1.]]></summary>

relationship between objects or instances in a single image, without exploring
the contextual correlation existed among contextual image. In this paper, we
propose Dual Graph Convolutional Networks (Dual-GCN) with transformer and

object-level GCN to capture the object to object spatial relation within a
single image, but also adopt an image-level GCN to capture the feature
information provided by similar images. With the well-designed Dual-GCN, we can
make the linguistic transformer better understand the relationship between
different objects in a single image and make full use of similar images as
auxiliary information to generate a reasonable caption description for a single

difficulty levels, we adopt curriculum learning as the training strategy to
increase the robustness and generalization of our proposed model. We conduct
extensive experiments on the large-scale MS COCO dataset, and the experimental
results powerfully demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms recent

manifests as that the images generated by generators tend to have a high
similarity amongst them, even though their corresponding latent vectors have
been very different. In this paper, we introduce a pluggable block called
diversity penalty (dp) to alleviate mode collapse of GANs. It is used to reduce
the similarity of image pairs in feature space, i.e., if two latent vectors are
different, then we enforce the generator to generate two images with different
features. The normalized Gram Matrix is used to measure the similarity. We
compare the proposed method with Unrolled GAN [17], BourGAN [26], PacGAN [14],
VEEGAN [23] and ALI [4] on 2D synthetic dataset, and results show that our
proposed method can help GAN capture more modes of the data distribution.
Further, we apply this penalty term into image data augmentation on MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10, and the testing accuracy is improved by 0.24%,
1.34% and 0.52% compared with WGAN GP [6], respectively. Finally, we
quantitatively evaluate the proposed method with IS and FID on CelebA,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we propose a novel hand-based person recognition method for
the purpose of criminal investigations since the hand image is often the only
available information in cases of serious crime such as sexual abuse. Our
proposed method, Multi-Branch with Attention Network (MBA-Net), incorporates
both channel and spatial attention modules in branches in addition to a global
(without attention) branch to capture global structural information for
discriminative feature learning. The attention modules focus on the relevant
features of the hand image while suppressing the irrelevant backgrounds. In
order to overcome the weakness of the attention mechanisms, equivariant to
pixel shuffling, we integrate relative positional encodings into the spatial
attention module to capture the spatial positions of pixels. Extensive
evaluations on two large multi-ethnic and publicly available hand datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
surpassing the existing hand-based identification methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fourier single-pixel imaging (FSI) is a branch of single-pixel imaging
techniques. It uses Fourier basis patterns as structured patterns for spatial
information acquisition in the Fourier domain. However, the spatial resolution
of the image reconstructed by FSI mainly depends on the number of Fourier
coefficients sampled. The reconstruction of a high-resolution image typically
requires a number of Fourier coefficients to be sampled, and therefore takes a
long data acquisition time. Here we propose a new sampling strategy for FSI. It
allows FSI to reconstruct a clear and sharp image with a reduced number of
measurements. The core of the proposed sampling strategy is to perform a
variable density sampling in the Fourier space and, more importantly, the
density with respect to the importance of Fourier coefficients is subject to a
one-dimensional Gaussian function. Combined with compressive sensing, the
proposed sampling strategy enables better reconstruction quality than
conventional sampling strategies, especially when the sampling ratio is low. We
experimentally demonstrate compressive FSI combined with the proposed sampling
strategy is able to reconstruct a sharp and clear image of 256-by-256 pixels
with a sampling ratio of 10%. The proposed method enables fast single-pixel
imaging and provides a new approach for efficient spatial information
acquisition.]]></summary>

invasive surgery. It is believed that image-based navigation will increase the
access to reproducible, safe, and high-precision surgery as it may then be
performed at acceptable costs and effort. This is because image-based
techniques avoid the need of specialized equipment and seamlessly integrate
with contemporary workflows. Further, it is expected that image-based
navigation will play a major role in enabling mixed reality environments and
autonomous, robotic workflows. A critical component of image guidance is 2D/3D
registration, a technique to estimate the spatial relationships between 3D
structures, e.g., volumetric imagery or tool models, and 2D images thereof,
such as fluoroscopy or endoscopy. While image-based 2D/3D registration is a
mature technique, its transition from the bench to the bedside has been
restrained by well-known challenges, including brittleness of the optimization
objective, hyperparameter selection, and initialization, difficulties around
inconsistencies or multiple objects, and limited single-view performance. One
reason these challenges persist today is that analytical solutions are likely
inadequate considering the complexity, variability, and high-dimensionality of
generic 2D/3D registration problems. The recent advent of machine
learning-based approaches to imaging problems that, rather than specifying the
desired functional mapping, approximate it using highly expressive parametric
models holds promise for solving some of the notorious challenges in 2D/3D
registration. In this manuscript, we review the impact of machine learning on
2D/3D registration to systematically summarize the recent advances made by
introduction of this novel technology. Grounded in these insights, we then
offer our perspective on the most pressing needs, significant open problems,
and possible next steps.]]></summary>

translation (ST) has long been treated as an independent task, failing to fully
draw strength from the rapid advances of its sibling - text machine translation
(MT). With text and audio inputs represented differently, the modality gap has
rendered MT data and its end-to-end models incompatible with their ST
counterparts. In observation of this obstacle, we propose to bridge this
representation gap with Chimera. By projecting audio and text features to a
common semantic representation, Chimera unifies MT and ST tasks and boosts the
performance on ST benchmarks, MuST-C and Augmented Librispeech, to a new
state-of-the-art. Specifically, Chimera obtains 27.1 BLEU on MuST-C EN-DE,
improving the SOTA by a +1.9 BLEU margin. Further experimental analyses
demonstrate that the shared semantic space indeed conveys common knowledge
between these two tasks and thus paves a new way for augmenting training
resources across modalities. Code, data, and resources are available at

advancing the understanding of tumor progression, tumor micro-environment, and
their underpinning biological processes. So far, these approaches have focused
on extracting information associated with annotations. In this work, we ask how
much information can be learned from the tissue architecture itself.

We present an adversarial learning model to extract feature representations
of cancer tissue, without the need for manual annotations. We show that these
representations are able to identify a variety of morphological characteristics
across three cancer types: Breast, colon, and lung. This is supported by 1) the
separation of morphologic characteristics in the latent space; 2) the ability
to classify tissue type with logistic regression using latent representations,
with an AUC of 0.97 and 85% accuracy, comparable to supervised deep models; 3)
the ability to predict the presence of tumor in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) using
multiple instance learning (MIL), achieving an AUC of 0.98 and 94% accuracy.

Our results show that our model captures distinct phenotypic characteristics
of real tissue samples, paving the way for further understanding of tumor
progression and tumor micro-environment, and ultimately refining
histopathological classification for diagnosis and treatment. The code and
pretrained models are available at:

synthesis (SVS) system. In recent years, DNNs have been utilized in statistical
parametric SVS systems, and DNN-based SVS systems have demonstrated better
performance than conventional hidden Markov model-based ones. SVS systems are
required to synthesize a singing voice with pitch and timing that strictly
follow a given musical score. Additionally, singing expressions that are not
described on the musical score, such as vibrato and timing fluctuations, should
be reproduced. The proposed system is composed of four modules: a time-lag
model, a duration model, an acoustic model, and a vocoder, and singing voices
can be synthesized taking these characteristics of singing voices into account.
To better model a singing voice, the proposed system incorporates improved
approaches to modeling pitch and vibrato and better training criteria into the
acoustic model. In addition, we incorporated PeriodNet, a non-autoregressive
neural vocoder with robustness for the pitch, into our systems to generate a
high-fidelity singing voice waveform. Moreover, we propose automatic pitch
correction techniques for DNN-based SVS to synthesize singing voices with
correct pitch even if the training data has out-of-tune phrases. Experimental
results show our system can synthesize a singing voice with better timing, more
natural vibrato, and correct pitch, and it can achieve better mean opinion
scores in subjective evaluation tests.]]></summary>

detection and coreference resolution. However, existing works on coreference
resolution are mainly dependent on filtered mention representation, while other
spans are largely neglected. In this paper, we aim at increasing the
utilization rate of data and investigating whether those eliminated spans are
totally useless, or to what extent they can improve the performance of
coreference resolution. To achieve this, we propose a mention representation
refining strategy where spans highly related to mentions are well leveraged
using a pointer network for representation enhancing. Notably, we utilize an
additional loss term in this work to encourage the diversity between entity
clusters. Experimental results on the document-level CoNLL-2012 Shared Task
English dataset show that eliminated spans are indeed much effective and our
approach can achieve competitive results when compared with previous
state-of-the-art in coreference resolution.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce a new efficient framework, the Unified Context Network (UniCon),
for robust active speaker detection (ASD). Traditional methods for ASD usually
operate on each candidate's pre-cropped face track separately and do not
sufficiently consider the relationships among the candidates. This potentially
limits performance, especially in challenging scenarios with low-resolution
faces, multiple candidates, etc. Our solution is a novel, unified framework
that focuses on jointly modeling multiple types of contextual information:
spatial context to indicate the position and scale of each candidate's face,
relational context to capture the visual relationships among the candidates and
contrast audio-visual affinities with each other, and temporal context to
aggregate long-term information and smooth out local uncertainties. Based on
such information, our model optimizes all candidates in a unified process for
robust and reliable ASD. A thorough ablation study is performed on several
challenging ASD benchmarks under different settings. In particular, our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin of about 15% mean Average
Precision (mAP) absolute on two challenging subsets: one with three candidate
speakers, and the other with faces smaller than 64 pixels. Together, our UniCon
achieves 92.0% mAP on the AVA-ActiveSpeaker validation set, surpassing 90% for
the first time on this challenging dataset at the time of submission. Project

compared to the conventional pipeline approach using automatic speech
recognition (ASR), followed by natural language processing modules. It attempts
to predict intent from speech without using an intermediate ASR module.
However, such end-to-end framework suffers from the unavailability of large
speech resources with higher acoustic variation in spoken language
understanding. In this work, we exploit the scope of the transformer
distillation method that is specifically designed for knowledge distillation
from a transformer based language model to a transformer based speech model. In
this regard, we leverage the reliable and widely used bidirectional encoder
representations from transformers (BERT) model as a language model and transfer
the knowledge to build an acoustic model for intent classification using the
speech. In particular, a multilevel transformer based teacher-student model is
designed, and knowledge distillation is performed across attention and hidden
sub-layers of different transformer layers of the student and teacher models.
We achieve an intent classification accuracy of 99.10% and 88.79% for Fluent
speech corpus and ATIS database, respectively. Further, the proposed method
demonstrates better performance and robustness in acoustically degraded
condition compared to the baseline method.]]></summary>

realism reached by recent fake-generating technologies, threatens to impair the
trustworthiness of online information sources. The process of uploading and
sharing data tends to hinder standard media forensic analyses, since multiple
re-sharing steps progressively hide the traces of past manipulations. At the
same time though, new traces are introduced by the platforms themselves,
enabling the reconstruction of the sharing history of digital objects, with
possible applications in information flow monitoring and source identification.
In this work, we propose a supervised framework for the reconstruction of image
sharing chains on social media platforms. The system is structured as a cascade
of backtracking blocks, each of them tracing back one step of the sharing chain
at a time. Blocks are designed as ensembles of classifiers trained to analyse
the input image independently from one another by leveraging different feature
representations that describe both content and container of the media object.
Individual decisions are then properly combined by a late fusion strategy.
Results highlight the advantages of employing multiple clues, which allow
accurately tracing back up to three steps along the sharing chain.]]></summary>

(ALT) research. Our main contribution is a novel variant of the Multistreaming
Time-Delay Neural Network (MTDNN) architecture, called MSTRE-Net, which
processes the temporal information using multiple streams in parallel with
varying resolutions keeping the network more compact, and thus with a faster
inference and an improved recognition rate than having identical TDNN streams.
In addition, two novel preprocessing steps prior to training the acoustic model
are proposed. First, we suggest using recordings from both monophonic and
polyphonic domains during training the acoustic model. Second, we tag
monophonic and polyphonic recordings with distinct labels for discriminating
non-vocal silence and music instances during alignment. Moreover, we present a
new test set with a considerably larger size and a higher musical variability
compared to the existing datasets used in ALT literature, while maintaining the
gender balance of the singers. Our best performing model sets the
state-of-the-art in lyrics transcription by a large margin. For

reality in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. However, vaccine hesitancy,
fueled by exposure to social media misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines
became a major hurdle. Therefore, it is essential to automatically detect where
misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on social media is spread and what kind
of misinformation is discussed, such that inoculation interventions can be
delivered at the right time and in the right place, in addition to
interventions designed to address vaccine hesitancy. This paper is addressing
the first step in tackling hesitancy against COVID-19 vaccines, namely the
automatic detection of misinformation about the vaccines on Twitter, the social
media platform that has the highest volume of conversations about COVID-19 and
its vaccines. We present CoVaxLies, a new dataset of tweets judged relevant to
several misinformation targets about COVID-19 vaccines on which a novel method
of detecting misinformation was developed. Our method organizes CoVaxLies in a
Misinformation Knowledge Graph as it casts misinformation detection as a graph
link prediction problem. The misinformation detection method detailed in this
paper takes advantage of the link scoring functions provided by several
knowledge embedding methods. The experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of this method when compared with classification-based methods,
widely used currently.]]></summary>

compare the alignment performance using our proposed evaluation metrics to the

captions and meanwhile provide multiple commonsense descriptions (e.g.,
attribute, effect and intention) about the underlying event in the video. Prior
works explore the commonsense captions by using separate networks for different
commonsense types, which is time-consuming and lacks mining the interaction of
different commonsense. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Reasoning Network
(HybridNet) to endow the neural networks with the capability of semantic-level
reasoning and word-level reasoning. Firstly, we develop multi-commonsense
learning for semantic-level reasoning by jointly training different commonsense
types in a unified network, which encourages the interaction between the clues
of multiple commonsense descriptions, event-wise captions and videos. Then,
there are two steps to achieve the word-level reasoning: (1) a memory module
records the history predicted sequence from the previous generation processes;
(2) a memory-routed multi-head attention (MMHA) module updates the word-level
attention maps by incorporating the history information from the memory module
into the transformer decoder for word-level reasoning. Moreover, the multimodal
features are used to make full use of diverse knowledge for commonsense
reasoning. Experiments and abundant analysis on the large-scale
Video-to-Commonsense benchmark show that our HybridNet achieves

information history. Researchers have been paying attention to improvement of
algorithmic performance such as MAE and precision@K. Major techniques such as
matrix factorization and learning to rank are optimized based on such
evaluation metrics. However, the intrinsic Matthew Effect problem poses great
threat to the fairness of the recommender system, and the unfairness problem
cannot be resolved by optimization of traditional metrics. In this paper, we
propose a novel algorithm that incorporates Matthew Effect reduction with the

tremendous strides, but it still heavily relies on fixed datasets in stationary
environments. Continual learning is a growing field of research that examines
how AI systems can learn sequentially from a continuous stream of linked data
in the same way that biological systems do. Simultaneously, fake media such as
deepfakes and synthetic face images have emerged as significant to current
multimedia technologies. Recently, numerous method has been proposed which can
detect deepfakes with high accuracy. However, they suffer significantly due to
their reliance on fixed datasets in limited evaluation settings. Therefore, in
this work, we apply continuous learning to neural networks' learning dynamics,
emphasizing its potential to increase data efficiency significantly. We propose
Continual Representation using Distillation (CoReD) method that employs the
concept of Continual Learning (CL), Representation Learning (RL), and Knowledge
Distillation (KD). We design CoReD to perform sequential domain adaptation
tasks on new deepfake and GAN-generated synthetic face datasets, while
effectively minimizing the catastrophic forgetting in a teacher-student model
setting. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method is
efficient at domain adaptation to detect low-quality deepfakes videos and
GAN-generated images from several datasets, outperforming the-state-of-art
baseline methods.]]></summary>

needs of multiple application scenarios. The design and assessment of point
cloud coding methods require reliable objective quality metrics to evaluate the
level of degradation introduced by compression or any other type of processing.
Several point cloud objective quality metrics has been recently proposed to
reliable estimate human perceived quality, including the so-called
projection-based metrics. In this context, this paper proposes a joint geometry
and color projection-based point cloud objective quality metric which solves
the critical weakness of this type of quality metrics, i.e., the misalignment
between the reference and degraded projected images. Moreover, the proposed
point cloud quality metric exploits the best performing 2D quality metrics in
the literature to assess the quality of the projected images. The experimental
results show that the proposed projection-based quality metric offers the best
subjective-objective correlation performance in comparison with other metrics
in the literature. The Pearson correlation gains regarding D1-PSNR and D2-PSNR
metrics are 17% and 14.2 when data with all coding degradations is considered.]]></summary>

like BERT has become a dominating approach for most NLP tasks. Simply
fine-tuning those large language models on downstream tasks or combining it
with task-specific pretraining is often not robust. In particular, the
performance considerably varies as the random seed changes or the number of
pretraining and/or fine-tuning iterations varies, and the fine-tuned model is
vulnerable to adversarial attack. We propose a simple yet effective
adapter-based approach to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we insert small
bottleneck layers (i.e., adapter) within each layer of a pretrained model, then
fix the pretrained layers and train the adapter layers on the downstream task
data, with (1) task-specific unsupervised pretraining and then (2)
task-specific supervised training (e.g., classification, sequence labeling).
Our experiments demonstrate that such a training scheme leads to improved
stability and adversarial robustness in transfer learning to various downstream
tasks.]]></summary>

Different from image captioning that describes a static image with details of
almost every object, video captioning usually considers a sequence of frames
and biases towards focused objects, e.g., the objects that stay in focus
regardless of the changing background. Therefore, detecting and properly
accommodating focused objects is critical in video captioning. To enforce the
description of focused objects and achieve controllable video captioning, we
propose an Object-Oriented Non-Autoregressive approach (O2NA), which performs
caption generation in three steps: 1) identify the focused objects and predict
their locations in the target caption; 2) generate the related attribute words
and relation words of these focused objects to form a draft caption; and 3)
combine video information to refine the draft caption to a fluent final
caption. Since the focused objects are generated and located ahead of other
words, it is difficult to apply the word-by-word autoregressive generation
process; instead, we adopt a non-autoregressive approach. The experiments on
two benchmark datasets, i.e., MSR-VTT and MSVD, demonstrate the effectiveness
of O2NA, which achieves results competitive with the state-of-the-arts but with
both higher diversity and higher inference speed.]]></summary>

use case even though our approach is trivially adaptable for other domains.
Moreover, our system is model-agnostic (for both recommender systems and
critiquing models) allowing a great flexibility and further extensions. Our
interfaces are above all a useful tool to help research in recommendation with
critiquing. They allow to test such systems on a real use case and also to

monophonic and polyphonic recordings with distinct labels for discriminating
non-vocal silence and music instances during alignment. Moreover, we present a
new test set with a considerably larger size and a higher musical variability

been the most important technology for increasing the business at Fliggy, one
of the most popular online travel platforms (OTPs) in China. There are three
major challenges facing OTPs: sparsity, diversity, and implicitness. In this
paper, we present a novel Fliggy ITinerary-aware deep matching NETwork (FitNET)
to address these three challenges. FitNET is designed based on the popular deep
matching network, which has been successfully employed in many industrial
recommendation systems, due to its effectiveness. The concept itinerary is
firstly proposed under the context of recommendation systems for OTPs, which is
defined as the list of unconsumed orders of a user. All orders in a user
itinerary are learned as a whole, based on which the implicit travel intention
of each user can be more accurately inferred. To alleviate the sparsity
problem, users' profiles are incorporated into FitNET. Meanwhile, a series of
itinerary-aware attention mechanisms that capture the vital interactions
between user's itinerary and other input categories are carefully designed.
These mechanisms are very helpful in inferring a user's travel intention or
preference, and handling the diversity in a user's need. Further, two training
objectives, i.e., prediction accuracy of user's travel intention and prediction
accuracy of user's click behavior, are utilized by FitNET, so that these two
objectives can be optimized simultaneously. An offline experiment on Fliggy
production dataset with over 0.27 million users and 1.55 million travel items,
and an online A/B test both show that FitNET effectively learns users' travel
intentions, preferences, and diverse needs, based on their itineraries and
gains superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. FitNET now
has been successfully deployed at Fliggy, serving major online traffic.]]></summary>

2-dimensional signals (e.g., NLP and Image Content Understanding). As a
potential alternative to convolutional neural networks, it shares merits of
strong interpretability, high discriminative power on hyper-scale data, and
flexibility in processing varying length inputs. However, its encoders
naturally contain computational intensive operations such as pair-wise
self-attention, incurring heavy computational burden when being applied on the
complex 3-dimensional video signals.

This paper presents Token Shift Module (i.e., TokShift), a novel,
zero-parameter, zero-FLOPs operator, for modeling temporal relations within
each transformer encoder. Specifically, the TokShift barely temporally shifts
partial [Class] token features back-and-forth across adjacent frames. Then, we
densely plug the module into each encoder of a plain 2D vision transformer for
learning 3D video representation. It is worth noticing that our TokShift
transformer is a pure convolutional-free video transformer pilot with
computational efficiency for video understanding. Experiments on standard
benchmarks verify its robustness, effectiveness, and efficiency. Particularly,
with input clips of 8/12 frames, the TokShift transformer achieves SOTA
precision: 79.83%/80.40% on the Kinetics-400, 66.56% on EGTEA-Gaze+, and 96.80%
on UCF-101 datasets, comparable or better than existing SOTA convolutional
counterparts. Our code is open-sourced in:

to predict user' preference. However, it is difficult to recommend items to new
users accurately. To alleviate this problem, existing user cold start methods
either apply deep learning to build a cross-domain recommender system or map
user attributes into the space of user behaviour. These methods are more
challenging when applied to online travel platform (e.g., Fliggy), because it
is hard to find a cross-domain that user has similar behaviour with travel
scenarios and the Location Based Services (LBS) information of users have not
been paid sufficient attention. In this work, we propose a LBS-based
Heterogeneous Relations Model (LHRM) for user cold start recommendation, which
utilizes user's LBS information and behaviour information in related domains
and user's behaviour information in travel platforms (e.g., Fliggy) to
construct the heterogeneous relations between users and items. Moreover, an
attention-based multi-layer perceptron is applied to extract latent factors of
users and items. Through this way, LHRM has better generalization performance
than existing methods. Experimental results on real data from Fliggy's offline
log illustrate the effectiveness of LHRM.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent research on cross-lingual word embeddings has been dominated by
unsupervised mapping approaches that align monolingual embeddings. Such methods
critically rely on those embeddings having a similar structure, but it was
recently shown that the separate training in different languages causes
departures from this assumption. In this paper, we propose an alternative
approach that does not have this limitation, while requiring a weak seed
dictionary (e.g., a list of identical words) as the only form of supervision.
Rather than aligning two fixed embedding spaces, our method works by fixing the
target language embeddings, and learning a new set of embeddings for the source
language that are aligned with them. To that end, we use an extension of
skip-gram that leverages translated context words as anchor points, and
incorporates self-learning and iterative restarts to reduce the dependency on
the initial dictionary. Our approach outperforms conventional mapping methods
on bilingual lexicon induction, and obtains competitive results in the
downstream XNLI task.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Jeffreys divergence is a renown symmetrization of the statistical
Kullback-Leibler divergence which is often used in statistics, machine
learning, signal processing, and information sciences in general. Since the
Jeffreys divergence between the ubiquitous Gaussian Mixture Models are not
available in closed-form, many techniques with various pros and cons have been
proposed in the literature to either (i) estimate, (ii) approximate, or (iii)
lower and/or upper bound this divergence. In this work, we propose a simple yet
fast heuristic to approximate the Jeffreys divergence between two univariate
GMMs of arbitrary number of components. The heuristic relies on converting GMMs
into pairs of dually parameterized probability densities belonging to
exponential families. In particular, we consider Exponential-Polynomial
Densities, and design a goodness-of-fit criterion to measure the dissimilarity
between a GMM and a EPD which is a generalization of the Hyv\"arinen
divergence. This criterion allows one to select the orders of the EPDs to
approximate the GMMs. We demonstrate experimentally that the computational time
of our heuristic improves over the stochastic Monte Carlo estimation baseline
by several orders of magnitude while approximating reasonably well the Jeffreys
divergence, specially when the univariate mixtures have a small number of
modes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One widely used approach towards understanding the inner workings of deep
convolutional neural networks is to visualize unit responses via activation
maximization. Feature visualizations via activation maximization are thought to
provide humans with precise information about the image features that cause a
unit to be activated. If this is indeed true, these synthetic images should
enable humans to predict the effect of an intervention, such as whether
occluding a certain patch of the image (say, a dog's head) changes a unit's
activation. Here, we test this hypothesis by asking humans to predict which of
two square occlusions causes a larger change to a unit's activation. Both a
large-scale crowdsourced experiment and measurements with experts show that on
average, the extremely activating feature visualizations by Olah et al. (2017)
indeed help humans on this task ($67 \pm 4\%$ accuracy; baseline performance
without any visualizations is $60 \pm 3\%$). However, they do not provide any
significant advantage over other visualizations (such as e.g. dataset samples),
which yield similar performance ($66 \pm 3\%$ to $67 \pm 3\%$ accuracy). Taken
together, we propose an objective psychophysical task to quantify the benefit
of unit-level interpretability methods for humans, and find no evidence that
feature visualizations provide humans with better "causal understanding" than
simple alternative visualizations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Randomized smoothing (RS) is an effective and scalable technique for
constructing neural network classifiers that are certifiably robust to
adversarial perturbations. Most RS works focus on training a good base model
that boosts the certified robustness of the smoothed model. However, existing
RS techniques treat every data point the same, i.e., the variance of the
Gaussian noise used to form the smoothed model is preset and universal for all
training and test data. This preset and universal Gaussian noise variance is
suboptimal since different data points have different margins and the local
properties of the base model vary across the input examples. In this paper, we
examine the impact of customized handling of examples and propose Instance-wise
Randomized Smoothing (Insta-RS) -- a multiple-start search algorithm that
assigns customized Gaussian variances to test examples. We also design Insta-RS
Train -- a novel two-stage training algorithm that adaptively adjusts and
customizes the noise level of each training example for training a base model
that boosts the certified robustness of the instance-wise Gaussian smoothed
model. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, we show that our
method significantly enhances the average certified radius (ACR) as well as the
clean data accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art provably robust

recommendations in domains with limited knowledge about user preferences. We
expand the variational autoencoder collaborative filtering from a single-domain
to a multi-domain setting. The intuition is that user-item interactions in a
source domain can augment the recommendation quality in a target domain. The
intuition can be taken to its extreme, where, in a cross-domain setup, the user
history in a source domain is enough to generate high-quality recommendations
in a target one. We thus create a Product-of-Experts (POE) architecture for
recommendations that jointly models user-item interactions across multiple
domains. The method is resilient to missing data for one or more of the
domains, which is a situation often found in real life. We present results on
two widely-used datasets - Amazon and Yelp, which support the claim that
holistic user preference knowledge leads to better recommendations.
Surprisingly, we find that in some cases, a POE recommender that does not
access the target domain user representation can surpass a strong VAE
recommender baseline trained on the target domain.]]></summary>

patterns in binary data. In this paper we consider the rank-k binary matrix
factorisation problem (k-BMF) under Boolean arithmetic: we are given an n x m
binary matrix X with possibly missing entries and need to find two binary
matrices A and B of dimension n x k and k x m respectively, which minimise the
distance between X and the Boolean product of A and B in the squared Frobenius
distance. We present a compact and two exponential size integer programs (IPs)
for k-BMF and show that the compact IP has a weak LP relaxation, while the
exponential size IPs have a stronger equivalent LP relaxation. We introduce a
new objective function, which differs from the traditional squared Frobenius
objective in attributing a weight to zero entries of the input matrix that is
proportional to the number of times the zero is erroneously covered in a rank-k
factorisation. For one of the exponential size IPs we describe a computational
approach based on column generation. Experimental results on synthetic and real
word datasets suggest that our integer programming approach is competitive
against available methods for k-BMF and provides accurate low-error
factorisations.]]></summary>

sera of cancer patients are enriched with heterogeneous secretory lipid bound
extracellular vesicles (EVs), which present a complex repertoire of information
and biomarkers, representing their cell of origin, that are being currently
studied in the field of liquid biopsy and cancer screening. Vibrational
spectroscopies provide non-invasive approaches for the assessment of structural
and biophysical properties in complex biological samples. In this study,
multiple Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed on the EVs extracted
from the blood sera of 9 patients consisting of four different cancer subtypes
(colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer and pancreatic
cancer) and five healthy patients (controls). FTIR(Fourier Transform Infrared)
spectroscopy measurements were performed as a complementary approach to Raman
analysis, on two of the four cancer subtypes.

The AdaBoost Random Forest Classifier, Decision Trees, and Support Vector
Machines (SVM) distinguished the baseline corrected Raman spectra of cancer EVs
from those of healthy controls (18 spectra) with a classification accuracy of
greater than 90% when reduced to a spectral frequency range of 1800 to 1940
inverse cm, and subjected to a 0.5 training/testing split. FTIR classification
accuracy on 14 spectra showed an 80% classification accuracy. Our findings
demonstrate that basic machine learning algorithms are powerful tools to
distinguish the complex vibrational spectra of cancer patient EVs from those of
healthy patients. These experimental methods hold promise as valid and
efficient liquid biopsy for machine intelligence-assisted early cancer
screening.]]></summary>

vision and graphics. The required smoothing properties can be different or even
contradictive among different tasks. Nevertheless, the inherent smoothing
nature of one smoothing operator is usually fixed and thus cannot meet the
various requirements of different applications. In this paper, we first
introduce the truncated Huber penalty function which shows strong flexibility
under different parameter settings. A generalized framework is then proposed
with the introduced truncated Huber penalty function. When combined with its
strong flexibility, our framework is able to achieve diverse smoothing natures
where contradictive smoothing behaviors can even be achieved. It can also yield
the smoothing behavior that can seldom be achieved by previous methods, and
superior performance is thus achieved in challenging cases. These together
enable our framework capable of a range of applications and able to outperform
the state-of-the-art approaches in several tasks, such as image detail
enhancement, clip-art compression artifacts removal, guided depth map
restoration, image texture removal, etc. In addition, an efficient numerical
solution is provided and its convergence is theoretically guaranteed even the
optimization framework is non-convex and non-smooth. A simple yet effective
approach is further proposed to reduce the computational cost of our method
while maintaining its performance. The effectiveness and superior performance
of our approach are validated through comprehensive experiments in a range of
applications. Our code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context: Machine Learning (ML) has been at the heart of many innovations over
the past years. However, including it in so-called 'safety-critical' systems
such as automotive or aeronautic has proven to be very challenging, since the
shift in paradigm that ML brings completely changes traditional certification
approaches.

Objective: This paper aims to elucidate challenges related to the
certification of ML-based safety-critical systems, as well as the solutions
that are proposed in the literature to tackle them, answering the question 'How
to Certify Machine Learning Based Safety-critical Systems?'.

Method: We conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of research papers
published between 2015 to 2020, covering topics related to the certification of
ML systems. In total, we identified 217 papers covering topics considered to be
the main pillars of ML certification: Robustness, Uncertainty, Explainability,
Verification, Safe Reinforcement Learning, and Direct Certification. We
analyzed the main trends and problems of each sub-field and provided summaries
of the papers extracted.

Results: The SLR results highlighted the enthusiasm of the community for this
subject, as well as the lack of diversity in terms of datasets and type of
models. It also emphasized the need to further develop connections between
academia and industries to deepen the domain study. Finally, it also
illustrated the necessity to build connections between the above mention main
pillars that are for now mainly studied separately.

Conclusion: We highlighted current efforts deployed to enable the
certification of ML based software systems, and discuss some future research
directions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A key feature of sequential decision making under uncertainty is a need to
balance between exploiting--choosing the best action according to the current
knowledge, and exploring--obtaining information about values of other actions.
The multi-armed bandit problem, a classical task that captures this trade-off,
served as a vehicle in machine learning for developing bandit algorithms that
proved to be useful in numerous industrial applications. The active inference
framework, an approach to sequential decision making recently developed in
neuroscience for understanding human and animal behaviour, is distinguished by
its sophisticated strategy for resolving the exploration-exploitation
trade-off. This makes active inference an exciting alternative to already
established bandit algorithms. Here we derive an efficient and scalable
approximate active inference algorithm and compare it to two state-of-the-art
bandit algorithms: Bayesian upper confidence bound and optimistic Thompson
sampling. This comparison is done on two types of bandit problems: a stationary
and a dynamic switching bandit. Our empirical evaluation shows that the active
inference algorithm does not produce efficient long-term behaviour in
stationary bandits. However, in the more challenging switching bandit problem
active inference performs substantially better than the two state-of-the-art
bandit algorithms. The results open exciting venues for further research in
theoretical and applied machine learning, as well as lend additional
credibility to active inference as a general framework for studying human and
animal behaviour.]]></summary>

observation, canopy scale data are suitable for this purpose. To test the
potentialities of the second approach, we equipped the trees at two measurement
sites with sap flow sensors in spruce forests. The sites have contrasting
topography. The measurement period covered the months between June 2020 and
January 2021. To link plot scale transpiration with earth observations, we
utilized Sentinel-2 and local meteorological data. Within a machine learning
framework, we have tested the suitability of earth observations for modelling
canopy transpiration. The R2 of the cross-validated trained models at the
measurement sites was between 0.57 and 0.80. These results demonstrate the
relevance of Sentinel-2 data for the data-driven upscaling of ecosystem fluxes
from plot scale sap flow data. If applied to a broader network of sites and

data preparation steps, such as string-transformations and table-manipulation
operators (e.g., Join, GroupBy, Pivot, etc.). We in this work propose to
automate multiple such steps end-to-end, by synthesizing complex data pipelines
with both string transformations and table-manipulation operators. We propose a
novel "by-target" paradigm that allows users to easily specify the desired
pipeline, which is a significant departure from the traditional by-example
paradigm. Using by-target, users would provide input tables (e.g., csv or json
files), and point us to a "target table" (e.g., an existing database table or
BI dashboard) to demonstrate how the output from the desired pipeline would
schematically "look like". While the problem is seemingly underspecified, our
unique insight is that implicit table constraints such as FDs and keys can be
exploited to significantly constrain the space to make the problem tractable.
We develop an Auto-Pipeline system that learns to synthesize pipelines using
reinforcement learning and search. Experiments on large numbers of real
pipelines crawled from GitHub suggest that Auto-Pipeline can successfully
synthesize 60-70% of these complex pipelines with up to 10 steps.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assessing an AI agent that can converse in human language and understand
visual content is challenging. Generation metrics, such as BLEU scores favor
correct syntax over semantics. Hence a discriminative approach is often used,
where an agent ranks a set of candidate options. The mean reciprocal rank (MRR)
metric evaluates the model performance by taking into account the rank of a
single human-derived answer. This approach, however, raises a new challenge:
the ambiguity and synonymy of answers, for instance, semantic equivalence
(e.g., `yeah' and `yes'). To address this, the normalized discounted cumulative
gain (NDCG) metric has been used to capture the relevance of all the correct
answers via dense annotations. However, the NDCG metric favors the usually
applicable uncertain answers such as `I don't know. Crafting a model that
excels on both MRR and NDCG metrics is challenging. Ideally, an AI agent should
answer a human-like reply and validate the correctness of any answer. To
address this issue, we describe a two-step non-parametric ranking approach that
can merge strong MRR and NDCG models. Using our approach, we manage to keep
most MRR state-of-the-art performance (70.41% vs. 71.24%) and the NDCG
state-of-the-art performance (72.16% vs. 75.35%). Moreover, our approach won

and regression tasks on chest X-rays. In order to establish trust in the
clinical routine, the networks' prediction mechanism needs to be interpretable.
One principal approach to interpretation is feature attribution. Feature
attribution methods identify the importance of input features for the output
prediction. Building on Information Bottleneck Attribution (IBA) method, for
each prediction we identify the chest X-ray regions that have high mutual
information with the network's output. Original IBA identifies input regions
that have sufficient predictive information. We propose Inverse IBA to identify
all informative regions. Thus all predictive cues for pathologies are
highlighted on the X-rays, a desirable property for chest X-ray diagnosis.
Moreover, we propose Regression IBA for explaining regression models. Using
Regression IBA we observe that a model trained on cumulative severity score
labels implicitly learns the severity of different X-ray regions. Finally, we
propose Multi-layer IBA to generate higher resolution and more detailed
attribution/saliency maps. We evaluate our methods using both human-centric
(ground-truth-based) interpretability metrics, and human-independent feature
importance metrics on NIH Chest X-ray8 and BrixIA datasets. The Code is

of thoracic pathologies on chest x-rays. Their black-box nature has sparked
many recent works to explain the prediction via input feature attribution
methods (aka saliency methods). However, input feature attribution methods
merely identify the importance of input regions for the prediction and lack
semantic interpretation of model behavior. In this work, we first identify the
semantics associated with internal units (feature maps) of the network. We
proceed to investigate the following questions; Does a regression model that is
only trained with COVID-19 severity scores implicitly learn visual patterns
associated with thoracic pathologies? Does a network that is trained on weakly
labeled data (e.g. healthy, unhealthy) implicitly learn pathologies? Moreover,
we investigate the effect of pretraining and data imbalance on the
interpretability of learned features. In addition to the analysis, we propose
semantic attribution to semantically explain each prediction. We present our
findings using publicly available chest pathologies (CheXpert, NIH ChestX-ray8)
and COVID-19 datasets (BrixIA, and COVID-19 chest X-ray segmentation dataset).

explaining decisions made by artificial intelligence systems is becoming a more
and more important topic. Especially for image classification tasks, many
state-of-the-art tools to explain such classifiers rely on visual highlighting
of important areas of the input data. Contrary, counterfactual explanation
systems try to enable a counterfactual reasoning by modifying the input image
in a way such that the classifier would have made a different prediction. By
doing so, the users of counterfactual explanation systems are equipped with a
completely different kind of explanatory information. However, methods for
generating realistic counterfactual explanations for image classifiers are
still rare. Especially in medical contexts, where relevant information often
consists of textural and structural information, high-quality counterfactual
images have the potential to give meaningful insights into decision processes.
In this work, we present GANterfactual, an approach to generate such
counterfactual image explanations based on adversarial image-to-image
translation techniques. Additionally, we conduct a user study to evaluate our
approach in an exemplary medical use case. Our results show that, in the chosen
medical use-case, counterfactual explanations lead to significantly better
results regarding mental models, explanation satisfaction, trust, emotions, and
self-efficacy than two state-of-the-art systems that work with saliency maps,

on randomly sampled targets, yet the same systems are later used to predict
user behavior sequentially from a fixed point in time. Simulating online
recommender system performance is notoriously difficult and the discrepancy
between online and offline behaviors is typically not accounted for in offline
evaluations. This disparity permits weaknesses to go unnoticed until the model
is deployed in a production setting. In this paper, we first demonstrate how
omitting temporal context when evaluating recommender system performance leads
to false confidence. To overcome this, we postulate that offline evaluation
protocols can only model real-life use-cases if they account for temporal
context. Next, we propose a training procedure to further embed the temporal
context in existing models: we introduce it in a multi-objective approach to
traditionally time-unaware recommender systems and confirm its advantage via
the proposed evaluation protocol. Finally, we validate that the Pareto Fronts
obtained with the added objective dominate those produced by state-of-the-art
models that are only optimized for accuracy on three real-world publicly
available datasets. The results show that including our temporal objective can
improve recall@20 by up to 20%.]]></summary>

specifying constraints in mathematical form. Such specifications demand domain

to interpret natural language constraints for safe RL. To this end, we first
introduce HazardWorld, a new multi-task benchmark that requires an agent to
optimize reward while not violating constraints specified in free-form text. We
then develop an agent with a modular architecture that can interpret and adhere
to such textual constraints while learning new tasks. Our model consists of (1)
a constraint interpreter that encodes textual constraints into spatial and
temporal representations of forbidden states, and (2) a policy network that
uses these representations to produce a policy achieving minimal constraint
violations during training. Across different domains in HazardWorld, we show
that our method achieves higher rewards (up to11x) and fewer constraint
violations (by 1.8x) compared to existing approaches. However, in terms of
absolute performance, HazardWorld still poses significant challenges for agents
to learn efficiently, motivating the need for future work.]]></summary>

challenging AI workload in recent times. State-of-the-art recommendation models
are one of the largest models rivalling the likes of GPT-3 and Switch
Transformer. Challenges in deep learning recommendation models (DLRM) stem from
learning dense embeddings for each of the categorical values. These embedding
tables in industrial scale models can be as large as hundreds of terabytes.
Such large models lead to a plethora of engineering challenges, not to mention
prohibitive communication overheads, and slower training and inference times.
Of these, slower inference time directly impacts user experience. Model
compression for DLRM is gaining traction and the community has recently shown
impressive compression results. In this paper, we present Random Offset Block
Embedding Array (ROBE) as a low memory alternative to embedding tables which
provide orders of magnitude reduction in memory usage while maintaining
accuracy and boosting execution speed. ROBE is a simple fundamental approach in
improving both cache performance and the variance of randomized hashing, which
could be of independent interest in itself. We demonstrate that we can
successfully train DLRM models with same accuracy while using $1000 \times$
less memory. A $1000\times$ compressed model directly results in faster
inference without any engineering. In particular, we show that we can train
DLRM model using ROBE Array of size 100MB on a single GPU to achieve AUC of
0.8025 or higher as required by official MLPerf CriteoTB benchmark DLRM model
of 100GB while achieving about $2.7\times$ (170\%) improvement in inference

multivariate measurements and are studied in a variety of fields such as
psychology, ecology, and medicine. For Gaussian measurements, there are
classical tools such as factor analysis or principal component analysis with a
well-established theory and fast algorithms. Generalized Linear Latent Variable
models (GLLVM) generalize such factor models to non-Gaussian responses.
However, current algorithms for estimating model parameters in GLLVMs require
intensive computation and do not scale to large datasets with thousands of
observational units or responses. In this article, we propose a new approach
for fitting GLLVMs to such high-volume, high-dimensional datasets. We
approximate the likelihood using penalized quasi-likelihood and use a Newton
method and Fisher scoring to learn the model parameters. Our method greatly
reduces the computation time and can be easily parallelized, enabling
factorization at unprecedented scale using commodity hardware. We illustrate
application of our method on a dataset of 48,000 observational units with over
2,000 observed species in each unit, finding that most of the variability can

collected sparsely and irregularly in time while the data acquisition is
expensive and inconvenient. Examples include measurements of spine bone mineral
density, cancer growth through mammography or biopsy, a progression of
defective vision, or assessment of gait in patients with neurological
disorders. Since the data collection is often costly and inconvenient,
estimation of progression from sparse observations is of great interest for
practitioners.

From the statistical standpoint, such data is often analyzed in the context
of a mixed-effect model where time is treated as both a fixed-effect
(population progression curve) and a random-effect (individual variability).
Alternatively, researchers analyze Gaussian processes or functional data where
observations are assumed to be drawn from a certain distribution of processes.
These models are flexible but rely on probabilistic assumptions, require very
careful implementation, specific to the given problem, and tend to be slow in
practice.

In this study, we propose an alternative elementary framework for analyzing
longitudinal data, relying on matrix completion. Our method yields estimates of
progression curves by iterative application of the Singular Value
Decomposition. Our framework covers multivariate longitudinal data, regression,
and can be easily extended to other settings. As it relies on existing tools
for matrix algebra it is efficient and easy to implement.

We apply our methods to understand trends of progression of motor impairment
in children with Cerebral Palsy. Our model approximates individual progression
curves and explains 30% of the variability. Low-rank representation of
progression trends enables identification of different progression trends in
subtypes of Cerebral Palsy.]]></summary>

stands for Transformer Encoder Representations from Alteration. Recent
approaches often learn by using a single auxiliary task like contrastive
prediction, autoregressive prediction, or masked reconstruction. Unlike
previous methods, we use alteration along three orthogonal axes to pre-train
Transformer Encoders on a large amount of unlabeled speech. The model learns
through the reconstruction of acoustic frames from their altered counterpart,
where we use a stochastic policy to alter along various dimensions: time,
frequency, and magnitude. TERA can be used for speech representations
extraction or fine-tuning with downstream models. We evaluate TERA on several
downstream tasks, including phoneme classification, keyword spotting, speaker
recognition, and speech recognition. We present a large-scale comparison of
various self-supervised models. TERA achieves strong performance in the
comparison by improving upon surface features and outperforming previous
models. In our experiments, we study the effect of applying different
alteration techniques, pre-training on more data, and pre-training on various
features. We analyze different model sizes and find that smaller models are
strong representation learners than larger models, while larger models are more
effective for downstream fine-tuning than smaller models. Furthermore, we show
the proposed method is transferable to downstream datasets not used in

designing reward functions can be extremely challenging, a more promising
approach is to directly learn reward functions from human teachers.
Importantly, data from human teachers can be collected either passively or
actively in a variety of forms: passive data sources include demonstrations,
(e.g., kinesthetic guidance), whereas preferences (e.g., comparative rankings)
are actively elicited. Prior research has independently applied reward learning
to these different data sources. However, there exist many domains where
multiple sources are complementary and expressive. Motivated by this general
problem, we present a framework to integrate multiple sources of information,
which are either passively or actively collected from human users. In
particular, we present an algorithm that first utilizes user demonstrations to
initialize a belief about the reward function, and then actively probes the
user with preference queries to zero-in on their true reward. This algorithm
not only enables us combine multiple data sources, but it also informs the
robot when it should leverage each type of information. Further, our approach
accounts for the human's ability to provide data: yielding user-friendly
preference queries which are also theoretically optimal. Our extensive
simulated experiments and user studies on a Fetch mobile manipulator

discussions in requirements engineering (RE) practices, such as focus groups.
Different researchers motivated the transfer of these benefits into crowd-based
RE (CrowdRE) by using vision videos on social media platforms. So far, however,
little research explored the potential of using vision videos for CrowdRE in
detail. In this paper, we analyze and assess this potential, in particular,
focusing on video comments as a source of feedback. In a case study, we
analyzed 4505 comments on a vision video from YouTube. We found that the video
solicited 2770 comments from 2660 viewers in four days. This is more than 50%
of all comments the video received in four years. Even though only a certain
fraction of these comments are relevant to RE, the relevant comments address
typical intentions and topics of user feedback, such as feature request or
problem report. Besides the typical user feedback categories, we found more
than 300 comments that address the topic safety, which has not appeared in
previous analyses of user feedback. In an automated analysis, we compared the
performance of three machine learning algorithms on classifying the video
comments. Despite certain differences, the algorithms classified the video
comments well. Based on these findings, we conclude that the use of vision
videos for CrowdRE has a large potential. Despite the preliminary nature of the
case study, we are optimistic that vision videos can motivate stakeholders to
actively participate in a crowd and solicit numerous of video comments as a
valuable source of feedback.]]></summary>

which are hard to attack in a black-box manner, because of their
multiple-output characteristics and the diversity across architectures. To
pursue a high attack transferability, one plausible way is to find a common
property across detectors, which facilitates the discovery of common
weaknesses. We are the first to suggest that the relevance map from
interpreters for detectors is such a property. Based on it, we design a
Relevance Attack on Detectors (RAD), which achieves a state-of-the-art
transferability, exceeding existing results by above 20%. On MS COCO, the
detection mAPs for all 8 black-box architectures are more than halved and the
segmentation mAPs are also significantly influenced. Given the great
transferability of RAD, we generate the first adversarial dataset for object
detection and instance segmentation, i.e., Adversarial Objects in COntext

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The physical, black-box hard-label setting is arguably the most realistic
threat model for cyber-physical vision systems. In this setting, the attacker
only has query access to the model and only receives the top-1 class label
without confidence information. Creating small physical stickers that are
robust to environmental variation is difficult in the discrete and
discontinuous hard-label space because the attack must both design a small
shape to perturb within and find robust noise to fill it with. Unfortunately,
we find that existing $\ell_2$ or $\ell_\infty$ minimizing hard-label attacks
do not easily extend to finding such robust physical perturbation attacks.
Thus, we propose GRAPHITE, the first algorithm for hard-label physical attacks
on computer vision models. We show that "survivability", an estimate of
physical variation robustness, can be used in new ways to generate small masks
and is a sufficiently smooth function to optimize with gradient-free
optimization. We use GRAPHITE to attack a traffic sign classifier and a
publicly-available Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) tool using only
query access. We evaluate both tools in real-world field tests to measure its
physical-world robustness. We successfully cause a Stop sign to be
misclassified as a Speed Limit 30 km/hr sign in 95.7% of physical images and
cause errors in 75% of physical images for the ALPR tool.]]></summary>

timely and accurately identify people in need. However, recent concerns around
fairness and transparency of algorithmic decision-making are a significant
obstacle for applying these methods in practice. In this paper, we study if
humanitarian mapping approaches from space are prone to bias in their
predictions. We map village-level poverty and electricity rates in India based
on nighttime lights (NTLs) with linear regression and random forest and analyze
if the predictions systematically show prejudice against scheduled caste or
tribe communities. To achieve this, we design a causal approach to measure
counterfactual fairness based on propensity score matching. This allows to
compare villages within a community of interest to synthetic counterfactuals.
Our findings indicate that poverty is systematically overestimated and
electricity systematically underestimated for scheduled tribes in comparison to
a synthetic counterfactual group of villages. The effects have the opposite
direction for scheduled castes where poverty is underestimated and
electrification overestimated. These results are a warning sign for a variety
of applications in humanitarian mapping where fairness issues would compromise

for medical images. Compared to hand-labeled datasets, weak or inexact labels
can be acquired in large quantities at significantly lower cost and can provide
useful training signals for data-hungry models such as deep neural networks. We
consider weak labels in the form of pseudo-labels and propose a semi-weakly
supervised contrastive learning (SWCL) framework for representation learning
using semi-weakly annotated images. Specifically, we train a semi-supervised
model to propagate labels from a small dataset consisting of diverse
image-level annotations to a large unlabeled dataset. Using the propagated
labels, we generate a patch-level dataset for pretraining and formulate a
multi-label contrastive learning objective to capture position-specific
features encoded in each patch. We empirically validate the transfer learning
performance of SWCL on seven public retinal fundus datasets, covering three
disease classification tasks and two anatomical structure segmentation tasks.
Our experiment results suggest that, under very low data regime, large-scale
ImageNet pretraining on improved architecture remains a very strong baseline,
and recently proposed self-supervised methods falter in segmentation tasks,
possibly due to the strong invariant constraint imposed. Our method surpasses
all prior self-supervised methods and standard cross-entropy training, while
closing the gaps with ImageNet pretraining.]]></summary>

robust formulation to extract good out-of-sample performance in data-driven
optimization and learning problems. Acknowledging the distributional
uncertainty in learning from limited samples, the min-max formulations
introduce an adversarial inner player to explore unseen covariate data. The
resulting Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) formulations, which
include Wasserstein DRO formulations (our main focus), are specified using
optimal transportation phenomena. Upon describing how these
infinite-dimensional min-max problems can be approached via a
finite-dimensional dual reformulation, the tutorial moves into its main
component, namely, explaining a generic recipe for optimally selecting the size
of the adversary's budget. This is achieved by studying the limit behavior of
an optimal transport projection formulation arising from an inquiry on the
smallest confidence region that includes the unknown population risk minimizer.
Incidentally, this systematic prescription coincides with those in specific
examples in high-dimensional statistics and results in error bounds that are
free from the curse of dimensions. Equipped with this prescription, we present
a central limit theorem for the DRO estimator and provide a recipe for
constructing compatible confidence regions that are useful for uncertainty
quantification. The rest of the tutorial is devoted to insights into the nature
of the optimizers selected by the min-max formulations and additional

Unfortunately, computing the optimal number of points with standard dynamic

that adapts to the characteristics of the target distribution with minimal
hand-tuning. However, Slice Sampling's performance is highly sensitive to the
user-specified initial length scale hyperparameter and the method generally
struggles with poorly scaled or strongly correlated distributions. This paper
introduces Ensemble Slice Sampling (ESS), a new class of algorithms that
bypasses such difficulties by adaptively tuning the initial length scale and
utilising an ensemble of parallel walkers in order to efficiently handle strong
correlations between parameters. These affine-invariant algorithms are trivial
to construct, require no hand-tuning, and can easily be implemented in parallel
computing environments. Empirical tests show that Ensemble Slice Sampling can
improve efficiency by more than an order of magnitude compared to conventional
MCMC methods on a broad range of highly correlated target distributions. In
cases of strongly multimodal target distributions, Ensemble Slice Sampling can
sample efficiently even in high dimensions. We argue that the parallel,
black-box and gradient-free nature of the method renders it ideal for use in
scientific fields such as physics, astrophysics and cosmology which are
dominated by a wide variety of computationally expensive and non-differentiable
models.]]></summary>

this issue by introducing a \textit{weakly-supervised} paradigm for learning
MWPs. Our method only requires the annotations of the final answers and can
generate various solutions for a single problem. To boost weakly-supervised
learning, we propose a novel \textit{learning-by-fixing} (LBF) framework, which
corrects the misperceptions of the neural network via symbolic reasoning.
Specifically, for an incorrect solution tree generated by the neural network,
the \textit{fixing} mechanism propagates the error from the root node to the
leaf nodes and infers the most probable fix that can be executed to get the
desired answer. To generate more diverse solutions, \textit{tree
regularization} is applied to guide the efficient shrinkage and exploration of
the solution space, and a \textit{memory buffer} is designed to track and save
the discovered various fixes for each problem. Experimental results on the
Math23K dataset show the proposed LBF framework significantly outperforms
reinforcement learning baselines in weakly-supervised learning. Furthermore, it
achieves comparable top-1 and much better top-3/5 answer accuracies than
fully-supervised methods, demonstrating its strength in producing diverse
solutions.]]></summary>

essential, as it is often connected to vital decision-making. Compelling
attempts have been made in quantifying the uncertainty in image segmentation
architectures, e.g. to learn a density segmentation model conditioned on the
input image. Typical work in this field restricts these learnt densities to be
strictly Gaussian. In this paper, we propose to use a more flexible approach by
introducing Normalizing Flows (NFs), which enables the learnt densities to be
more complex and facilitate more accurate modeling for uncertainty. We prove
this hypothesis by adopting the Probabilistic U-Net and augmenting the
posterior density with an NF, allowing it to be more expressive. Our
qualitative as well as quantitative (GED and IoU) evaluations on the
multi-annotated and single-annotated LIDC-IDRI and Kvasir-SEG segmentation
datasets, respectively, show a clear improvement. This is mostly apparent in
the quantification of aleatoric uncertainty and the increased predictive
performance of up to 14 percent. This result strongly indicates that a more
flexible density model should be seriously considered in architectures that
attempt to capture segmentation ambiguity through density modeling. The benefit
of this improved modeling will increase human confidence in annotation and
segmentation, and enable eager adoption of the technology in practice.]]></summary>

supervision. Yet contrastive learning is susceptible to shortcuts -- i.e., it
may learn shortcut features irrelevant to the downstream task and discard
relevant information. Past work has addressed this limitation via handcrafted
data augmentations that eliminate the shortcut. However, handcrafted
augmentations are infeasible for data modalities that are not interpretable by
humans (e.g., radio signals). Further, even when the modality is interpretable
(e.g., RGB), sometimes eliminating the shortcut information may be undesirable.
For example, in multi-attribute classification, information related to one
attribute may act as a shortcut around other attributes. This paper presents
reconstructive contrastive learning (RCL), a framework for learning
unsupervised representations that are robust to shortcuts. The key idea is to
force the learned representation to reconstruct the input, which naturally
counters potential shortcuts. Extensive experiments verify that RCL is highly
robust to shortcuts and outperforms state-of-the-art contrastive learning
methods on both RGB and RF datasets for a variety of tasks.]]></summary>

operates robust against noisy labels. GALC-SLR estimates the noise confusion
matrix using single-label samples, then constructs an asymmetric loss
correction via estimated confusion matrix to avoid overfitting to the noisy
labels. Empirical results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Real world traffic sign recognition is an important step towards building
autonomous vehicles, most of which highly dependent on Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs). Recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to
adversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed to understand and
generate adversarial examples, such as gradient based attack, score based
attack, decision based attack, and transfer based attacks. However, most of
these algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because (1)
iteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast
moving car and (2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally
without considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems,
this paper proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real world
road sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: (1)
we leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip
those zero-contributed areas - this also helps to generate natural
perturbations, (2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a
single perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance
of the pre-trained attention map, (3) we design a simple objective function
that can be easily optimized, (4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real
world data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the
attack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a
quarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also
provides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability.

now capturing and processing more sensors at higher frequency than ever before.
These new data, due to their volume and novelty, cannot be effectively consumed
without the help of data-driven techniques. Deep learning is emerging as a
promising technique to analyze these data, particularly in soft sensor
modeling. The strong representational capabilities of complex data and the
flexibility it offers from an architectural perspective make it a topic of
active applied research in industrial settings. However, the successful
applications of deep learning in soft sensing are still not widely integrated
in factory control systems, because most of the research on soft sensing do not
have access to large scale industrial data which are varied, noisy and
incomplete. The results published in most research papers are therefore not
easily reproduced when applied to the variety of data in industrial settings.
Here we provide manufacturing data sets that are much larger and more complex
than public open soft sensor data. Moreover, the data sets are from Seagate
factories on active service with only necessary anonymization, so that they
reflect the complex and noisy nature of real-world data. We introduce a
variance weighted multi-headed auto-encoder classification model that fits well
into the high-dimensional and highly imbalanced data. Besides the use of
weighting or sampling methods to handle the highly imbalanced data, the model
also simultaneously predicts multiple outputs by exploiting output-supervised
representation learning and multi-task weighting.]]></summary>

reinforcement learning (RL), especially in highly-stochastic or partially

work we introduce a method that allows an agent to "look into the future"
without explicitly predicting it. Namely, we propose to allow an agent, during
its training on past experience, to observe what \emph{actually} happened in
the future at that time, while enforcing an information bottleneck to avoid the
agent overly relying on this privileged information. This gives our agent the
opportunity to utilize rich and useful information about the future trajectory
dynamics in addition to the present. Our method, Policy Gradients Incorporating
the Future (PGIF), is easy to implement and versatile, being applicable to
virtually any policy gradient algorithm. We apply our proposed method to a

task that requires a specific series of actions due to sparse rewards. To solve
this problem, reverse curriculum generation (RCG) provides a reverse expansion
approach that automatically generates a curriculum for the agent to learn. More
specifically, RCG adapts the initial state distribution from the neighborhood
of a goal to a distance as training proceeds. However, the initial state
distribution generated for each iteration might be biased, thus making the
policy overfit or slowing down the reverse expansion rate. While training RCG
for actor-critic (AC) based RL algorithms, this poor generalization and slow
convergence might be induced by the tight coupling between an AC pair.
Therefore, we propose a parallelized approach that simultaneously trains
multiple AC pairs and periodically exchanges their critics. We empirically
demonstrate that this proposed approach can improve RCG in performance and
convergence, and it can also be applied to other AC based RL algorithms with

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To remove the effects of adversarial perturbations, preprocessing defenses
such as pixel discretization are appealing due to their simplicity but have so
far been shown to be ineffective except on simple datasets such as MNIST,
leading to the belief that pixel discretization approaches are doomed to
failure as a defense technique. This paper revisits the pixel discretization
approaches. We hypothesize that the reason why existing approaches have failed
is that they have used a fixed codebook for the entire dataset. In particular,
we find that can lead to situations where images become more susceptible to
adversarial perturbations and also suffer significant loss of accuracy after
discretization. We propose a novel image preprocessing technique called
Essential Features that uses an adaptive codebook that is based on per-image
content and threat model. Essential Features adaptively selects a separable set
of color clusters for each image to reduce the color space while preserving the
pertinent features of the original image, maximizing both separability and
representation of colors. Additionally, to limit the adversary's ability to
influence the chosen color clusters, Essential Features takes advantage of
spatial correlation with an adaptive blur that moves pixels closer to their
original value without destroying original edge information. We design several
adaptive attacks and find that our approach is more robust than previous
baselines on $L_\infty$ and $L_2$ bounded attacks for several challenging
datasets including CIFAR-10, GTSRB, RESISC45, and ImageNet.]]></summary>

graph with low sparsity, a node's adjacency vector is a long and sparse
representation, limiting the practical utilization of existing machine learning
methods on nodal features. In practice, graph embedding (graph representation
learning) attempts to learn a lower-dimensional representation vector for each
node or the whole graph while maintaining the most basic information of graph.
Since various machine learning methods can efficiently process
lower-dimensional vectors, graph embedding has recently attracted a lot of
attention. However, most node embedding or whole graph embedding methods suffer
from the problem of having more sophisticated methodology, hyperparameter
optimization, and low explainability. This paper proposes a
hyperparameter-free, extensible, and explainable whole graph embedding method,
combining the DHC (Degree, H-index and Coreness) theorem and Shannon Entropy
(E), abbreviated as DHC-E. The new whole graph embedding scheme can obtain a
trade-off between the simplicity and the quality under some supervised
classification learning tasks, using molecular, social, and brain networks. In
addition, the proposed approach has a good performance in lower-dimensional
graph visualization. The new methodology is overall simple,
hyperparameter-free, extensible, and explainable for whole graph embedding with
promising potential for exploring graph classification, prediction, and
lower-dimensional graph visualization.]]></summary>

assumption, i.e., assuming that independencies found in the data are due to
separations in the true causal graph. This assumption can, however, be violated
in many ways, including xor connections, deterministic functions or cancelling
paths. In this work, we propose a weaker assumption that we call $2$-adjacency
faithfulness. In contrast to adjacency faithfulness, which assumes that there
is no conditional independence between each pair of variables that are
connected in the causal graph, we only require no conditional independence
between a node and a subset of its Markov blanket that can contain up to two
nodes. Equivalently, we adapt orientation faithfulness to this setting. We
further propose a sound orientation rule for causal discovery that applies
under weaker assumptions. As a proof of concept, we derive a modified Grow and
Shrink algorithm that recovers the Markov blanket of a target node and prove
its correctness under strictly weaker assumptions than the standard
faithfulness assumption.]]></summary>

interactions between different agents transform simple local rule-sets into
nonlinear emergent behaviors. While some recent studies unveil associations
between the network structure and the underlying dynamical process, identifying
stochastic nonlinear dynamical processes continues to be an outstanding
problem. Here we develop a simple data-driven framework based on
operator-theoretic techniques to identify and control stochastic nonlinear
dynamics taking place over large-scale networks. The proposed approach requires
no prior knowledge of the network structure and identifies the underlying
dynamics solely using a collection of two-step snapshots of the states. This
data-driven system identification is achieved by using the Koopman operator to
find a low dimensional representation of the dynamical patterns that evolve
linearly. Further, we use the global linear Koopman model to solve critical
control problems by applying to model predictive control (MPC)--typically, a
challenging proposition when applied to large networks. We show that our
proposed approach tackles this by converting the original nonlinear programming
into a more tractable optimization problem that is both convex and with far

efficient methods that need no design or domain knowledge. Unlike deep neural
networks, there is no need to hand-craft a network architecture; the kernels
are randomly generated and only the linear classifier needs training. A
recently proposed method, RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transforms (ROCKETs), has
shown high accuracy across a range of time-series data sets. Here we propose a
multi-scale version of this method, using both high- and low-frequency
components. We apply our methods to inter-burst detection in a cohort of
preterm EEG recorded from 36 neonates <30 weeks gestational age. Two features
from the convolution of 10,000 random kernels are combined using ridge
regression. The proposed multi-scale ROCKET method out-performs the method
without scale: median (interquartile range, IQR) Matthews correlation
coefficient (MCC) of 0.859 (0.815 to 0.874) for multi-scale versus 0.841 (0.807
to 0.865) without scale, p<0.001. The proposed method lags behind an existing
feature-based machine learning method developed with deep domain knowledge, but
is fast to train and can quickly set an initial baseline threshold of
performance for generic and biomedical time-series classification.]]></summary>

contact tracing. To date, more than 100 contact tracing applications have been
published to slow down the spread of highly contagious Covid-19. Despite subtle
variabilities among these applications, all of them achieve contact tracing by
manipulating the following three components: a) use a personal device to
identify the user while designing a secure protocol to anonymize the user's
identity; b) leverage networking technologies to analyze and store the data; c)
exploit rich sensing features on the user device to detect the interaction
among users and thus estimate the exposure risk. This paper reviews the current
digital contact tracing based on these three components. We focus on two
personal devices that are intimate to the user: smartphones and wearables. We
discuss the centralized and decentralized networking approaches that use to
facilitate the data flow. Lastly, we investigate the sensing feature available
on smartphones and wearables to detect the proximity between any two users and

examples. Applications of ML to voice biometrics authentication are no
exception. Yet, the implications of audio adversarial examples on these
real-world systems remain poorly understood given that most research targets
limited defenders who can only listen to the audio samples. Conflating
detectability of an attack with human perceptibility, research has focused on
methods that aim to produce imperceptible adversarial examples which humans
cannot distinguish from the corresponding benign samples. We argue that this
perspective is coarse for two reasons: 1. Imperceptibility is impossible to
verify; it would require an experimental process that encompasses variations in
listener training, equipment, volume, ear sensitivity, types of background
noise etc, and 2. It disregards pipeline-based detection clues that realistic
defenders leverage. This results in adversarial examples that are ineffective
in the presence of knowledgeable defenders. Thus, an adversary only needs an
audio sample to be plausible to a human. We thus introduce surreptitious
adversarial examples, a new class of attacks that evades both human and
pipeline controls. In the white-box setting, we instantiate this class with a
joint, multi-stage optimization attack. Using an Amazon Mechanical Turk user
study, we show that this attack produces audio samples that are more
surreptitious than previous attacks that aim solely for imperceptibility.
Lastly we show that surreptitious adversarial examples are challenging to
develop in the black-box setting.]]></summary>

developing Cyber-Physical and Safety-Critical Systems. The system's scheduler
uses the estimated WCET to schedule each task of these systems, and failure may
lead to catastrophic events. It is thus imperative to build provably reliable
systems. WCET is available to us in the last stage of systems development when
the hardware is available and the application code is compiled on it. Different
methodologies measure the WCET, but none of them give early insights on WCET,
which is crucial for system development. If the system designers overestimate
WCET in the early stage, then it would lead to the overqualified system, which
will increase the cost of the final product, and if they underestimate WCET in
the early stage, then it would lead to financial loss as the system would not
perform as expected. This paper estimates early WCET using Deep Neural Networks
as an approximate predictor model for hardware architecture and compiler. This
model predicts the WCET based on the source code without compiling and running
on the hardware architecture. Our WCET prediction model is created using the
Pytorch framework. The resulting WCET is too erroneous to be used as an upper
bound on the WCET. However, getting these results in the early stages of system
development is an essential prerequisite for the system's dimensioning and

healthcare and supports the diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders. Deep
learning methods are a successful and popular technique to detect indications
of disorders from an ECG signal. However, there are open questions around the
robustness of these methods to various factors, including physiological ECG
noise. In this study we generate clean and noisy versions of an ECG dataset
before applying Symmetric Projection Attractor Reconstruction (SPAR) and
scalogram image transformations. A pretrained convolutional neural network is
trained using transfer learning to classify these image transforms. For the
clean ECG dataset, F1 scores for SPAR attractor and scalogram transforms were
0.70 and 0.79, respectively, and the scores decreased by less than 0.05 for the
noisy ECG datasets. Notably, when the network trained on clean data was used to
classify the noisy datasets, performance decreases of up to 0.18 in F1 scores
were seen. However, when the network trained on the noisy data was used to
classify the clean dataset, the performance decrease was less than 0.05. We
conclude that physiological ECG noise impacts classification using deep

noisy ECG signals in the training data when developing supervised networks for

challenges the problem of separating the whole-home electricity usage into
appliance-specific individual consumptions, which is a typical application of
data analysis. {NILM aims to help households understand how the energy is used
and consequently tell them how to effectively manage the energy, thus allowing
energy efficiency which is considered as one of the twin pillars of sustainable
energy policy (i.e., energy efficiency and renewable energy).} Although NILM is
unidentifiable, it is widely believed that the NILM problem can be addressed by
data science. Most of the existing approaches address the energy disaggregation
problem by conventional techniques such as sparse coding, non-negative matrix
factorization, and hidden Markov model. Recent advances reveal that deep neural
networks (DNNs) can get favorable performance for NILM since DNNs can
inherently learn the discriminative signatures of the different appliances. In
this paper, we propose a novel method named adversarial energy disaggregation
(AED) based on DNNs. We introduce the idea of adversarial learning into NILM,
which is new for the energy disaggregation task. Our method trains a generator
and multiple discriminators via an adversarial fashion. The proposed method not
only learns shard representations for different appliances, but captures the
specific multimode structures of each appliance. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets verify that our method can achieve new state-of-the-art

fields such as computer vision, computational biology and chemistry, where data
are naturally explained by graphs. However, unlike traditional convolutional
neural networks, deep graph networks do not necessarily yield better
performance than shallow graph networks. This behavior usually stems from the
over-smoothing phenomenon. In this work, we propose a family of architectures
to control this behavior by design. Our networks are motivated by numerical
methods for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) on manifolds, and as
such, their behavior can be explained by similar analysis. Moreover, as we
demonstrate using an extensive set of experiments, our PDE-motivated networks
can generalize and be effective for various types of problems from different
fields. Our architectures obtain better or on par with the current
state-of-the-art results for problems that are typically approached using
different architectures.]]></summary>

power of edge devices, makes it vulnerable to attacks against privacy and
security. The privacy risk for a peer is that the model update she computes on
her private data may, when sent to the model manager, leak information on those
private data. Even more obvious are security attacks, whereby one or several
malicious peers return wrong model updates in order to disrupt the learning
process and lead to a wrong model being learned. In this paper we build a
federated learning framework that offers privacy to the participating peers as
well as security against Byzantine and poisoning attacks. Our framework
consists of several protocols that provide strong privacy to the participating
peers via unlinkable anonymity and that are rationally sustainable based on the
co-utility property. In other words, no rational party is interested in
deviating from the proposed protocols. We leverage the notion of co-utility to
build a decentralized co-utile reputation management system that provides
incentives for parties to adhere to the protocols. Unlike privacy protection
via differential privacy, our approach preserves the values of model updates
and hence the accuracy of plain federated learning; unlike privacy protection
via update aggregation, our approach preserves the ability to detect bad model
updates while substantially reducing the computational overhead compared to
methods based on homomorphic encryption.]]></summary>

patients timely and increase the cure rate, thus further suppressing the spread

proposed network contains two stages: the first one is a lung region
segmentation step and is used to exclude irrelevant factors, and the second is
a detection and recommendation stage. Under this framework, in the second
stage, we develop a dual-children network (DuCN) based on a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to simultaneously realize the disease diagnosis and similar case
recommendation. Besides, we employ triplet loss and intrapulmonary distance
maps to assist the detection, which helps incorporate tiny differences between
two images and is conducive to improving the diagnostic accuracy. For each
confirmed COVID-19 case, we give similar cases to provide radiologists with
diagnosis and treatment references. We conduct experiments on a large publicly

experiences, where control over information (or how it is presented) is given
to individual audience members. Measuring and understanding audience engagement
with this media is important in at least two ways: (1) a post-hoc understanding
of how engaged audiences are with the content will help production teams learn
from experience and improve future productions; (2), this type of media has
potential for real-time measures of engagement to be used to enhance the user
experience by adapting content on-the-fly. Engagement is typically measured by
asking samples of users to self-report, which is time consuming and expensive.
In some domains, however, interaction data have been used to infer engagement.
Fortuitously, the nature of interactive media facilitates a much richer set of
interaction data than traditional media; our research aims to understand if
these data can be used to infer audience engagement. In this paper, we report a
study using data captured from audience interactions with an interactive TV
show to model and predict engagement. We find that temporal metrics, including
overall time spent on the experience and the interval between events, are
predictive of engagement. The results demonstrate that interaction data can be
used to infer users' engagement during and after an experience, and the
proposed techniques are relevant to better understand audience preference and
responses.]]></summary>

communicate among themselves via discrete tokens, accomplishing as a team what
agents would be unable to do alone. However, the current standard of using

Inspired by word embedding techniques from natural language processing, we
propose neural agent architectures that enables them to communicate via
discrete tokens derived from a learned, continuous space. We show in a decision
theoretic framework that our technique optimizes communication over a wide
range of scenarios, whereas one-hot tokens are only optimal under restrictive
assumptions. In self-play experiments, we validate that our trained agents
learn to cluster tokens in semantically-meaningful ways, allowing them
communicate in noisy environments where other techniques fail. Lastly, we
demonstrate both that agents using our method can effectively respond to novel
human communication and that humans can understand unlabeled emergent agent

comes with the drawback of finding the right query for a certain information
need. Inspired by human behavior to disambiguate a question, we propose to
query LMs by example. To clarify the ambivalent question "Who does Neuer play
for?", a successful strategy is to demonstrate the relation using another
subject, e.g., "Ronaldo plays for Portugal. Who does Neuer play for?". We apply
this approach of querying by example to the LAMA probe and obtain substantial
improvements of up to 37.8% for BERT-large on the T-REx data when providing
only 10 demonstrations--even outperforming a baseline that queries the model
with up to 40 paraphrases of the question. The examples are provided through
the model's context and thus require neither fine-tuning nor an additional

initial policy without any prior knowledge of the dynamics model and additional
offline data. We propose an algorithm, Co-trained Barrier Certificate for Safe
RL (CRABS), which iteratively learns barrier certificates, dynamics models, and
policies. The barrier certificates, learned via adversarial training, ensure
the policy's safety assuming calibrated learned dynamics model. We also add a
regularization term to encourage larger certified regions to enable better
exploration. Empirical simulations show that zero safety violations are already
challenging for a suite of simple environments with only 2-4 dimensional state
space, especially if high-reward policies have to visit regions near the safety
boundary. Prior methods require hundreds of violations to achieve decent
rewards on these tasks, whereas our proposed algorithms incur zero violations.]]></summary>

deterministic time series, provides unsupervised filtering, state-space
reconstruction, identification of the underlying differential equations and
forecasting. Without a priori information on the signal, we embed the time
series in a state space, where deterministic structures, i.e. attractors, are
revealed. Under the assumption that the evolution of solution trajectories is
described by an unknown dynamical system, we filter out stochastic outliers.
The embedding function, the solution trajectories and the dynamical systems are
constructed using deep neural networks, respectively. By exploiting the
differentiability of the neural solution trajectory, the neural dynamical
system is defined locally at each time, mitigating the need for propagating
gradients through numerical solvers. On a chaotic time series masked by
additive Gaussian noise, we demonstrate the filtering ability and the
predictive power of the proposed framework.]]></summary>

behaviours without reliance on manually designed reward functions. To that end,
skill discovery methods have been used to learn the intrinsic options available
to an agent using task-agnostic objectives. However, without the guidance of
task-specific rewards, emergent behaviours are generally useless due to the
under-constrained problem of skill discovery in complex and high-dimensional

time to operate optimally. Yet humans rarely require long periods training to
perform well on novel tasks, such as computer games, once they are provided
with an accurate program of instructions. We used perceptual control theory
(PCT) to construct a simple closed-loop model which requires no training
samples and training time within a video game study using the Arcade Learning
Environment (ALE). The model was programmed to parse inputs from the
environment into hierarchically organised perceptual signals, and it computed a
dynamic error signal by subtracting the incoming signal for each perceptual
variable from a reference signal to drive output signals to reduce this error.
We tested the same model across two different Atari paddle games Breakout and
Pong to achieve performance at least as high as DRL paradigms, and close to
good human performance. Our study shows that perceptual control models, based
on simple assumptions, can perform well without learning. We conclude by
specifying a parsimonious role of learning that may be more similar to
psychological functioning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exponential families are widely used in machine learning; they include many
distributions in continuous and discrete domains (e.g., Gaussian, Dirichlet,
Poisson, and categorical distributions via the softmax transformation).
Distributions in each of these families have fixed support. In contrast, for
finite domains, there has been recent works on sparse alternatives to softmax
(e.g. sparsemax, $\alpha$-entmax, and fusedmax) and corresponding losses, which
have varying support.

This paper expands that line of work in several directions: first, it extends
$\Omega$-regularized prediction maps and Fenchel-Young losses to arbitrary
domains (possibly countably infinite or continuous). For linearly parametrized
families, we show that minimization of Fenchel-Young losses is equivalent to
moment matching of the statistics, generalizing a fundamental property of
exponential families. When $\Omega$ is a Tsallis negentropy with parameter
$\alpha$, we obtain "deformed exponential families," which include
$\alpha$-entmax and sparsemax ($\alpha$ = 2) as particular cases. For quadratic
energy functions in continuous domains, the resulting densities are
$\beta$-Gaussians, an instance of elliptical distributions that contain as
particular cases the Gaussian, biweight, triweight and Epanechnikov densities,
and for which we derive closed-form expressions for the variance, Tsallis
entropy, and Fenchel-Young loss. When $\Omega$ is a total variation or Sobolev
regularizer, we obtain a continuous version of the fusedmax. Finally, we
introduce continuous-domain attention mechanisms, deriving efficient gradient
backpropagation algorithms for $\alpha \in \{1, 4/3, 3/2, 2\}$. Using them, we
demonstrate our sparse continuous distributions for attention-based audio
classification and visual question answering, showing that they allow attending
to time intervals and compact regions.]]></summary>

the downstream tasks, e.g., image classification in computer vision. However,
extensive experiments have shown that, prominent neural architectures, such as
ResNet in computer vision and LSTM in natural language processing, are
generally good at extracting patterns from the input data and perform well on
different downstream tasks. These observations inspire us to ask: Is it
necessary to use the performance of specific downstream tasks to evaluate and
search for good neural architectures? Can we perform NAS effectively and
efficiently while being agnostic to the downstream task? In this work, we
attempt to affirmatively answer the above two questions and improve the
state-of-the-art NAS solution by proposing a novel and generic NAS framework,
termed Generic NAS (GenNAS). GenNAS does not use task-specific labels but
instead adopts \textit{regression} on a set of manually designed synthetic
signal bases for architecture evaluation. Such a self-supervised regression
task can effectively evaluate the intrinsic power of an architecture to capture
and transform the input signal patterns, and allow more sufficient usage of
training samples. We then propose an automatic task search to optimize the
combination of synthetic signals using limited downstream-task-specific labels,
further improving the performance of GenNAS. We also thoroughly evaluate
GenNAS's generality and end-to-end NAS performance on all search spaces, which
outperforms almost all existing works with significant speedup.]]></summary>

approximating latent states produced by this process in situations where large

accounts of incentive salience attribution we designed an ANN for estimating

Through model comparison and inspection we show that our approach outperforms

classification is of crucial importance to address this environmental

texture features, and Fourier descriptors. These attributes are then
transformed into a better representation by neural network-based encoders
before a support vector machine (SVM) model is utilized to classify different
leaves. Overall, our approach performs a state-of-the-art result on the Flavia

both unweighted and weighted graphs. Our empirical evaluation shows that this
framework improves the state-of-the-art trade-offs between speed and quality of

safety-critical tasks. While existing mathematical programming methods offer
theoretical guarantees in the context of constrained Markov decision processes,

learning policy networks as function approximators. In this paper, we propose
an extension of soft actor critic model to estimate the execution risk of a

adding an extra risk term in the loss function of the policy network. We define
the execution risk in an accurate form, as opposed to approximating it through
a summation of immediate risks at each time step that leads to conservative
plans. Our proposed model is conditioned on a continuous spectrum of risk
bounds, allowing the user to adjust the risk-averse level of the agent on the
fly. Through a set of experiments, we show the advantage of our model in terms

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Previous work has shown that neural architectures are able to perform optical
music recognition (OMR) on monophonic and homophonic music with high accuracy.
However, piano and orchestral scores frequently exhibit polyphonic passages,
which add a second dimension to the task. Monophonic and homophonic music can
be described as homorhythmic, or having a single musical rhythm. Polyphonic
music, on the other hand, can be seen as having multiple rhythmic sequences, or
voices, concurrently. We first introduce a workflow for creating large-scale
polyphonic datasets suitable for end-to-end recognition from sheet music
publicly available on the MuseScore forum. We then propose two novel
formulations for end-to-end polyphonic OMR -- one treating the problem as a
type of multi-task binary classification, and the other treating it as
multi-sequence detection. Building upon the encoder-decoder architecture and an
image encoder proposed in past work on end-to-end OMR, we propose two novel
decoder models -- FlagDecoder and RNNDecoder -- that correspond to the two
formulations. Finally, we compare the empirical performance of these end-to-end
approaches to polyphonic OMR and observe a new state-of-the-art performance
with our multi-sequence detection decoder, RNNDecoder.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many real-world multi-agent cooperative tasks, due to high cost and risk,
agents cannot interact with the environment and collect experiences during
learning, but have to learn from offline datasets. However, the transition
probabilities calculated from the dataset can be much different from the
transition probabilities induced by the learned policies of other agents,
creating large errors in value estimates. Moreover, the experience
distributions of agents' datasets may vary wildly due to diverse behavior
policies, causing large difference in value estimates between agents.
Consequently, agents will learn uncoordinated suboptimal policies. In this
paper, we propose MABCQ, which exploits value deviation and transition
normalization to modify the transition probabilities. Value deviation
optimistically increases the transition probabilities of high-value next
states, and transition normalization normalizes the biased transition
probabilities of next states. They together encourage agents to discover
potential optimal and coordinated policies. Mathematically, we prove the
convergence of Q-learning under the non-stationary transition probabilities
after modification. Empirically, we show that MABCQ greatly outperforms
baselines and reduces the difference in value estimates between agents.]]></summary>

on the Internet. As a consequence, most attacks (i.e., SQL injection, XSS) use
HTTP as the transport mechanism. Therefore, it is crucial to develop an
intelligent solution that would allow to effectively detect and filter out
anomalies in HTTP traffic. Currently, most of the anomaly detection systems are
either rule-based or trained using manually selected features. We propose
utilizing modern unsupervised language representation model for embedding HTTP
requests and then using it to classify anomalies in the traffic. The solution
is motivated by methods used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) such as
Doc2Vec which could potentially capture the true understanding of HTTP
messages, and therefore improve the efficiency of Intrusion Detection System.
In our work, we not only aim at generating a suitable embedding space, but also
at the interpretability of the proposed model. We decided to use the current
state-of-the-art RoBERTa, which, as far as we know, has never been used in a
similar problem. To verify how the solution would work in real word conditions,
we train the model using only legitimate traffic. We also try to explain the
results based on clusters that occur in the vectorized requests space and a
simple logistic regression classifier. We compared our approach with the
similar, previously proposed methods. We evaluate the feasibility of our method
on three different datasets: CSIC2010, CSE-CIC-IDS2018 and one that we prepared
ourselves. The results we show are comparable to others or better, and most
importantly - interpretable.]]></summary>

especially in night vision scenarios. Thus, infrared cameras are often
leveraged to help enhance the visual effects via detecting infrared radiation
in the surrounding environment, but the infrared videos are undesirable due to
the lack of detailed semantic information. In such a case, an effective
video-to-video translation method from the infrared domain to the visible light
counterpart is strongly needed by overcoming the intrinsic huge gap between
infrared and visible fields. To address this challenging problem, we propose an
infrared-to-visible (I2V) video translation method I2V-GAN to generate
fine-grained and spatial-temporal consistent visible light videos by given
unpaired infrared videos. Technically, our model capitalizes on three types of
constraints: 1)adversarial constraint to generate synthetic frames that are
similar to the real ones, 2)cyclic consistency with the introduced perceptual
loss for effective content conversion as well as style preservation, and
3)similarity constraints across and within domains to enhance the content and
motion consistency in both spatial and temporal spaces at a fine-grained level.
Furthermore, the current public available infrared and visible light datasets
are mainly used for object detection or tracking, and some are composed of
discontinuous images which are not suitable for video tasks. Thus, we provide a
new dataset for I2V video translation, which is named IRVI. Specifically, it
has 12 consecutive video clips of vehicle and monitoring scenes, and both
infrared and visible light videos could be apart into 24352 frames.
Comprehensive experiments validate that I2V-GAN is superior to the compared
SOTA methods in the translation of I2V videos with higher fluency and finer
semantic details. The code and IRVI dataset are available at
https://github.com/BIT-DA/I2V-GAN.]]></summary>

their exceptional ability to find complex relations in large datasets, the
strengthening of regulations on data ownership and privacy is causing
increasing difficulty in its application to medical data. In light of this,
Federated Learning has recently been proposed as a solution to train on private

particularly appealing in the field of healthcare, where patient data is highly

In this paper, we propose Personalized Federated Cluster Models, a hierarchical
clustering-based FL process, to predict Major Depressive Disorder severity from

we address problems caused by non-IID data, showing an accuracy increase in

Existing NAS algorithms generally evaluate the fitness of a new architecture by

problem in clinical practice and clinical studies. A novel approach for dealing
with missing data are Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), which have been
generating huge research interest in image generation and transformation.
Recently, researchers have attempted to apply GANs to missing data generation
and imputation for EHR data: a major challenge here is the categorical nature
of the data. State-of-the-art solutions to the GAN-based generation of
categorical data involve either reinforcement learning, or learning a
bidirectional mapping between the categorical and the real latent feature
space, so that the GANs only need to generate real-valued features. However,
these methods are designed to generate complete feature vectors instead of
imputing only the subsets of missing features. In this paper we propose a
simple and yet effective approach that is based on previous work on GANs for
data imputation. We first motivate our solution by discussing the reason why
adversarial training often fails in case of categorical features. Then we
derive a novel way to re-code the categorical features to stabilize the
adversarial training. Based on experiments on two real-world EHR data with
multiple settings, we show that our imputation approach largely improves the
prediction accuracy, compared to more traditional data imputation approaches.]]></summary>

representation learning to learn a structured latent space capable of
separately clustering multiple classes. It has been shown to produce state of
the art results for image-based classification problems. We introduce a
weighted contrastive loss suitable for regression tasks applied to a

various geographic and demographic clusters of the adult population. Surveys,

open question at present whether such an endeavor is feasible, and how it
compares to baselines that only use constant priors. To our knowledge, a proper
methodology and evaluation results using real data has also not been presented.
In this article, we present such a methodology and experimental study, using

estimation by representing the human skeleton as an undirected graph. However,
this representation fails to reflect the articulated characteristic of human
skeletons as the hierarchical orders among the joints are not explicitly
presented. In this paper, we propose to represent the human skeleton as a
directed graph with the joints as nodes and bones as edges that are directed
from parent joints to child joints. By so doing, the directions of edges can
explicitly reflect the hierarchical relationships among the nodes. Based on
this representation, we further propose a spatial-temporal conditional directed
graph convolution to leverage varying non-local dependence for different poses
by conditioning the graph topology on input poses. Altogether, we form a
U-shaped network, named U-shaped Conditional Directed Graph Convolutional
Network, for 3D human pose estimation from monocular videos. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our method, we conducted extensive experiments on two
challenging large-scale benchmarks: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Both
quantitative and qualitative results show that our method achieves top
performance. Also, ablation studies show that directed graphs can better
exploit the hierarchy of articulated human skeletons than undirected graphs,
and the conditional connections can yield adaptive graph topologies for
different poses.]]></summary>

vision and graphics. The required smoothing properties can be different or even
contradictive among different tasks. Nevertheless, the inherent smoothing
nature of one smoothing operator is usually fixed and thus cannot meet the
various requirements of different applications. In this paper, we first
introduce the truncated Huber penalty function which shows strong flexibility
under different parameter settings. A generalized framework is then proposed
with the introduced truncated Huber penalty function. When combined with its
strong flexibility, our framework is able to achieve diverse smoothing natures
where contradictive smoothing behaviors can even be achieved. It can also yield
the smoothing behavior that can seldom be achieved by previous methods, and
superior performance is thus achieved in challenging cases. These together
enable our framework capable of a range of applications and able to outperform
the state-of-the-art approaches in several tasks, such as image detail
enhancement, clip-art compression artifacts removal, guided depth map
restoration, image texture removal, etc. In addition, an efficient numerical
solution is provided and its convergence is theoretically guaranteed even the
optimization framework is non-convex and non-smooth. A simple yet effective
approach is further proposed to reduce the computational cost of our method
while maintaining its performance. The effectiveness and superior performance
of our approach are validated through comprehensive experiments in a range of
applications. Our code is available at

annotate data by clicks, which costs only several seconds for an image.
However, applying clicks to learn video semantic segmentation model has not
been explored before. In this work, we propose an effective weakly-supervised
video semantic segmentation pipeline with click annotations, called WeClick,
for saving laborious annotating effort by segmenting an instance of the
semantic class with only a single click. Since detailed semantic information is
not captured by clicks, directly training with click labels leads to poor
segmentation predictions. To mitigate this problem, we design a novel memory
flow knowledge distillation strategy to exploit temporal information (named
memory flow) in abundant unlabeled video frames, by distilling the neighboring
predictions to the target frame via estimated motion. Moreover, we adopt
vanilla knowledge distillation for model compression. In this case, WeClick
learns compact video semantic segmentation models with the low-cost click
annotations during the training phase yet achieves real-time and accurate
models during the inference period. Experimental results on Cityscapes and
Camvid show that WeClick outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, increases
performance by 10.24% mIoU than baseline, and achieves real-time execution.]]></summary>

face recognition which uses cues from the distributed face recognition
mechanism of the brain, and by gathering engineering equivalent of these cues

(PCs) extracted from target images are used in a manner which is simple, and

analysis for dimensionality reduction. Our model uses multi-layer perceptrons
(MLP) to classify these three features and fuse them at the decision level
using sum rule. A computational theory is first developed by using concepts
from the information processing mechanism of the brain. Extensive experiments
are carried out using ten publicly available datasets to validate our proposed
model's performance in recognizing faces with extreme variation of

extremely promising when compared with other face recognition algorithms

visual content is challenging. Generation metrics, such as BLEU scores favor
correct syntax over semantics. Hence a discriminative approach is often used,
where an agent ranks a set of candidate options. The mean reciprocal rank (MRR)
metric evaluates the model performance by taking into account the rank of a
single human-derived answer. This approach, however, raises a new challenge:
the ambiguity and synonymy of answers, for instance, semantic equivalence
(e.g., `yeah' and `yes'). To address this, the normalized discounted cumulative
gain (NDCG) metric has been used to capture the relevance of all the correct
answers via dense annotations. However, the NDCG metric favors the usually
applicable uncertain answers such as `I don't know. Crafting a model that
excels on both MRR and NDCG metrics is challenging. Ideally, an AI agent should
answer a human-like reply and validate the correctness of any answer. To
address this issue, we describe a two-step non-parametric ranking approach that
can merge strong MRR and NDCG models. Using our approach, we manage to keep
most MRR state-of-the-art performance (70.41% vs. 71.24%) and the NDCG
state-of-the-art performance (72.16% vs. 75.35%). Moreover, our approach won

novel view synthesis of complex scenes. In our approach, a 3D scene is
represented as a light field, i.e., a set of rays, each of which has a
corresponding color when reaching the image plane. For efficient novel view
rendering, we adopt a 4D parameterization of the light field, where each ray is
characterized by a 4D parameter. We then formulate the light field as a 4D
function that maps 4D coordinates to corresponding color values. We train a
deep fully connected network to optimize this implicit function and memorize
the 3D scene. Then, the scene-specific model is used to synthesize novel views.
Different from previous light field approaches which require dense view
sampling to reliably render novel views, our method can render novel views by
sampling rays and querying the color for each ray from the network directly,
thus enabling high-quality light field rendering with a sparser set of training

given image category labels but requires to learn object localization models.
Optimizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification tends to
activate local discriminative regions while ignoring complete object extent,
causing the partial activation issue. In this paper, we argue that partial
activation is caused by the intrinsic characteristics of CNN, where the
convolution operations produce local receptive fields and experience difficulty
to capture long-range feature dependency among pixels. We introduce the token
semantic coupled attention map (TS-CAM) to take full advantage of the
self-attention mechanism in visual transformer for long-range dependency
extraction. TS-CAM first splits an image into a sequence of patch tokens for
spatial embedding, which produce attention maps of long-range visual dependency
to avoid partial activation. TS-CAM then re-allocates category-related
semantics for patch tokens, enabling each of them to be aware of object
categories. TS-CAM finally couples the patch tokens with the semantic-agnostic
attention map to achieve semantic-aware localization. Experiments on the
ILSVRC/CUB-200-2011 datasets show that TS-CAM outperforms its CNN-CAM
counterparts by 7.1%/27.1% for WSOL, achieving state-of-the-art performance.]]></summary>

and regression tasks on chest X-rays. In order to establish trust in the
clinical routine, the networks' prediction mechanism needs to be interpretable.
One principal approach to interpretation is feature attribution. Feature
attribution methods identify the importance of input features for the output
prediction. Building on Information Bottleneck Attribution (IBA) method, for
each prediction we identify the chest X-ray regions that have high mutual
information with the network's output. Original IBA identifies input regions
that have sufficient predictive information. We propose Inverse IBA to identify
all informative regions. Thus all predictive cues for pathologies are
highlighted on the X-rays, a desirable property for chest X-ray diagnosis.
Moreover, we propose Regression IBA for explaining regression models. Using
Regression IBA we observe that a model trained on cumulative severity score
labels implicitly learns the severity of different X-ray regions. Finally, we
propose Multi-layer IBA to generate higher resolution and more detailed
attribution/saliency maps. We evaluate our methods using both human-centric

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One widely used approach towards understanding the inner workings of deep
convolutional neural networks is to visualize unit responses via activation
maximization. Feature visualizations via activation maximization are thought to
provide humans with precise information about the image features that cause a
unit to be activated. If this is indeed true, these synthetic images should
enable humans to predict the effect of an intervention, such as whether
occluding a certain patch of the image (say, a dog's head) changes a unit's
activation. Here, we test this hypothesis by asking humans to predict which of
two square occlusions causes a larger change to a unit's activation. Both a
large-scale crowdsourced experiment and measurements with experts show that on
average, the extremely activating feature visualizations by Olah et al. (2017)
indeed help humans on this task ($67 \pm 4\%$ accuracy; baseline performance
without any visualizations is $60 \pm 3\%$). However, they do not provide any
significant advantage over other visualizations (such as e.g. dataset samples),
which yield similar performance ($66 \pm 3\%$ to $67 \pm 3\%$ accuracy). Taken
together, we propose an objective psychophysical task to quantify the benefit
of unit-level interpretability methods for humans, and find no evidence that
feature visualizations provide humans with better "causal understanding" than
simple alternative visualizations.]]></summary>

3D point cloud based place recognition has aroused significant research
interest due to its robustness to changing environments with drastic daytime
and weather variance. However, it is time-consuming and effort-costly to obtain
high-quality point cloud data for place recognition model training and ground
truth for registration in the real world. To this end, a novel
registration-aided 3D domain adaptation network for point cloud based place
recognition is proposed. A structure-aware registration network is introduced
to help to learn features with geometric information and a 6-DoFs pose between
two point clouds with partial overlap can be estimated. The model is trained
through a synthetic virtual LiDAR dataset through GTA-V with diverse weather
and daytime conditions and domain adaptation is implemented to the real-world
domain by aligning the global features. Our results outperform state-of-the-art
3D place recognition baselines or achieve comparable on the real-world Oxford
RobotCar dataset with the visualization of registration on the virtual dataset.]]></summary>

supervision. Yet contrastive learning is susceptible to shortcuts -- i.e., it
may learn shortcut features irrelevant to the downstream task and discard
relevant information. Past work has addressed this limitation via handcrafted
data augmentations that eliminate the shortcut. However, handcrafted
augmentations are infeasible for data modalities that are not interpretable by
humans (e.g., radio signals). Further, even when the modality is interpretable
(e.g., RGB), sometimes eliminating the shortcut information may be undesirable.
For example, in multi-attribute classification, information related to one
attribute may act as a shortcut around other attributes. This paper presents
reconstructive contrastive learning (RCL), a framework for learning
unsupervised representations that are robust to shortcuts. The key idea is to
force the learned representation to reconstruct the input, which naturally
counters potential shortcuts. Extensive experiments verify that RCL is highly
robust to shortcuts and outperforms state-of-the-art contrastive learning
methods on both RGB and RF datasets for a variety of tasks.]]></summary>

source model degrades when bumping into the high data density near decision
boundary in target domain. A common solution is to minimize the Shannon Entropy
to push the decision boundary away from the high density area. However, entropy
minimization also leads to severe reduction of prediction diversity, and
unfortunately brings harm to the domain adaptation. In this paper, we
investigate the prediction discriminability and diversity by studying the
structure of the classification output matrix of a randomly selected data
batch. We find by theoretical analysis that the prediction discriminability and
diversity could be separately measured by the Frobenius-norm and rank of the
batch output matrix. The nuclear-norm is an upperbound of the former, and a
convex approximation of the latter. Accordingly, we propose Batch Nuclear-norm
Maximization and Minimization, which performs nuclear-norm maximization on the
target output matrix to enhance the target prediction ability, and nuclear-norm
minimization on the source batch output matrix to increase applicability of the
source domain knowledge. We further approximate the nuclear-norm by
L_{1,2}-norm, and design multi-batch optimization for stable solution on large
number of categories. The fast approximation method achieves O(n^2)
computational complexity and better convergence property. Experiments show that
our method could boost the adaptation accuracy and robustness under three
typical domain adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

bounding boxes from 1.1K person identities, collected and constructed over 12
months. Unique characteristics of this dataset include: (1) Natural/native
personal appearance (e.g., clothes and hair style) variations: The
clothes-change and dressing styles all are highly diverse, with the reappearing
gap in time ranging from minutes, hours, and days to weeks, months, seasons,

professions appear in different weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, windy,
rainy, snowy, extremely cold) and events (e.g., working, leisure, daily
activities). (3) Rich camera setups: The raw videos were recorded by 17 outdoor
security cameras with various resolutions operating in a real-world
surveillance system for a wide and dense block. (4) Largest scale: It covers
the largest number of (17) cameras, (1, 121) identities, and (178, 407)

multi-scale learning, where the high-level and low-level features collaborate
in locating salient objects and discovering fine details, respectively.
However, most efforts are devoted to low-level feature learning by fusing
multi-scale features or enhancing boundary representations. High-level
features, which although have long proven effective for many other tasks, yet
have been barely studied for SOD. In this paper, we tap into this gap and show
that enhancing high-level features is essential for SOD as well. To this end,
we introduce an Extremely-Downsampled Network (EDN), which employs an extreme
downsampling technique to effectively learn a global view of the whole image,
leading to accurate salient object localization. To accomplish better
multi-level feature fusion, we construct the Scale-Correlated Pyramid
Convolution (SCPC) to build an elegant decoder for recovering object details
from the above extreme downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDN
achieves state-of-the-art performance with real-time speed. Our efficient
EDN-Lite also achieves competitive performance with a speed of 316fps. Hence,
this work is expected to spark some new thinking in SOD. Full training and

of thoracic pathologies on chest x-rays. Their black-box nature has sparked
many recent works to explain the prediction via input feature attribution
methods (aka saliency methods). However, input feature attribution methods
merely identify the importance of input regions for the prediction and lack
semantic interpretation of model behavior. In this work, we first identify the
semantics associated with internal units (feature maps) of the network. We
proceed to investigate the following questions; Does a regression model that is
only trained with COVID-19 severity scores implicitly learn visual patterns
associated with thoracic pathologies? Does a network that is trained on weakly
labeled data (e.g. healthy, unhealthy) implicitly learn pathologies? Moreover,
we investigate the effect of pretraining and data imbalance on the
interpretability of learned features. In addition to the analysis, we propose
semantic attribution to semantically explain each prediction. We present our
findings using publicly available chest pathologies (CheXpert, NIH ChestX-ray8)
and COVID-19 datasets (BrixIA, and COVID-19 chest X-ray segmentation dataset).

sea level rise or glacial retreat. Several Lake Ice Phenological (LIP) events
serve as sentinels to understand the regional and global climate change. Hence,
it is useful to monitor long-term lake freezing and thawing patterns. In this
paper we report a case study for the Oberengadin region of Switzerland, where
there are several small- and medium-sized mountain lakes. We observe the LIP
events, such as freeze-up, break-up and ice cover duration, across two decades
(2000-2020) from optical satellite images. We analyse time-series of MODIS
imagery by estimating spatially resolved maps of lake ice for these Alpine
lakes with supervised machine learning (and additionally cross-check with VIIRS
data when available). To train the classifier we rely on reference data
annotated manually based on webcam images. From the ice maps we derive
long-term LIP trends. Since the webcam data is only available for two winters,
we also validate our results against the operational MODIS and VIIRS snow
products. We find a change in complete freeze duration of -0.76 and -0.89 days
per annum for lakes Sils and Silvaplana, respectively. Furthermore, we observe
plausible correlations of the LIP trends with climate data measured at nearby
meteorological stations. We notice that mean winter air temperature has
negative correlation with the freeze duration and break-up events, and positive
correlation with the freeze-up events. Additionally, we observe strong negative
correlation of sunshine during the winter months with the freeze duration and
break-up events.]]></summary>

which are hard to attack in a black-box manner, because of their
multiple-output characteristics and the diversity across architectures. To
pursue a high attack transferability, one plausible way is to find a common
property across detectors, which facilitates the discovery of common
weaknesses. We are the first to suggest that the relevance map from
interpreters for detectors is such a property. Based on it, we design a
Relevance Attack on Detectors (RAD), which achieves a state-of-the-art
transferability, exceeding existing results by above 20%. On MS COCO, the
detection mAPs for all 8 black-box architectures are more than halved and the

transferability of RAD, we generate the first adversarial dataset for object
detection and instance segmentation, i.e., Adversarial Objects in COntext

features from unlabeled videos. However, most recent works have mainly focused
on high-level semantics and neglected lower-level representations and their
temporal relationship which are crucial for general video understanding. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-level feature
optimization framework to improve the generalization and temporal modeling
ability of learned video representations. Concretely, high-level features
obtained from naive and prototypical contrastive learning are utilized to build
distribution graphs, guiding the process of low-level and mid-level feature
learning. We also devise a simple temporal modeling module from multi-level
features to enhance motion pattern learning. Experiments demonstrate that
multi-level feature optimization with the graph constraint and temporal
modeling can greatly improve the representation ability in video understanding.]]></summary>

autonomous vehicles, most of which highly dependent on Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs). Recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to
adversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed to understand and
generate adversarial examples, such as gradient based attack, score based
attack, decision based attack, and transfer based attacks. However, most of
these algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because (1)
iteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast
moving car and (2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally
without considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems,
this paper proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real world
road sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: (1)
we leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip
those zero-contributed areas - this also helps to generate natural
perturbations, (2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a
single perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance
of the pre-trained attention map, (3) we design a simple objective function
that can be easily optimized, (4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real
world data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the
attack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a
quarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also
provides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability.
We provide code and data to ensure the reproducibility:

explaining decisions made by artificial intelligence systems is becoming a more
and more important topic. Especially for image classification tasks, many
state-of-the-art tools to explain such classifiers rely on visual highlighting
of important areas of the input data. Contrary, counterfactual explanation
systems try to enable a counterfactual reasoning by modifying the input image
in a way such that the classifier would have made a different prediction. By
doing so, the users of counterfactual explanation systems are equipped with a
completely different kind of explanatory information. However, methods for
generating realistic counterfactual explanations for image classifiers are
still rare. Especially in medical contexts, where relevant information often
consists of textural and structural information, high-quality counterfactual
images have the potential to give meaningful insights into decision processes.
In this work, we present GANterfactual, an approach to generate such
counterfactual image explanations based on adversarial image-to-image
translation techniques. Additionally, we conduct a user study to evaluate our
approach in an exemplary medical use case. Our results show that, in the chosen
medical use-case, counterfactual explanations lead to significantly better
results regarding mental models, explanation satisfaction, trust, emotions, and
self-efficacy than two state-of-the-art systems that work with saliency maps,

high-quality videos from low-quality compressed ones. Among them, some restore
the missing details of each frame via exploring the spatiotemporal information

temporal scope, thus may miss some useful details from some frames outside the

propose a Recursive Fusion (RF) module to model the temporal dependency within
a long temporal range. Specifically, RF utilizes both the current reference
frames and the preceding hidden state to conduct better spatiotemporal
compensation. On the other hand, we design an efficient and effective
Deformable Spatiotemporal Attention (DSTA) module such that the model can pay
more effort on restoring the artifact-rich areas like the boundary area of a
moving object. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the
existing ones on the MFQE 2.0 dataset in terms of both fidelity and perceptual

image denoising based on pixel-wise classification. Despite using a
computationally efficient network cannot effectively remove the noises from any

use an efficient U-net to pixel-wisely classify pixels in the noisy image based
on the local gradient statistics. Then we replace part of the convolution
layers in existing denoising networks by the proposed Class Specific

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In semantic segmentation tasks, input images can often have more than one
plausible interpretation, thus allowing for multiple valid labels. To capture
such ambiguities, recent work has explored the use of probabilistic networks
that can learn a distribution over predictions. However, these do not
necessarily represent the empirical distribution accurately. In this work, we
present a strategy for learning a calibrated predictive distribution over
semantic maps, where the probability associated with each prediction reflects
its ground truth correctness likelihood. To this end, we propose a novel
two-stage, cascaded approach for calibrated adversarial refinement: (i) a
standard segmentation network is trained with categorical cross entropy to
predict a pixelwise probability distribution over semantic classes and (ii) an
adversarially trained stochastic network is used to model the inter-pixel
correlations to refine the output of the first network into coherent samples.
Importantly, to calibrate the refinement network and prevent mode collapse, the
expectation of the samples in the second stage is matched to the probabilities
predicted in the first. We demonstrate the versatility and robustness of the
approach by achieving state-of-the-art results on the multigrader LIDC dataset
and on a modified Cityscapes dataset with injected ambiguities. In addition, we
show that the core design can be adapted to other tasks requiring learning a
calibrated predictive distribution by experimenting on a toy regression
dataset. We provide an open source implementation of our method at

essential, as it is often connected to vital decision-making. Compelling
attempts have been made in quantifying the uncertainty in image segmentation
architectures, e.g. to learn a density segmentation model conditioned on the
input image. Typical work in this field restricts these learnt densities to be
strictly Gaussian. In this paper, we propose to use a more flexible approach by
introducing Normalizing Flows (NFs), which enables the learnt densities to be
more complex and facilitate more accurate modeling for uncertainty. We prove
this hypothesis by adopting the Probabilistic U-Net and augmenting the
posterior density with an NF, allowing it to be more expressive. Our
qualitative as well as quantitative (GED and IoU) evaluations on the
multi-annotated and single-annotated LIDC-IDRI and Kvasir-SEG segmentation
datasets, respectively, show a clear improvement. This is mostly apparent in
the quantification of aleatoric uncertainty and the increased predictive
performance of up to 14 percent. This result strongly indicates that a more
flexible density model should be seriously considered in architectures that
attempt to capture segmentation ambiguity through density modeling. The benefit
of this improved modeling will increase human confidence in annotation and
segmentation, and enable eager adoption of the technology in practice.]]></summary>

threat model for cyber-physical vision systems. In this setting, the attacker
only has query access to the model and only receives the top-1 class label
without confidence information. Creating small physical stickers that are
robust to environmental variation is difficult in the discrete and
discontinuous hard-label space because the attack must both design a small
shape to perturb within and find robust noise to fill it with. Unfortunately,
we find that existing $\ell_2$ or $\ell_\infty$ minimizing hard-label attacks
do not easily extend to finding such robust physical perturbation attacks.
Thus, we propose GRAPHITE, the first algorithm for hard-label physical attacks
on computer vision models. We show that "survivability", an estimate of
physical variation robustness, can be used in new ways to generate small masks
and is a sufficiently smooth function to optimize with gradient-free
optimization. We use GRAPHITE to attack a traffic sign classifier and a
publicly-available Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) tool using only
query access. We evaluate both tools in real-world field tests to measure its
physical-world robustness. We successfully cause a Stop sign to be
misclassified as a Speed Limit 30 km/hr sign in 95.7% of physical images and

on incorrect classes. This work discovers that neutralizing predicted
probabilities on incorrect classes improves the prediction accuracy for
imbalanced image classification. This paper proposes a simple but effective
loss named complement cross entropy based on this finding. The proposed loss
makes the ground truth class overwhelm the other classes in terms of softmax
probability, by neutralizing probabilities of incorrect classes, without
additional training procedures. Along with it, this loss facilitates the models
to learn key information especially from samples on minority classes. It
ensures more accurate and robust classification results on imbalanced
distributions. Extensive experiments on imbalanced datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.]]></summary>

such as pixel discretization are appealing due to their simplicity but have so
far been shown to be ineffective except on simple datasets such as MNIST,
leading to the belief that pixel discretization approaches are doomed to
failure as a defense technique. This paper revisits the pixel discretization
approaches. We hypothesize that the reason why existing approaches have failed
is that they have used a fixed codebook for the entire dataset. In particular,
we find that can lead to situations where images become more susceptible to
adversarial perturbations and also suffer significant loss of accuracy after
discretization. We propose a novel image preprocessing technique called
Essential Features that uses an adaptive codebook that is based on per-image
content and threat model. Essential Features adaptively selects a separable set
of color clusters for each image to reduce the color space while preserving the
pertinent features of the original image, maximizing both separability and
representation of colors. Additionally, to limit the adversary's ability to
influence the chosen color clusters, Essential Features takes advantage of
spatial correlation with an adaptive blur that moves pixels closer to their
original value without destroying original edge information. We design several
adaptive attacks and find that our approach is more robust than previous
baselines on $L_\infty$ and $L_2$ bounded attacks for several challenging
datasets including CIFAR-10, GTSRB, RESISC45, and ImageNet.]]></summary>

designing our learning strategy, we consider the spectrum as a natural and
ready to use representation to encode variability of the shapes. Therefore, we
propose a simple decoder-only architecture that directly maps spectra to 3D
embeddings; in particular, we combine information from global and local
spectra, the latter being obtained from localized variants of the manifold
Laplacian. This combination captures the relations between the full shape and
its local parts, leading to more accurate generation of geometric details and
an improved semantic control in shape synthesis and novel editing applications.

middle level and global level point features produced in the backbone network.
This point discrimination loss enforces the features to be consistent with
points belonging to the shape surface and inconsistent with randomly sampled
noisy points. Our method is simple in design, which works by adding an extra
adaptation module and a point consistency module for unsupervised training of
the encoder in the backbone network. Once trained, these two modules can be
discarded during supervised training of the classifier or decoder for
down-stream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on 3D object
classification, 3D part segmentation and shape reconstruction in various
unsupervised and transfer settings. Both quantitative and qualitative results
show that our method learns powerful representations and achieves new

call for a diverse range of visual perception abilities. For example, to "go to
the nearest chair", the agent might need to identify a chair in a living room

obstacles using depth. Therefore, utilizing the appropriate visual perception
abilities based on a situational understanding of the visual environment can
empower these navigation models in unseen visual environments. We propose to
train an agent to fuse a large set of visual representations that correspond to
diverse visual perception abilities. To fully utilize each representation, we
develop an action-level representation fusion scheme, which predicts an action
candidate from each representation and adaptively consolidate these action
candidates into the final action. Furthermore, we employ a data-driven
inter-task affinity regularization to reduce redundancies and improve

highlight important image attention vectors with an Image-Sentence Attention

introduce an adaptive prior. The obtained results improve the METEOR score on

task. Under nearly lightless condition, existing image denoising methods could
easily break down due to significantly low SNR. In this paper, we
systematically study the noise statistics in the imaging pipeline of CMOS
photosensors, and formulate a comprehensive noise model that can accurately
characterize the real noise structures. Our novel model considers the noise
sources caused by digital camera electronics which are largely overlooked by
existing methods yet have significant influence on raw measurement in the dark.
It provides a way to decouple the intricate noise structure into different
statistical distributions with physical interpretations. Moreover, our noise
model can be used to synthesize realistic training data for learning-based
low-light denoising algorithms. In this regard, although promising results have
been shown recently with deep convolutional neural networks, the success
heavily depends on abundant noisy clean image pairs for training, which are
tremendously difficult to obtain in practice. Generalizing their trained models
to images from new devices is also problematic. Extensive experiments on
multiple low-light denoising datasets -- including a newly collected one in
this work covering various devices -- show that a deep neural network trained
with our proposed noise formation model can reach surprisingly-high accuracy.
The results are on par with or sometimes even outperform training with paired

consider weak labels in the form of pseudo-labels and propose a semi-weakly

labels, we generate a patch-level dataset for pretraining and formulate a
multi-label contrastive learning objective to capture position-specific

performance of SWCL on seven public retinal fundus datasets, covering three
disease classification tasks and two anatomical structure segmentation tasks.
Our experiment results suggest that, under very low data regime, large-scale
ImageNet pretraining on improved architecture remains a very strong baseline,

events in natural language. To apply it to real-time monitoring, a system needs
not only to describe events accurately but also to produce the captions as soon
as possible. Low-latency captioning is needed to realize such functionality,
but this research area for online video captioning has not been pursued yet.
This paper proposes a novel approach to optimize each caption's output timing
based on a trade-off between latency and caption quality. An audio-visual
Trans-former is trained to generate ground-truth captions using only a small
portion of all video frames, and to mimic outputs of a pre-trained Transformer
to which all the frames are given. A CNN-based timing detector is also trained
to detect a proper output timing, where the captions generated by the two
Trans-formers become sufficiently close to each other. With the jointly trained
Transformer and timing detector, a caption can be generated in the early stages
of an event-triggered video clip, as soon as an event happens or when it can be
forecasted. Experiments with the ActivityNet Captions dataset show that our
approach achieves 94% of the caption quality of the upper bound given by the
pre-trained Transformer using the entire video clips, using only 28% of frames
from the beginning.]]></summary>

different text information. Current text-aware image captioning models are not
able to generate distinctive captions according to various information needs.
To explore how to generate personalized text-aware captions, we define a new
challenging task, namely Question-controlled Text-aware Image Captioning
(Qc-TextCap). With questions as control signals, this task requires models to
understand questions, find related scene texts and describe them together with
objects fluently in human language. Based on two existing text-aware captioning
datasets, we automatically construct two datasets, ControlTextCaps and
ControlVizWiz to support the task. We propose a novel Geometry and Question
Aware Model (GQAM). GQAM first applies a Geometry-informed Visual Encoder to
fuse region-level object features and region-level scene text features with
considering spatial relationships. Then, we design a Question-guided Encoder to
select the most relevant visual features for each question. Finally, GQAM
generates a personalized text-aware caption with a Multimodal Decoder. Our
model achieves better captioning performance and question answering ability
than carefully designed baselines on both two datasets. With questions as
control signals, our model generates more informative and diverse captions than
the state-of-the-art text-aware captioning model. Our code and datasets are

classification where an image contains multiple labels. Not only acquiring a
clean and fully labeled dataset in multi-label learning is extremely expensive,
but also many of the actual labels are corrupted or missing due to the
automated or non-expert annotation techniques. Noisy label data decrease the
prediction performance drastically. In this paper, we propose a novel Gold
Asymmetric Loss Correction with Single-Label Regulators (GALC-SLR) that
operates robust against noisy labels. GALC-SLR estimates the noise confusion
matrix using single-label samples, then constructs an asymmetric loss
correction via estimated confusion matrix to avoid overfitting to the noisy
labels. Empirical results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
original asymmetric loss multi-label classifier under all corruption levels,
showing mean average precision improvement up to 28.67% on a real world dataset
of MS-COCO, yielding a better generalization of the unseen data and increased

variability and low sample sizes that limit the effectiveness of deep learning
algorithms. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) with the ability
to synthesize realist images have shown great potential as an alternative to
standard data augmentation techniques. Our work focuses on cross-modality
synthesis of fluorodeoxyglucose~(FDG) Positron Emission Tomography~(PET) scans
from structural Magnetic Resonance~(MR) images using generative models to
facilitate multi-modal diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, we
propose a novel end-to-end, globally and locally aware image-to-image
translation GAN (GLA-GAN) with a multi-path architecture that enforces both
global structural integrity and fidelity to local details. We further
supplement the standard adversarial loss with voxel-level intensity,
multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) and region-of-interest (ROI) based
loss components that reduce reconstruction error, enforce structural
consistency at different scales and perceive variation in regional sensitivity
to AD respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our GLA-GAN not only
generates synthesized FDG-PET scans with enhanced image quality but also
superior clinical utility in improving AD diagnosis compared to
state-of-the-art models. Finally, we attempt to interpret some of the internal
units of the GAN that are closely related to this specific cross-modality

computational resources for accurate predictions. One promising technique to
obtain an accurate yet lightweight pose estimator is knowledge distillation,
which distills the pose knowledge from a powerful teacher model to a
less-parameterized student model. However, existing pose distillation works
rely on a heavy pre-trained estimator to perform knowledge transfer and require
a complex two-stage learning procedure. In this work, we investigate a novel
Online Knowledge Distillation framework by distilling Human Pose structure
knowledge in a one-stage manner to guarantee the distillation efficiency,
termed OKDHP. Specifically, OKDHP trains a single multi-branch network and
acquires the predicted heatmaps from each, which are then assembled by a
Feature Aggregation Unit (FAU) as the target heatmaps to teach each branch in
reverse. Instead of simply averaging the heatmaps, FAU which consists of
multiple parallel transformations with different receptive fields, leverages
the multi-scale information, thus obtains target heatmaps with higher-quality.
Specifically, the pixel-wise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is utilized to
minimize the discrepancy between the target heatmaps and the predicted ones,
which enables the student network to learn the implicit keypoint relationship.
Besides, an unbalanced OKDHP scheme is introduced to customize the student
networks with different compression rates. The effectiveness of our approach is
demonstrated by extensive experiments on two common benchmark datasets, MPII
and COCO.]]></summary>

systems: there is indeed inconsistency between training and testing.
Constructing a high-quality co-saliency detection dataset involves
time-consuming and labor-intensive pixel-level labeling, which has forced most
recent works to rely instead on semantic segmentation or saliency detection
datasets for training. However, the lack of proper co-saliency and the absence
of multiple foreground objects in these datasets can lead to spurious
variations and inherent biases learned by models. To tackle this, we introduce
the idea of counterfactual training through context adjustment, and propose a
"cost-free" group-cut-paste (GCP) procedure to leverage images from
off-the-shelf saliency detection datasets and synthesize new samples. Following
GCP, we collect a novel dataset called Context Adjustment Training. The two
variants of our dataset, i.e., CAT and CAT+, consist of 16,750 and 33,500
images, respectively. All images are automatically annotated with high-quality
masks. As a side-product, object categories, as well as edge information, are
also provided to facilitate other related works. Extensive experiments with
state-of-the-art models are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our
dataset. We hope that the scale, diversity, and quality of CAT/CAT+ can benefit

challenges the problem of separating the whole-home electricity usage into
appliance-specific individual consumptions, which is a typical application of
data analysis. {NILM aims to help households understand how the energy is used
and consequently tell them how to effectively manage the energy, thus allowing
energy efficiency which is considered as one of the twin pillars of sustainable
energy policy (i.e., energy efficiency and renewable energy).} Although NILM is
unidentifiable, it is widely believed that the NILM problem can be addressed by
data science. Most of the existing approaches address the energy disaggregation
problem by conventional techniques such as sparse coding, non-negative matrix
factorization, and hidden Markov model. Recent advances reveal that deep neural
networks (DNNs) can get favorable performance for NILM since DNNs can
inherently learn the discriminative signatures of the different appliances. In
this paper, we propose a novel method named adversarial energy disaggregation
(AED) based on DNNs. We introduce the idea of adversarial learning into NILM,
which is new for the energy disaggregation task. Our method trains a generator
and multiple discriminators via an adversarial fashion. The proposed method not
only learns shard representations for different appliances, but captures the

types of regions. DLA plays an important role in the document content
understanding and information extraction systems. Exploring a method that can
use less data for effective training contributes to the development of DLA. We
consider a Human-in-the-loop (HITL) collaborative intelligence in the DLA. Our
approach was inspired by the fact that the HITL push the model to learn from
the unknown problems by adding a small amount of data based on knowledge. The
HITL select key samples by using confidence. However, using confidence to find
key samples is not suitable for DLA tasks. We propose the Key Samples Selection
(KSS) method to find key samples in high-level tasks (semantic segmentation)
more accurately through agent collaboration, effectively reducing costs. Once
selected, these key samples are passed to human beings for active labeling,
then the model will be updated with the labeled samples. Hence, we revisited
the learning system from reinforcement learning and designed a sample-based
agent update strategy, which effectively improves the agent's ability to accept
new samples. It achieves significant improvement results in two benchmarks
(DSSE-200 (from 77.1% to 86.3%) and CS-150 (from 88.0% to 95.6%)) by using 10%
of labeled data.]]></summary>

video has acquired promising results and drawn extensive attention. Most
existing methods jointly train the depth and pose networks by photometric
consistency of adjacent frames based on the principle of structure-from-motion
(SFM). However, the coupling relationship of the depth and pose networks
seriously influences the learning performance, and the re-projection relations
is sensitive to scale ambiguity, especially for pose learning. In this paper,
we aim to improve the depth-pose learning performance without the auxiliary
tasks and address the above issues by alternative training each task and
incorporating the epipolar geometric constraints into the Iterative Closest
Point (ICP) based point clouds match process. Distinct from jointly training
the depth and pose networks, our key idea is to better utilize the mutual
dependency of these two tasks by alternatively training each network with
respective losses while fixing the other. We also design a log-scale 3D
structural consistency loss to put more emphasis on the smaller depth values
during training. To makes the optimization easier, we further incorporate the
epipolar geometry into the ICP based learning process for pose learning.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks datasets indicate the superiority
of our algorithm over the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods.]]></summary>

vitality into salient object detection (SOD), and a mass of RGB-D SOD
algorithms have been proposed, mainly concentrating on how to better integrate
cross-modality features from RGB image and depth map. For the cross-modality
interaction in feature encoder, existing methods either indiscriminately treat
RGB and depth modalities, or only habitually utilize depth cues as auxiliary
information of the RGB branch. Different from them, we reconsider the status of
two modalities and propose a novel Cross-modality Discrepant Interaction
Network (CDINet) for RGB-D SOD, which differentially models the dependence of
two modalities according to the feature representations of different layers. To
this end, two components are designed to implement the effective cross-modality

modality to enhance the details of the depth features in low-level encoder
stage. 2) the Depth-induced Semantic Enhancement (DSE) module transfers the
object positioning and internal consistency of depth features to the RGB branch
in high-level encoder stage. Furthermore, we also design a Dense Decoding

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video anomaly detection (VAD) has constantly been a vital topic in video
analysis. As anomalies are often rare, it is typically addressed under a
semi-supervised setup, which requires a training set with pure normal videos.
To avoid exhausted manual labeling, we are inspired by how humans sense
anomalies and propose a hominine framework that enables both unsupervised and
end-to-end VAD. The framework is based on two key observations: 1) Human
perception is usually local, i.e. focusing on local foreground and its context
when sensing anomalies. Thus, we propose to impose locality-awareness by
localizing foreground with generic knowledge, and a region localization
strategy is designed to exploit local context. 2) Frequently-occurred events
will mould humans' definition of normality, which motivates us to devise a
surrogate training paradigm. It trains a deep neural network (DNN) to learn a
surrogate task with unlabeled videos, and frequently-occurred events will play
a dominant role in "moulding" the DNN. In this way, a training loss gap will
automatically manifest rarely-seen novel events as anomalies. For
implementation, we explore various surrogate tasks as well as both classic and
emerging DNN models. Extensive evaluations on commonly-used VAD benchmarks
justify the framework's applicability to different surrogate tasks or DNN
models, and demonstrate its astonishing effectiveness: It not only outperforms
existing unsupervised solutions by a wide margin (8% to 10% AUROC gain), but
also achieves comparable or even superior performance to state-of-the-art
semi-supervised counterparts.]]></summary>

on both global silhouette and local details of pedestrian. To extract such more
representative features, an effective way is to exploit deep models with
multiple branches. However, most multi-branch based methods implemented by
duplication of part backbone structure normally lead to severe increase of
computational cost. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Feature Pyramid
Branch (FPB) to extract features from different layers of networks and
aggregate them in a bidirectional pyramid structure. Cooperated by attention
modules and our proposed cross orthogonality regularization, FPB significantly
prompts the performance of backbone network by only introducing less than 1.5M
extra parameters. Extensive experimental results on standard benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our proposed FPB based model outperforms state-of-the-art
methods with obvious margin as well as much less model complexity. FPB borrows
the idea of the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) from prevailing object detection
methods. To our best knowledge, it is the first successful application of
similar structure in person Re-ID tasks, which empirically proves that pyramid
network as affiliated branch could be a potential structure in related feature
embedding models. The source code is publicly available at

classification is of crucial importance to address this environmental

recognition performance using novel approaches, others concentrate on
computational optimization for their framework. In addition, a few studies are
diving into feature extraction to gain significantly in terms of accuracy. In
this paper, we propose an effective method for the leaf recognition problem. In

refined color image, vein image, xy-projection histogram, handcrafted shape,
texture features, and Fourier descriptors. These attributes are then
transformed into a better representation by neural network-based encoders
before a support vector machine (SVM) model is utilized to classify different
leaves. Overall, our approach performs a state-of-the-art result on the Flavia

fields such as computer vision, computational biology and chemistry, where data
are naturally explained by graphs. However, unlike traditional convolutional

over-smoothing phenomenon. In this work, we propose a family of architectures
to control this behavior by design. Our networks are motivated by numerical
methods for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) on manifolds, and as
such, their behavior can be explained by similar analysis. Moreover, as we
demonstrate using an extensive set of experiments, our PDE-motivated networks
can generalize and be effective for various types of problems from different

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Existing video copy detection methods generally measure video similarity
based on spatial similarities between key frames, neglecting the latent
similarity in temporal dimension, so that the video similarity is biased
towards spatial information. There are methods modeling unified video
similarity in an end-to-end way, but losing detailed partial alignment
information, which causes the incapability of copy segments localization. To
address the above issues, we propose the Video Similarity and Alignment
Learning (VSAL) approach, which jointly models spatial similarity, temporal
similarity and partial alignment. To mitigate the spatial similarity bias, we
model the temporal similarity as the mask map predicted from frame-level
spatial similarity, where each element indicates the probability of frame pair
lying right on the partial alignments. To further localize partial copies, the
step map is learned from the spatial similarity where the elements indicate
extending directions of the current partial alignments on the spatial-temporal
similarity map. Obtained from the mask map, the start points extend out into
partial optimal alignments following instructions of the step map. With the
similarity and alignment learning strategy, VSAL achieves the state-of-the-art
F1-score on VCDB core dataset. Furthermore, we construct a new benchmark of
partial video copy detection and localization by adding new segment-level
annotations for FIVR-200k dataset, where VSAL also achieves the best
performance, verifying its effectiveness in more challenging situations. Our

the downstream tasks, e.g., image classification in computer vision. However,
extensive experiments have shown that, prominent neural architectures, such as
ResNet in computer vision and LSTM in natural language processing, are
generally good at extracting patterns from the input data and perform well on
different downstream tasks. These observations inspire us to ask: Is it
necessary to use the performance of specific downstream tasks to evaluate and
search for good neural architectures? Can we perform NAS effectively and
efficiently while being agnostic to the downstream task? In this work, we
attempt to affirmatively answer the above two questions and improve the
state-of-the-art NAS solution by proposing a novel and generic NAS framework,
termed Generic NAS (GenNAS). GenNAS does not use task-specific labels but
instead adopts \textit{regression} on a set of manually designed synthetic
signal bases for architecture evaluation. Such a self-supervised regression
task can effectively evaluate the intrinsic power of an architecture to capture
and transform the input signal patterns, and allow more sufficient usage of
training samples. We then propose an automatic task search to optimize the
combination of synthetic signals using limited downstream-task-specific labels,
further improving the performance of GenNAS. We also thoroughly evaluate
GenNAS's generality and end-to-end NAS performance on all search spaces, which
outperforms almost all existing works with significant speedup.]]></summary>

Inspired by word embedding techniques from natural language processing, we
propose neural agent architectures that enables them to communicate via

theoretic framework that our technique optimizes communication over a wide

assumptions. In self-play experiments, we validate that our trained agents
learn to cluster tokens in semantically-meaningful ways, allowing them
communicate in noisy environments where other techniques fail. Lastly, we
demonstrate both that agents using our method can effectively respond to novel

However, multimodal tweets are short and accompanied by complex, possibly

a promising approach for text classification. Particularly, previous studies
suggest that prompt-tuning has remarkable superiority in the low-data scenario

prompt-tuning is to insert text pieces, i.e., template, to the input and
transform a classification problem into a masked language modeling problem,
where a crucial step is to construct a projection, i.e., verbalizer, between a
label space and a label word space. A verbalizer is usually handcrafted or
searched by gradient descent, which may lack coverage and bring considerable
bias and high variances to the results. In this work, we focus on incorporating
external knowledge into the verbalizer, forming a knowledgeable prompt-tuning
(KPT), to improve and stabilize prompt-tuning. Specifically, we expand the
label word space of the verbalizer using external knowledge bases (KBs) and
refine the expanded label word space with the PLM itself before predicting with
the expanded label word space. Extensive experiments on zero and few-shot text

diagnosis, and treatment of various cardiovascular and ophthalmic diseases.
Recently, deep learning-based retinal vessel segmentation algorithms have
achieved remarkable performance. However, due to the domain shift problem, the
performance of these algorithms often degrades when they are applied to new
data that is different from the training data. Manually labeling new data for
each test domain is often a time-consuming and laborious task. In this work, we
explore unsupervised domain adaptation in retinal vessel segmentation by using
entropy-based adversarial learning and transfer normalization layer to train a
segmentation network, which generalizes well across domains and requires no
annotation of the target domain. Specifically, first, an entropy-based
adversarial learning strategy is developed to reduce the distribution
discrepancy between the source and target domains while also achieving the
objective of entropy minimization on the target domain. In addition, a new
transfer normalization layer is proposed to further boost the transferability
of the deep network. It normalizes the features of each domain separately to
compensate for the domain distribution gap. Besides, it also adaptively selects
those feature channels that are more transferable between domains, thus further
enhancing the generalization performance of the network. We conducted extensive
experiments on three regular fundus image datasets and an ultra-widefield
fundus image dataset, and the results show that our approach yields significant
performance gains compared to other state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

music recognition (OMR) on monophonic and homophonic music with high accuracy.
However, piano and orchestral scores frequently exhibit polyphonic passages,
which add a second dimension to the task. Monophonic and homophonic music can
be described as homorhythmic, or having a single musical rhythm. Polyphonic
music, on the other hand, can be seen as having multiple rhythmic sequences, or
voices, concurrently. We first introduce a workflow for creating large-scale
polyphonic datasets suitable for end-to-end recognition from sheet music
publicly available on the MuseScore forum. We then propose two novel
formulations for end-to-end polyphonic OMR -- one treating the problem as a
type of multi-task binary classification, and the other treating it as
multi-sequence detection. Building upon the encoder-decoder architecture and an
image encoder proposed in past work on end-to-end OMR, we propose two novel
decoder models -- FlagDecoder and RNNDecoder -- that correspond to the two
formulations. Finally, we compare the empirical performance of these end-to-end
approaches to polyphonic OMR and observe a new state-of-the-art performance
with our multi-sequence detection decoder, RNNDecoder.]]></summary>

supervision and fail to generate diverse solutions. In this paper, we address
this issue by introducing a \textit{weakly-supervised} paradigm for learning
MWPs. Our method only requires the annotations of the final answers and can
generate various solutions for a single problem. To boost weakly-supervised
learning, we propose a novel \textit{learning-by-fixing} (LBF) framework, which
corrects the misperceptions of the neural network via symbolic reasoning.
Specifically, for an incorrect solution tree generated by the neural network,
the \textit{fixing} mechanism propagates the error from the root node to the
leaf nodes and infers the most probable fix that can be executed to get the
desired answer. To generate more diverse solutions, \textit{tree
regularization} is applied to guide the efficient shrinkage and exploration of
the solution space, and a \textit{memory buffer} is designed to track and save
the discovered various fixes for each problem. Experimental results on the
Math23K dataset show the proposed LBF framework significantly outperforms
reinforcement learning baselines in weakly-supervised learning. Furthermore, it
achieves comparable top-1 and much better top-3/5 answer accuracies than
fully-supervised methods, demonstrating its strength in producing diverse

unsupervised mapping approaches that align monolingual embeddings. Such methods
critically rely on those embeddings having a similar structure, but it was
recently shown that the separate training in different languages causes
departures from this assumption. In this paper, we propose an alternative
approach that does not have this limitation, while requiring a weak seed
dictionary (e.g., a list of identical words) as the only form of supervision.
Rather than aligning two fixed embedding spaces, our method works by fixing the
target language embeddings, and learning a new set of embeddings for the source
language that are aligned with them. To that end, we use an extension of
skip-gram that leverages translated context words as anchor points, and
incorporates self-learning and iterative restarts to reduce the dependency on
the initial dictionary. Our approach outperforms conventional mapping methods
on bilingual lexicon induction, and obtains competitive results in the
downstream XNLI task.]]></summary>

interior design: an artist needs to observe the space, create a conceptual
design, build a 3D model, and perform rendering. In this paper, we introduce a

generate conceptual but realistic interior designs, bypassing the traditional
multi-step and time-consuming pipeline. Our attempt to neural scene decoration
in this paper is a generative adversarial neural network that takes the input
photograph and directly produce the image of the desired furnishing and
decorations. Our network contains a novel image generator that transforms an
initial point-based object layout into a realistic photograph. We demonstrate

(OIA). OIA models interactions between the sentence-corresponding image and
important regions in other images of the sequence. To highlight the important
objects, a message-passing-like algorithm collects representations of those
objects in an order-aware manner. To generate the story's sentences, we then
highlight important image attention vectors with an Image-Sentence Attention
(ISA). Further, to alleviate common linguistic mistakes like repetitiveness, we
introduce an adaptive prior. The obtained results improve the METEOR score on
the VIST dataset by 1%. In addition, an extensive human study verifies
coherency improvements and shows that OIA and ISA generated stories are more

stands for Transformer Encoder Representations from Alteration. Recent
approaches often learn by using a single auxiliary task like contrastive
prediction, autoregressive prediction, or masked reconstruction. Unlike
previous methods, we use alteration along three orthogonal axes to pre-train
Transformer Encoders on a large amount of unlabeled speech. The model learns
through the reconstruction of acoustic frames from their altered counterpart,
where we use a stochastic policy to alter along various dimensions: time,
frequency, and magnitude. TERA can be used for speech representations
extraction or fine-tuning with downstream models. We evaluate TERA on several
downstream tasks, including phoneme classification, keyword spotting, speaker
recognition, and speech recognition. We present a large-scale comparison of
various self-supervised models. TERA achieves strong performance in the
comparison by improving upon surface features and outperforming previous
models. In our experiments, we study the effect of applying different
alteration techniques, pre-training on more data, and pre-training on various
features. We analyze different model sizes and find that smaller models are
strong representation learners than larger models, while larger models are more
effective for downstream fine-tuning than smaller models. Furthermore, we show
the proposed method is transferable to downstream datasets not used in

a constraint interpreter that encodes textual constraints into spatial and

uses these representations to produce a policy achieving minimal constraint
violations during training. Across different domains in HazardWorld, we show
that our method achieves higher rewards (up to11x) and fewer constraint

processing tasks, such as activity recognition and motion tracking. Likewise, a
pose estimator for the illustrated character domain would provide a valuable
prior for assistive content creation tasks, such as reference pose retrieval
and automatic character animation. But while modern data-driven techniques have
substantially improved pose estimation performance on natural images, little
work has been done for illustrations. In our work, we bridge this domain gap by
efficiently transfer-learning from both domain-specific and task-specific
source models. Additionally, we upgrade and expand an existing illustrated pose
estimation dataset, and introduce two new datasets for classification and
segmentation subtasks. We then apply the resultant state-of-the-art character
pose estimator to solve the novel task of pose-guided illustration retrieval.
All data, models, and code will be made publicly available.]]></summary>

our "specialize and fuse" process for semantic segmentation. A pyramidal
"output" representation consists of coarse-to-fine levels, where each level is
"specialize" in a different class distribution (e.g., more stuff than things
classes at coarser levels). Two types of pyramidal outputs (i.e., unity and
semantic pyramid) are "fused" into the final semantic output, where the unity
pyramid indicates unity-cells (i.e., all pixels in such cell share the same
semantic label). The process ensures parsimony by predicting a relatively small
number of labels for unity-cells (e.g., a large cell of grass) to build the
final semantic output. In addition to the "output" representation, we design a
coarse-to-fine contextual module to aggregate the "features" representation
from different levels. We validate the effectiveness of each key module in our
method through comprehensive ablation studies. Finally, our approach achieves

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Transformers with powerful global relation modeling abilities have been
introduced to fundamental computer vision tasks recently. As a typical example,
the Vision Transformer (ViT) directly applies a pure transformer architecture
on image classification, by simply splitting images into tokens with a fixed
length, and employing transformers to learn relations between these tokens.
However, such naive tokenization could destruct object structures, assign grids
to uninterested regions such as background, and introduce interference signals.
To mitigate the above issues, in this paper, we propose an iterative and
progressive sampling strategy to locate discriminative regions. At each
iteration, embeddings of the current sampling step are fed into a transformer
encoder layer, and a group of sampling offsets is predicted to update the
sampling locations for the next step. The progressive sampling is
differentiable. When combined with the Vision Transformer, the obtained PS-ViT
network can adaptively learn where to look. The proposed PS-ViT is both
effective and efficient. When trained from scratch on ImageNet, PS-ViT performs
3.8% higher than the vanilla ViT in terms of top-1 accuracy with about
$4\times$ fewer parameters and $10\times$ fewer FLOPs. Code is available at

counterparts, in terms of \textit{accuracy,} \textit{model size}, \textit{and}

that is fundamental and highly generalizable. The proposed method reduces
redundancy and improves efficiency on top of the existing attention
optimizations. We show its drop-in applicability for both the regular attention
mechanism and some most recent variants in vision transformers. As a result, we

any sequence of performed operations can be undone by executing in reverse
order at any point during a computation. It has been attracting increasing
attention as it provides opportunities for low-power computation, being at the
same time essential or eligible in various applications. In recent work, we
have proposed a structural way of translating Reversing Petri Nets (RPNs) - a
type of Petri nets that embeds reversible computation, to bounded Coloured
Petri Nets (CPNs) - an extension of traditional Petri Nets, where tokens carry
data values. Three reversing semantics are possible in RPNs: backtracking
(reversing of the lately executed action), causal reversing (action can be
reversed only when all its effects have been undone) and out of causal
reversing (any previously performed action can be reversed). In this paper, we
extend the RPN to CPN translation with formal proofs of correctness. Moreover,
the possibility of introduction of cycles to RPNs is discussed. We analyze
which type of cycles could be allowed in RPNs to ensure consistency with the
current semantics. It emerged that the most interesting case related to cycles
in RPNs occurs in causal semantics, where various interpretations of dependency
result in different net's behaviour during reversing. Three definitions of
dependence are presented and discussed.]]></summary>

events in natural language. To apply it to real-time monitoring, a system needs
not only to describe events accurately but also to produce the captions as soon
as possible. Low-latency captioning is needed to realize such functionality,
but this research area for online video captioning has not been pursued yet.
This paper proposes a novel approach to optimize each caption's output timing
based on a trade-off between latency and caption quality. An audio-visual
Trans-former is trained to generate ground-truth captions using only a small
portion of all video frames, and to mimic outputs of a pre-trained Transformer
to which all the frames are given. A CNN-based timing detector is also trained
to detect a proper output timing, where the captions generated by the two
Trans-formers become sufficiently close to each other. With the jointly trained
Transformer and timing detector, a caption can be generated in the early stages
of an event-triggered video clip, as soon as an event happens or when it can be
forecasted. Experiments with the ActivityNet Captions dataset show that our
approach achieves 94% of the caption quality of the upper bound given by the
pre-trained Transformer using the entire video clips, using only 28% of frames
from the beginning.]]></summary>

challenging AI workload in recent times. State-of-the-art recommendation models
are one of the largest models rivalling the likes of GPT-3 and Switch
Transformer. Challenges in deep learning recommendation models (DLRM) stem from
learning dense embeddings for each of the categorical values. These embedding
tables in industrial scale models can be as large as hundreds of terabytes.
Such large models lead to a plethora of engineering challenges, not to mention
prohibitive communication overheads, and slower training and inference times.
Of these, slower inference time directly impacts user experience. Model
compression for DLRM is gaining traction and the community has recently shown
impressive compression results. In this paper, we present Random Offset Block
Embedding Array (ROBE) as a low memory alternative to embedding tables which
provide orders of magnitude reduction in memory usage while maintaining
accuracy and boosting execution speed. ROBE is a simple fundamental approach in
improving both cache performance and the variance of randomized hashing, which
could be of independent interest in itself. We demonstrate that we can
successfully train DLRM models with same accuracy while using $1000 \times$
less memory. A $1000\times$ compressed model directly results in faster
inference without any engineering. In particular, we show that we can train
DLRM model using ROBE Array of size 100MB on a single GPU to achieve AUC of
0.8025 or higher as required by official MLPerf CriteoTB benchmark DLRM model
of 100GB while achieving about $2.7\times$ (170\%) improvement in inference

on randomly sampled targets, yet the same systems are later used to predict
user behavior sequentially from a fixed point in time. Simulating online
recommender system performance is notoriously difficult and the discrepancy
between online and offline behaviors is typically not accounted for in offline
evaluations. This disparity permits weaknesses to go unnoticed until the model
is deployed in a production setting. In this paper, we first demonstrate how
omitting temporal context when evaluating recommender system performance leads
to false confidence. To overcome this, we postulate that offline evaluation
protocols can only model real-life use-cases if they account for temporal
context. Next, we propose a training procedure to further embed the temporal
context in existing models: we introduce it in a multi-objective approach to
traditionally time-unaware recommender systems and confirm its advantage via
the proposed evaluation protocol. Finally, we validate that the Pareto Fronts
obtained with the added objective dominate those produced by state-of-the-art
models that are only optimized for accuracy on three real-world publicly
available datasets. The results show that including our temporal objective can

recommendations in domains with limited knowledge about user preferences. We
expand the variational autoencoder collaborative filtering from a single-domain
to a multi-domain setting. The intuition is that user-item interactions in a
source domain can augment the recommendation quality in a target domain. The
intuition can be taken to its extreme, where, in a cross-domain setup, the user
history in a source domain is enough to generate high-quality recommendations
in a target one. We thus create a Product-of-Experts (POE) architecture for
recommendations that jointly models user-item interactions across multiple
domains. The method is resilient to missing data for one or more of the
domains, which is a situation often found in real life. We present results on
two widely-used datasets - Amazon and Yelp, which support the claim that
holistic user preference knowledge leads to better recommendations.
Surprisingly, we find that in some cases, a POE recommender that does not
access the target domain user representation can surpass a strong VAE
recommender baseline trained on the target domain.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Providing suitable recommendations is of vital importance to improve the user
satisfaction of music recommender systems. Here, users often listen to the same
track repeatedly and appreciate recommendations of the same song multiple
times. Thus, accounting for users' relistening behavior is critical for music
recommender systems. In this paper, we describe a psychology-informed approach
to model and predict music relistening behavior that is inspired by studies in
music psychology, which relate music preferences to human memory. We adopt a
well-established psychological theory of human cognition that models the
operations of human memory, i.e., Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R).
In contrast to prior work, which uses only the base-level component of ACT-R,
we utilize five components of ACT-R, i.e., base-level, spreading, partial
matching, valuation, and noise, to investigate the effect of five factors on
music relistening behavior: (i) recency and frequency of prior exposure to
tracks, (ii) co-occurrence of tracks, (iii) the similarity between tracks, (iv)
familiarity with tracks, and (v) randomness in behavior. On a dataset of 1.7
million listening events from Last.fm, we evaluate the performance of our
approach by sequentially predicting the next track(s) in user sessions. We find
that recency and frequency of prior exposure to tracks is an effective
predictor of relistening behavior. Besides, considering the co-occurrence of
tracks and familiarity with tracks further improves performance in terms of
R-precision. We hope that our work inspires future research on the merits of
considering cognitive aspects of memory retrieval to model and predict complex
user behavior.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Media is evolving from traditional linear narratives to personalised
experiences, where control over information (or how it is presented) is given
to individual audience members. Measuring and understanding audience engagement
with this media is important in at least two ways: (1) a post-hoc understanding
of how engaged audiences are with the content will help production teams learn
from experience and improve future productions; (2), this type of media has
potential for real-time measures of engagement to be used to enhance the user
experience by adapting content on-the-fly. Engagement is typically measured by
asking samples of users to self-report, which is time consuming and expensive.
In some domains, however, interaction data have been used to infer engagement.
Fortuitously, the nature of interactive media facilitates a much richer set of
interaction data than traditional media; our research aims to understand if
these data can be used to infer audience engagement. In this paper, we report a
study using data captured from audience interactions with an interactive TV
show to model and predict engagement. We find that temporal metrics, including
overall time spent on the experience and the interval between events, are
predictive of engagement. The results demonstrate that interaction data can be
used to infer users' engagement during and after an experience, and the
proposed techniques are relevant to better understand audience preference and
responses.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hashing plays an important role in information retrieval, due to its low
storage and high speed of processing. Among the techniques available in the
literature, multi-modal hashing, which can encode heterogeneous multi-modal
features into compact hash codes, has received particular attention. Most of
the existing multi-modal hashing methods adopt the fixed weighting factors to
fuse multiple modalities for any query data, which cannot capture the variation
of different queries. Besides, many methods introduce hyper-parameters to
balance many regularization terms that make the optimization harder. Meanwhile,
it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to set proper parameter values. The
limitations may significantly hinder their promotion in real applications. In
this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective method that is inspired by the
Hadamard matrix. The proposed method captures the multi-modal feature
information in an adaptive manner and preserves the discriminative semantic
information in the hash codes. Our framework is flexible and involves a very
few hyper-parameters. Extensive experimental results show the method is
effective and achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms.]]></summary>

To explore how to generate personalized text-aware captions, we define a new
challenging task, namely Question-controlled Text-aware Image Captioning
(Qc-TextCap). With questions as control signals, this task requires models to
understand questions, find related scene texts and describe them together with
objects fluently in human language. Based on two existing text-aware captioning
datasets, we automatically construct two datasets, ControlTextCaps and
ControlVizWiz to support the task. We propose a novel Geometry and Question
Aware Model (GQAM). GQAM first applies a Geometry-informed Visual Encoder to
fuse region-level object features and region-level scene text features with
considering spatial relationships. Then, we design a Question-guided Encoder to
select the most relevant visual features for each question. Finally, GQAM
generates a personalized text-aware caption with a Multimodal Decoder. Our
model achieves better captioning performance and question answering ability
than carefully designed baselines on both two datasets. With questions as

the state-of-the-art text-aware captioning model. Our code and datasets are

annotate data by clicks, which costs only several seconds for an image.
However, applying clicks to learn video semantic segmentation model has not
been explored before. In this work, we propose an effective weakly-supervised
video semantic segmentation pipeline with click annotations, called WeClick,
for saving laborious annotating effort by segmenting an instance of the
semantic class with only a single click. Since detailed semantic information is
not captured by clicks, directly training with click labels leads to poor
segmentation predictions. To mitigate this problem, we design a novel memory
flow knowledge distillation strategy to exploit temporal information (named
memory flow) in abundant unlabeled video frames, by distilling the neighboring
predictions to the target frame via estimated motion. Moreover, we adopt
vanilla knowledge distillation for model compression. In this case, WeClick
learns compact video semantic segmentation models with the low-cost click
annotations during the training phase yet achieves real-time and accurate
models during the inference period. Experimental results on Cityscapes and
Camvid show that WeClick outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, increases
performance by 10.24% mIoU than baseline, and achieves real-time execution.]]></summary>

automated Question Answering (QA) systems, have demonstrated both impressive
linguistic fluency and a pernicious tendency to reflect social biases. In this
study, we introduce Q-Pain, a dataset for assessing bias in medical QA in the
context of pain management, one of the most challenging forms of clinical
decision-making. Along with the dataset, we propose a new, rigorous framework,
including a sample experimental design, to measure the potential biases present
when making treatment decisions. We demonstrate its use by assessing two
reference Question-Answering systems, GPT-2 and GPT-3, and find statistically
significant differences in treatment between intersectional race-gender

automatic speech recognition (ASR) error detection during post-processing.
While error detection systems often take advantage of statistical language
archetypes captured by LMs, at times the pretrained knowledge can hinder error
detection performance. For instance, presence of speech disfluencies might
confuse the post-processing system into tagging disfluent but accurate
transcriptions as ASR errors. Such confusion occurs because both error
detection and disfluency detection tasks attempt to identify tokens at
statistically unlikely positions. This paper proposes a scheme to improve
existing LM-based ASR error detection systems, both in terms of detection
scores and resilience to such distracting auxiliary tasks. Our approach adopts
the popular mixup method in text feature space and can be utilized with any
black-box ASR output. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we
conduct post-processing experiments with both traditional and end-to-end ASR
systems (both for English and Korean languages) with 5 different speech
corpora. We find that our method improves both ASR error detection F 1 scores
and reduces the number of correctly transcribed disfluencies wrongly detected
as ASR errors. Finally, we suggest methods to utilize resulting LMs directly in
semi-supervised ASR training.]]></summary>

MuCoCO -- a flexible and modular algorithm for controllable inference from

incorporated as differentiable constraints to the optimization. By relaxing
this discrete optimization to a continuous one, we make use of Lagrangian

content, and lack background knowledge to deeply understand the image, such as
exact named entities or concrete events. In this work, we focus on the
entity-aware news image captioning task which aims to generate informative
captions by leveraging the associated news articles to provide background
knowledge about the target image. However, due to the length of news articles,
previous works only employ news articles at the coarse article or sentence
level, which are not fine-grained enough to refine relevant events and choose
named entities accurately. To overcome these limitations, we propose an
Information Concentrated Entity-aware news image CAPtioning (ICECAP) model,
which progressively concentrates on relevant textual information within the
corresponding news article from the sentence level to the word level. Our model
first creates coarse concentration on relevant sentences using a cross-modality
retrieval model and then generates captions by further concentrating on
relevant words within the sentences. Extensive experiments on both BreakingNews

sentiment analysis and aspect/target sentiment classification. The goal of the
task is to combine vision and language to understand the sentiment towards a
target entity in a sentence. Twitter is an ideal setting for the task because
it is inherently multimodal, highly emotional, and affects real world events.
However, multimodal tweets are short and accompanied by complex, possibly
irrelevant images. We introduce a two-stream model that translates images in
input space using an object-aware transformer followed by a single-pass
non-autoregressive text generation approach. We then leverage the translation
to construct an auxiliary sentence that provides multimodal information to a
language model. Our approach increases the amount of text available to the
language model and distills the object-level information in complex images. We
achieve state-of-the-art performance on two multimodal Twitter datasets without
modifying the internals of the language model to accept multimodal data,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our translation. In addition, we explain a
failure mode of a popular approach for aspect sentiment analysis when applied
to tweets. Our code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest trend in the bottom-up perspective for arbitrary-shape scene text
detection is to reason the links between text segments using Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN). Notwithstanding, the performance of the best
performing bottom-up method is still inferior to that of the best performing
top-down method even with the help of GCN. We argue that this is not mainly
caused by the limited feature capturing ability of the text proposal backbone
or GCN, but by their failure to make a full use of visual-relational features
for suppressing false detection, as well as the sub-optimal route-finding
mechanism used for grouping text segments. In this paper, we revitalize the
classic text detection frameworks by aggregating the visual-relational features
of text with two effective false positive/negative suppression mechanisms.
First, dense overlapping text segments depicting the `characterness' and
`streamline' of text are generated for further relational reasoning and weakly
supervised segment classification. Here, relational graph features are used for
suppressing false positives/negatives. Then, to fuse the relational features
with visual features, a Location-Aware Transfer (LAT) module is designed to
transfer text's relational features into visual compatible features with a Fuse
Decoding (FD) module to enhance the representation of text regions for the
second step suppression. Finally, a novel multiple-text-map-aware
contour-approximation strategy is developed, instead of the widely-used
route-finding process. Experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets, i.e.,
CTW1500, Total-Text, ICDAR2015, MSRA-TD500, and MLT2017 demonstrate that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art performance when being embedded in a
classic text detection framework, which revitalises the superb strength of the
bottom-up methods.]]></summary>

descent by solving two problems: (1) removing (or reducing) the plateau that
occurs while minimizing the cost function, (2) continually adjusting the
learning rate to an "ideal" value. The approach taken is to approximately solve
for the learning rate as a function of a trust metric. When this technique is
hybridized with momentum, it creates an especially effective gradient descent
variant, called NeogradM. It is shown to outperform Adam on several test
problems, and can easily reach cost function values that are smaller by a
factor of $10^8$, for example.]]></summary>

the identifications of many aspects in pervasive healthcare, from the adoption
of the Internet of Things through to Machine Learning (ML) techniques. As a
powerful tool, ML has been widely applied in patient-centric healthcare
solutions. To further improve the quality of patient care, Electronic Health
Records (EHRs) are widely applied in healthcare facilities nowadays. Due to the
inherent heterogeneity, unbalanced, incompleteness, and high-dimensional nature
of EHRs, it is a challenging task to employ machine learning algorithms to
analyse such EHRs for prediction and diagnostics within the scope of precision
medicine. Dimensionality reduction is an efficient data preprocessing technique
for the analysis of high dimensional data that reduces the number of features
while improving the performance of the data analysis, e.g. classification. In
this paper, we propose an efficient curvature-based feature selection method
for supporting more precise diagnosis. The proposed method is a filter-based
feature selection method, which directly utilises the Menger Curvature for
ranking all the attributes in the given data set. We evaluate the performance
of our method against conventional PCA and recent ones including BPCM, GSAM,
WCNN, BLS II, VIBES, 2L-MJFA, RFGA, and VAF. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark healthcare data sets including
CCRFDS, BCCDS, BTDS, and DRDDS with impressive 24.73% and 13.93% improvements
respectively on BTDS and CCRFDS, 7.97% improvement on BCCDS, and 3.63%
improvement on DRDDS. Our CFS source code is publicly available at

convolutional neural network (LCN). These functions form a semi-algebraic
subset of the set of linear maps from input space to output space. In contrast,
the families of functions represented by fully-connected linear networks form
algebraic sets. We observe that the functions represented by LCNs can be
identified with polynomials that admit certain factorizations, and we use this
perspective to describe the impact of the network's architecture on the
geometry of the resulting function space. We further study the optimization of
an objective function over an LCN, analyzing critical points in function space
and in parameter space, and describing dynamical invariants for gradient
descent. Overall, our theory predicts that the optimized parameters of an LCN
will often correspond to repeated filters across layers, or filters that can be

detection, named Double-Dot Network (DD-Net). It follows the recent anchor-free
object detection framework, which does not depend on empirically pre-set
anchors and thus allows more generalized and flexible prediction on unseen
objects. Specifically, unlike the widely used 5-dimensional rectangle, the
gripper configuration is defined as a pair of fingertips. An effective CNN
architecture is introduced to localize such fingertips, and with the help of
auxiliary centers for refinement, it accurately and robustly infers grasp
candidates. Additionally, we design a specialized loss function to measure the
quality of grasps, and in contrast to the IoU scores of bounding boxes adopted
in object detection, it is more consistent to the grasp detection task. Both
the simulation and robotic experiments are executed and state of the art
accuracies are achieved, showing that DD-Net is superior to the counterparts in
handling unseen objects.]]></summary>

that incorporates self-attention for multiple computer vision tasks including
image classification, object detection and instance segmentation. By just
replacing the spatial convolutions with global self-attention in the final

upon the baselines significantly on instance segmentation and object detection
while also reducing the parameters, with minimal overhead in latency. Through
the design of BoTNet, we also point out how ResNet bottleneck blocks with
self-attention can be viewed as Transformer blocks. Without any bells and
whistles, BoTNet achieves 44.4% Mask AP and 49.7% Box AP on the COCO Instance
Segmentation benchmark using the Mask R-CNN framework; surpassing the previous
best published single model and single scale results of ResNeSt evaluated on
the COCO validation set. Finally, we present a simple adaptation of the BoTNet
design for image classification, resulting in models that achieve a strong
performance of 84.7% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark while being up to
1.64x faster in compute time than the popular EfficientNet models on TPU-v3

(GDSC) for COVID-19. as on May 31 2020. COVID-19 has largely impacted on our
societies through both direct and indirect effects transmitted by the policy
measures to counter the spread of viruses. We quantitatively analysed the
multifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our societies including
people's mobility, health, and social behaviour changes. People's mobility has
changed significantly due to the implementation of travel restriction and
quarantine measurements. Indeed, the physical distance has widened at
international (cross-border), national and regional level. At international
level, due to the travel restrictions, the number of international flights has
plunged overall at around 88 percent during March. In particular, the number of
flights connecting Europe dropped drastically in mid of March after the United
States announced travel restrictions to Europe and the EU and participating
countries agreed to close borders, at 84 percent decline compared to March
10th. Similarly, we examined the impacts of quarantine measures in the major
city: Tokyo (Japan), New York City (the United States), and Barcelona (Spain).
Within all three cities, we found the significant decline in traffic volume. We
also identified the increased concern for mental health through the analysis of
posts on social networking services such as Twitter and Instagram. Notably, in
the beginning of April 2020, the number of post with #depression on Instagram
doubled, which might reflect the rise in mental health awareness among
Instagram users. Besides, we identified the changes in a wide range of people's
social behaviors, as well as economic impacts through the analysis of Instagram
data and primary survey data.]]></summary>

cognition, require reasoning about what might have happened at time t, while
conditioning on multiple contexts from the relative past and future. However,
simultaneous incorporation of past and future contexts using generative
language models (LMs) can be challenging, as they are trained either to
condition only on the past context or to perform narrowly scoped
text-infilling. In this paper, we propose DeLorean, a new unsupervised decoding
algorithm that can flexibly incorporate both the past and future contexts using
only off-the-shelf, left-to-right language models and no supervision. The key
intuition of our algorithm is incorporating the future through
back-propagation, during which, we only update the internal representation of
the output while fixing the model parameters. By alternating between forward
and backward propagation, DeLorean can decode the output representation that
reflects both the left and right contexts. We demonstrate that our approach is
general and applicable to two nonmonotonic reasoning tasks: abductive text
generation and counterfactual story revision, where DeLorean outperforms a
range of unsupervised and some supervised methods, based on automatic and human
evaluation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spectral graph convolutional networks (SGCNs) have been attracting increasing
attention in graph representation learning partly due to their interpretability
through the prism of the established graph signal processing framework.
However, existing SGCNs are limited in implementing graph convolutions with
rigid transforms that could not adapt to signals residing on graphs and tasks
at hand. In this paper, we propose a novel class of spectral graph
convolutional networks that implement graph convolutions with adaptive graph
wavelets. Specifically, the adaptive graph wavelets are learned with neural
network-parameterized lifting structures, where structure-aware attention-based
lifting operations are developed to jointly consider graph structures and node
features. We propose to lift based on diffusion wavelets to alleviate the
structural information loss induced by partitioning non-bipartite graphs. By
design, the locality and sparsity of the resulting wavelet transform as well as
the scalability of the lifting structure for large and varying-size graphs are
guaranteed. We further derive a soft-thresholding filtering operation by
learning sparse graph representations in terms of the learned wavelets, which
improves the scalability and interpretablity, and yield a localized, efficient
and scalable spectral graph convolution. To ensure that the learned graph
representations are invariant to node permutations, a layer is employed at the
input of the networks to reorder the nodes according to their local topology
information. We evaluate the proposed networks in both node-level and
graph-level representation learning tasks on benchmark citation and
bioinformatics graph datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed networks over existing SGCNs in terms of accuracy,
efficiency and scalability.]]></summary>

conditional models $p(x|z)$ and $q(z|x)$ that form a cycle. This is motivated
by the observation that deep generative models, in addition to a likelihood
model $p(x|z)$, often also use an inference model $q(z|x)$ for data
representation, but they rely on a usually uninformative prior distribution
$p(z)$ to define a joint distribution, which may render problems like posterior
collapse and manifold mismatch. To explore the possibility to model a joint
distribution using only $p(x|z)$ and $q(z|x)$, we study their compatibility and
determinacy, corresponding to the existence and uniqueness of a joint
distribution whose conditional distributions coincide with them. We develop a
general theory for novel and operable equivalence criteria for compatibility,
and sufficient conditions for determinacy. Based on the theory, we propose the
CyGen framework for cyclic-conditional generative modeling, including methods
to enforce compatibility and use the determined distribution to fit and
generate data. With the prior constraint removed, CyGen better fits data and
captures more representative features, supported by experiments showing better

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph neural networks (GNN) have shown great success in learning from
graph-structured data. They are widely used in various applications, such as
recommendation, fraud detection, and search. In these domains, the graphs are
typically large, containing hundreds of millions of nodes and several billions
of edges. To tackle this challenge, we develop DistDGL, a system for training
GNNs in a mini-batch fashion on a cluster of machines. DistDGL is based on the
Deep Graph Library (DGL), a popular GNN development framework. DistDGL
distributes the graph and its associated data (initial features and embeddings)
across the machines and uses this distribution to derive a computational
decomposition by following an owner-compute rule. DistDGL follows a synchronous
training approach and allows ego-networks forming the mini-batches to include
non-local nodes. To minimize the overheads associated with distributed
computations, DistDGL uses a high-quality and light-weight min-cut graph
partitioning algorithm along with multiple balancing constraints. This allows
it to reduce communication overheads and statically balance the computations.
It further reduces the communication by replicating halo nodes and by using
sparse embedding updates. The combination of these design choices allows
DistDGL to train high-quality models while achieving high parallel efficiency
and memory scalability. We demonstrate our optimizations on both inductive and
transductive GNN models. Our results show that DistDGL achieves linear speedup
without compromising model accuracy and requires only 13 seconds to complete a
training epoch for a graph with 100 million nodes and 3 billion edges on a
cluster with 16 machines. DistDGL is now publicly available as part of
DGL:https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/python/dgl/distributed.]]></summary>

high-dimensional manifolds. Industry applications of DGMs include data
augmentation to boost performance of (semi-)supervised machine learning, or to
mitigate fairness or privacy concerns. Large-scale DGMs are notoriously hard to
train, requiring expert skills, large amounts of data and extensive
computational resources. Thus, it can be expected that many enterprises will
resort to sourcing pre-trained DGMs from potentially unverified third parties,
e.g.~open source model repositories.

As we show in this paper, such a deployment scenario poses a new attack
surface, which allows adversaries to potentially undermine the integrity of
entire machine learning development pipelines in a victim organization.
Specifically, we describe novel training-time attacks resulting in corrupted
DGMs that synthesize regular data under normal operations and designated target
outputs for inputs sampled from a trigger distribution. Depending on the
control that the adversary has over the random number generation, this imposes
various degrees of risk that harmful data may enter the machine learning
development pipelines, potentially causing material or reputational damage to
the victim organization.

Our attacks are based on adversarial loss functions that combine the dual
objectives of attack stealth and fidelity. We show its effectiveness for a
variety of DGM architectures (Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)) and data domains (images, audio). Our
experiments show that - even for large-scale industry-grade DGMs - our attack
can be mounted with only modest computational efforts. We also investigate the
effectiveness of different defensive approaches (based on static/dynamic model
and output inspections) and prescribe a practical defense strategy that paves
the way for safe usage of DGMs.]]></summary>

domain (source) does not perform well when exposed to samples from a different
domain (target). Unsupervised methods that can adapt to domain shift are highly
desirable as they allow effective utilization of the source data without
requiring additional annotated training data from the target. Practically,
obtaining sufficient amount of annotated data from the target domain can be
both infeasible and extremely expensive. In this work, we address the domain
shift problem for the object detection task. Our approach relies on gradually
removing the domain shift between the source and the target domains. The key
ingredients to our approach are -- (a) mapping the source to the target domain
on pixel-level; (b) training a teacher network on the mapped source and the
unannotated target domain using adversarial feature alignment; and (c) finally
training a student network using the pseudo-labels obtained from the teacher.
Experimentally, when tested on challenging scenarios involving domain shift, we
consistently obtain significantly large performance gains over various recent
state of the art approaches.]]></summary>

predicts the performance of algorithms given historical data that may have been

prediction converges in probability to the true performance of a counterfactual
algorithm at a rate of $\sqrt{N}$, as the sample size $N$ increases. We also
show a correct way to estimate the variance of our prediction, thus allowing
the analyst to quantify the uncertainty in the prediction. These properties
hold even when the analyst does not know which among a large number of
potentially important state variables are actually important. We validate our
method by a simulation experiment about reinforcement learning. We finally
apply it to improve advertisement design by a major advertisement company. We

solutions for human detection by robots, particularly in selected use-cases
such as pedestrian detection for self-driving cars or close-range person
detection in consumer settings. Despite this progress, the simple question
"which sensor-algorithm combination is best suited for a person detection task
at hand?" remains hard to answer. In this paper, we tackle this issue by
conducting a systematic cross-modal analysis of sensor-algorithm combinations
typically used in robotics. We compare the performance of state-of-the-art
person detectors for 2D range data, 3D lidar, and RGB-D data as well as
selected combinations thereof in a challenging industrial use-case.

We further address the related problems of data scarcity in the industrial
target domain, and that recent research on human detection in 3D point clouds
has mostly focused on autonomous driving scenarios. To leverage these
methodological advances for robotics applications, we utilize a simple, yet
effective multi-sensor transfer learning strategy by extending a strong
image-based RGB-D detector to provide cross-modal supervision for lidar
detectors in the form of weak 3D bounding box labels.

Our results show a large variance among the different approaches in terms of
detection performance, generalization, frame rates and computational
requirements. As our use-case contains difficulties representative for a wide
range of service robot applications, we believe that these results point to
relevant open challenges for further research and provide valuable support to
practitioners for the design of their robot system.]]></summary>

learn a probabilistic prior over speech signals, which is then used to perform
speech enhancement. Variational autoencoders have then been conditioned on a
label describing a high-level speech attribute (e.g. speech activity) that
allows for a more explicit control of speech generation. However, the label is
not guaranteed to be disentangled from the other latent variables, which
results in limited performance improvements compared to the standard
variational autoencoder. In this work, we propose to use an adversarial
training scheme for variational autoencoders to disentangle the label from the
other latent variables. At training, we use a discriminator that competes with
the encoder of the variational autoencoder. Simultaneously, we also use an
additional encoder that estimates the label for the decoder of the variational
autoencoder, which proves to be crucial to learn disentanglement. We show the
benefit of the proposed disentanglement learning when a voice activity label,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Language bias is a critical issue in Visual Question Answering (VQA), where
models often exploit dataset biases for the final decision without considering
the image information. As a result, they suffer from performance drop on
out-of-distribution data and inadequate visual explanation. Based on
experimental analysis for existing robust VQA methods, we stress the language
bias in VQA that comes from two aspects, i.e., distribution bias and shortcut
bias. We further propose a new de-bias framework, Greedy Gradient Ensemble
(GGE), which combines multiple biased models for unbiased base model learning.
With the greedy strategy, GGE forces the biased models to over-fit the biased
data distribution in priority, thus makes the base model pay more attention to
examples that are hard to solve by biased models. The experiments demonstrate
that our method makes better use of visual information and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on diagnosing dataset VQA-CP without using extra
annotations.]]></summary>

ability to learn policies without potentially unsafe or impractical
exploration. Significant progress has been made in the past few years in
dealing with the challenge of correcting for differing behavior between the
data collection and learned policies. However, little attention has been paid
to potentially changing dynamics when transferring a policy to the online
setting, where performance can be up to 90% reduced for existing methods. In
this paper we address this problem with Augmented World Models (AugWM). We
augment a learned dynamics model with simple transformations that seek to
capture potential changes in physical properties of the robot, leading to more
robust policies. We not only train our policy in this new setting, but also
provide it with the sampled augmentation as a context, allowing it to adapt to
changes in the environment. At test time we learn the context in a
self-supervised fashion by approximating the augmentation which corresponds to
the new environment. We rigorously evaluate our approach on over 100 different
changed dynamics settings, and show that this simple approach can significantly
improve the zero-shot generalization of a recent state-of-the-art baseline,
often achieving successful policies where the baseline fails.]]></summary>

problem subject to a knapsack and a $k$-system constraints. The input of our
problem is a set of items, where each item has a particular state drawn from a
known prior distribution. However, the state of an item is initially unknown,
one must select an item in order to reveal the state of that item. There is a
utility function which is defined over items and states. Our objective is to
sequentially select a group of items to maximize the expected utility. Although
the cardinality-constrained non-monotone adaptive submodular maximization has
been well studied in the literature, whether there exists a constant
approximation solution for the knapsack-constrained or $k$-system constrained
adaptive submodular maximization problem remains an open problem. It fact, it
has only been settled given the additional assumption of pointwise
submodularity. In this paper, we remove the common assumption on pointwise
submodularity and propose the first constant approximation solutions for both
cases. Inspired by two recent studies on non-monotone adaptive submodular
maximization, we develop a sampling-based randomized algorithm that achieves a
$\frac{1}{10}$ approximation for the case of a knapsack constraint and that
achieves a $\frac{1}{2k+4}$ approximation ratio for the case of a $k$-system

disease in over 200 countries, influencing billions of humans. To control the
infection, identifying and separating the infected people is the most crucial
step. The main diagnostic tool is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Still, the sensitivity of the RT-PCR test is not high
enough to effectively prevent the pandemic. The chest CT scan test provides a
valuable complementary tool to the RT-PCR test, and it can identify the
patients in the early-stage with high sensitivity. However, the chest CT scan
test is usually time-consuming, requiring about 21.5 minutes per case. This
paper develops a novel Joint Classification and Segmentation (JCS) system to
perform real-time and explainable COVID-19 chest CT diagnosis. To train our JCS
system, we construct a large scale COVID-19 Classification and Segmentation
(COVID-CS) dataset, with 144,167 chest CT images of 400 COVID-19 patients and
350 uninfected cases. 3,855 chest CT images of 200 patients are annotated with
fine-grained pixel-level labels of opacifications, which are increased
attenuation of the lung parenchyma. We also have annotated lesion counts,
opacification areas, and locations and thus benefit various diagnosis aspects.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed JCS diagnosis system is
very efficient for COVID-19 classification and segmentation. It obtains an
average sensitivity of 95.0% and a specificity of 93.0% on the classification
test set, and 78.5% Dice score on the segmentation test set of our COVID-CS
dataset. The COVID-CS dataset and code are available at

traditional statistical inference procedures is often prohibitive due to
communication cost and privacy concerns. This paper develops and investigates
two Communication-Efficient Accurate Statistical Estimators (CEASE),
implemented through iterative algorithms for distributed optimization. In each
iteration, node machines carry out computation in parallel and communicate with
the central processor, which then broadcasts aggregated information to node
machines for new updates. The algorithms adapt to the similarity among loss
functions on node machines, and converge rapidly when each node machine has
large enough sample size. Moreover, they do not require good initialization and
enjoy linear converge guarantees under general conditions. The contraction rate
of optimization errors is presented explicitly, with dependence on the local
sample size unveiled. In addition, the improved statistical accuracy per
iteration is derived. By regarding the proposed method as a multi-step
statistical estimator, we show that statistical efficiency can be achieved in
finite steps in typical statistical applications. In addition, we give the
conditions under which the one-step CEASE estimator is statistically efficient.
Extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the

manifold of VB approximating probability distributions. Our algorithm is

O(1/\sqrt{T})$ and $\mathcal O(1/T^{2-2\epsilon})$ for a non-convex evidence
lower bound function and a strongly retraction-convex evidence lower bound

there is a change in data distribution between training and test domains. When
the aim is to make predictions on distributions different from those seen at

issue learn a model using data from multiple source domains, and then apply
this model to the unseen target domain. Our hypothesis is that when training
with multiple domains, conflicting gradients within each mini-batch contain
information specific to the individual domains which is irrelevant to the
others, including the test domain. If left untouched, such disagreement may
degrade generalization performance. In this work, we characterize the
conflicting gradients emerging in domain shift scenarios and devise novel
gradient agreement strategies based on gradient surgery to alleviate their
effect. We validate our approach in image classification tasks with three
multi-domain datasets, showing the value of the proposed agreement strategy in

applications. However, it is difficult to tell beforehand if a DNN receiving an

area enclosed by its generalization envelope. In this case, the information
contained in the input sample is processed reasonably by the network. It is of
large practical importance to assess at inference time if a DNN generalizes
correctly. Currently, the approaches to achieve this goal are investigated in
different problem set-ups rather independently from one another, leading to
three main research and literature fields: predictive uncertainty,
out-of-distribution detection and adversarial example detection. This survey
connects the three fields within the larger framework of investigating the
generalization performance of machine learning methods and in particular DNNs.
We underline the common ground, point at the most promising approaches and give

novel hardware designs. Recently, tunable nanoelectronic devices were developed
based on hopping electrons through a network of dopant atoms in silicon. These
"Dopant Network Processing Units" (DNPUs) are highly energy-efficient and have
potentially very high throughput. By adapting the control voltages applied to
its terminals, a single DNPU can solve a variety of linearly non-separable
classification problems. However, using a single device has limitations due to
the implicit single-node architecture. This paper presents a promising novel
approach to neural information processing by introducing DNPUs as high-capacity
neurons and moving from a single to a multi-neuron framework. By implementing
and testing a small multi-DNPU classifier in hardware, we show that
feed-forward DNPU networks improve the performance of a single DNPU from 77% to
94% test accuracy on a binary classification task with concentric classes on a
plane. Furthermore, motivated by the integration of DNPUs with memristor
arrays, we study the potential of using DNPUs in combination with linear
layers. We show by simulation that a single-layer MNIST classifier with only 10
DNPUs achieves over 96% test accuracy. Our results pave the road towards
hardware neural-network emulators that offer atomic-scale information
processing with low latency and energy consumption.]]></summary>

which requires massive strictly labeled data. In comparison with video data,
activity data recorded from accelerometer or gyroscope is often more difficult
to interpret and segment. Recently, several attention mechanisms are proposed
to handle the weakly labeled human activity data, which do not require accurate
data annotation. However, these attention-based models can only handle the
weakly labeled dataset whose sample includes one target activity, as a result
it limits efficiency and practicality. In the paper, we propose a recurrent
attention networks (RAN) to handle sequential weakly labeled multi-activity
recognition and location tasks. The model can repeatedly perform steps of
attention on multiple activities of one sample and each step is corresponding
to the current focused activity. The effectiveness of the RAN model is
validated on a collected sequential weakly labeled multi-activity dataset and
the other two public datasets. The experiment results show that our RAN model
can simultaneously infer multi-activity types from the coarse-grained
sequential weak labels and determine specific locations of every target
activity with only knowledge of which types of activities contained in the long
sequence. It will greatly reduce the burden of manual labeling. The code of our
work is available at https://github.com/KennCoder7/RAN.]]></summary>

of A$\beta$ protein inhibiting cell function. Deep learning speeds up the
process by making only low-level data sufficient for fruitful inspection. We
first found Unet is most suitable in augmented microscopy by comparing
performance in multi-class semantics segmentation. We develop the augmented
microscopy method to capture nuclei in a brightfield image and the transformer
using Unet model to convert an input image into a sequence of topological
information. The performance regarding Intersection-over-Union is consistent
concerning the choice of image preprocessing and ground-truth generation.
Training model with data of a specific cell type demonstrates transfer learning
applies to some extent.

The topological transformer aims to extract persistence silhouettes or
landscape signatures containing geometric information of a given image of
cells. This feature extraction facilitates studying an image as a collection of
one-dimensional data, substantially reducing computational costs. Using the
transformer, we attempt grouping cell images by their cell type relying solely
on topological features. Performances of the transformers followed by SVM,
XGBoost, LGBM, and simple convolutional neural network classifiers are inferior
to the conventional image classification. However, since this research
initiates a new perspective in biomedical research by combining deep learning
and topology for image analysis, we speculate follow-up investigation will
reinforce our genuine regime.]]></summary>

supervision is an important problem in computer vision. However, despite its
significance, this problem remains rather unexplored, with a few exceptions
that considered unsupervised semantic segmentation on small-scale datasets with
a narrow visual domain. In this paper, we make a first attempt to tackle the
problem on datasets that have been traditionally utilized for the supervised
case. To achieve this, we introduce a two-step framework that adopts a
predetermined mid-level prior in a contrastive optimization objective to learn
pixel embeddings. This marks a large deviation from existing works that relied
on proxy tasks or end-to-end clustering. Additionally, we argue about the
importance of having a prior that contains information about objects, or their
parts, and discuss several possibilities to obtain such a prior in an
unsupervised manner.

Experimental evaluation shows that our method comes with key advantages over
existing works. First, the learned pixel embeddings can be directly clustered
in semantic groups using K-Means on PASCAL. Under the fully unsupervised
setting, there is no precedent in solving the semantic segmentation task on
such a challenging benchmark. Second, our representations can improve over
strong baselines when transferred to new datasets, e.g. COCO and DAVIS. The

the question: which, if any, of these dissimilarity measures should we believe?
We provide a framework to ground this question through a concrete test:
measures should have sensitivity to changes that affect functional behavior,
and specificity against changes that do not. We quantify this through a variety
of functional behaviors including probing accuracy and robustness to
distribution shift, and examine changes such as varying random initialization
and deleting principal components. We find that current metrics exhibit
different weaknesses, note that a classical baseline performs surprisingly

computational advantages and connection to biology. But how the level of
sparsity contributes to performance on visual tasks is not well understood. In
this work, sparse coding has been integrated into an existing hierarchical V2
model (Hosoya and Hyv\"arinen, 2015), but replacing the Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) with an explicit sparse coding in which the degree of sparsity
can be controlled. After training, the sparse coding basis functions with a
higher degree of sparsity resembled qualitatively different structures, such as
curves and corners. The contributions of the models were assessed with image
classification tasks, including object classification, and tasks associated
with mid-level vision including figure-ground classification, texture
classification, and angle prediction between two line stimuli. In addition, the
models were assessed in comparison to a texture sensitivity measure that has
been reported in V2 (Freeman et al., 2013), and a deleted-region inference
task. The results from the experiments show that while sparse coding performed
worse than ICA at classifying images, only sparse coding was able to better
match the texture sensitivity level of V2 and infer deleted image regions, both
by increasing the degree of sparsity in sparse coding. Higher degrees of
sparsity allowed for inference over larger deleted image regions. The mechanism
that allows for this inference capability in sparse coding is described here.]]></summary>

clustering is easy to interpret because every decision node of a threshold tree

follow different trends on the sequential recommendations. Hence, baseline
strategies might ignore important sequential interactions or add noise to the

gripper configuration is defined as a pair of fingertips. An effective CNN

auxiliary centers for refinement, it accurately and robustly infers grasp
candidates. Additionally, we design a specialized loss function to measure the
quality of grasps, and in contrast to the IoU scores of bounding boxes adopted

been playing an important role in many e-commerce applications. As the
information being searched over the internet is rapidly increasing, users often
face the difficulty of finding items of his/her own interest and RS often
provides help in such tasks. Recent studies show that, as the item space
increases, and the number of items rated by the users become very less, issues
like sparsity arise. To mitigate the sparsity problem, transfer learning
techniques are being used wherein the data from dense domain(source) is
considered in order to predict the missing entries in the sparse
domain(target). In this paper, we propose a transfer learning approach for
cross-domain recommendation when both domains have no overlap of users and
items. In our approach the transferring of knowledge from source to target
domain is done in a novel way. We make use of co-clustering technique to obtain
the codebook (cluster-level rating pattern) of source domain. By making use of
hinge loss function we transfer the learnt codebook of the source domain to
target. The use of hinge loss as a loss function is novel and has not been
tried before in transfer learning. We demonstrate that our technique improves

traffic. This paper presents a novel driver behavior learning approach that
captures the uniqueness and richness of human driver behavior in realistic
driving scenarios. A stochastic inverse reinforcement learning (SIRL) approach
is proposed to learn a distribution of cost function, which represents the
richness of the human driver behavior with a given set of driver-specific
demonstrations. Evaluations are conducted on the realistic driving data
collected from the 3D driver-in-the-loop driving simulation. The results show
that the learned stochastic driver model is capable of expressing the richness
of the human driving strategies under different realistic driving scenarios.
Compared to the deterministic baseline driver behavior model, the results
reveal that the proposed stochastic driver behavior model can better replicate
the driver's unique and rich driving strategies in a variety of traffic
conditions.]]></summary>

two critical issues, i.e., 1) fracture detections at the gaps in a text
instance; and 2) inaccurate detections of arbitrary-shaped text instances with
diverse background context. To address these issues, we propose a novel method
named Intra- and Inter-Instance Collaborative Learning (I3CL). Specifically, to
address the first issue, we design an effective convolutional module with
multiple receptive fields, which is able to collaboratively learn better
character and gap feature representations at local and long ranges inside a
text instance. To address the second issue, we devise an instance-based
transformer module to exploit the dependencies between different text instances
and a pixel-based transformer module to exploit the global context from the
shared background, which are able to collaboratively learn more discriminative
text feature representations. In this way, I3CL can effectively exploit the
intra- and inter-instance dependencies together in a unified end-to-end
trainable framework. Experimental results show that the proposed I3CL sets new
state-of-the-art performances on three challenging public benchmarks, i.e., an
F-measure of 76.4% on ICDAR2019-ArT, 86.2% on Total-Text, and 85.8% on
CTW-1500. Besides, I3CL with ResNeSt-101 backbone ranked 1st place on the
ICDAR2019-ArT leaderboard. The source code will be made publicly available.]]></summary>

others' future motion to decide on its next action. This decision is selected
to minimize a loss function that decreases as the uncertainty in the targets'

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The field of Continual Learning (CL) seeks to develop algorithms that
accumulate knowledge and skills over time through interaction with
non-stationary environments and data distributions. Measuring progress in CL
can be difficult because a plethora of evaluation procedures (ettings) and
algorithmic solutions (methods) have emerged, each with their own potentially
disjoint set of assumptions about the CL problem. In this work, we view each
setting as a set of assumptions. We then create a tree-shaped hierarchy of the
research settings in CL, in which more general settings become the parents of
those with more restrictive assumptions. This makes it possible to use
inheritance to share and reuse research, as developing a method for a given
setting also makes it directly applicable onto any of its children. We
instantiate this idea as a publicly available software framework called
Sequoia, which features a variety of settings from both the Continual
Supervised Learning (CSL) and Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) domains.
Sequoia also includes a growing suite of methods which are easy to extend and
customize, in addition to more specialized methods from third-party libraries.
We hope that this new paradigm and its first implementation can serve as a
foundation for the unification and acceleration of research in CL. You can help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, the design of a rational decision support system (RDSS) for a
connected and autonomous vehicle charging infrastructure (CAV-CI) is studied.
In the considered CAV-CI, the distribution system operator (DSO) deploys
electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) to provide an EV charging facility for
human-driven connected vehicles (CVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). The
charging request by the human-driven EV becomes irrational when it demands more
energy and charging period than its actual need. Therefore, the scheduling
policy of each EVSE must be adaptively accumulated the irrational charging
request to satisfy the charging demand of both CVs and AVs. To tackle this, we
formulate an RDSS problem for the DSO, where the objective is to maximize the
charging capacity utilization by satisfying the laxity risk of the DSO. Thus,
we devise a rational reward maximization problem to adapt the irrational
behavior by CVs in a data-informed manner. We propose a novel risk adversarial
multi-agent learning system (RAMALS) for CAV-CI to solve the formulated RDSS
problem. In RAMALS, the DSO acts as a centralized risk adversarial agent (RAA)
for informing the laxity risk to each EVSE. Subsequently, each EVSE plays the
role of a self-learner agent to adaptively schedule its own EV sessions by
coping advice from RAA. Experiment results show that the proposed RAMALS
affords around 46.6% improvement in charging rate, about 28.6% improvement in
the EVSE's active charging time and at least 33.3% more energy utilization, as
compared to a currently deployed ACN EVSE system, and other baselines.]]></summary>

This function is used to learn an optimal policy describing the expert's

personalized recommendations. We evaluate the performance of our solution
through a user interest simulation environment (using RecSim). We simulate
interactions under the aforementioned expert policy for videos recommendation,
and compare its efficiency with standard recommendation methods. The results

multi-document summarization. It not only makes use of the relationships among
the sentences, but also the relationships between the given query and the
sentences. However, the information of original query is often insufficient. So
we present a query expansion method, which is combined in the manifold ranking
to resolve this problem. Our method not only utilizes the information of the
query term itself and the knowledge base WordNet to expand it by synonyms, but
also uses the information of the document set itself to expand the query in
various ways (mean expansion, variance expansion and TextRank expansion).
Compared with the previous query expansion methods, our method combines
multiple query expansion methods to better represent query information, and at
the same time, it makes a useful attempt on manifold ranking. In addition, we
use the degree of word overlap and the proximity between words to calculate the
similarity between sentences. We performed experiments on the datasets of DUC
2006 and DUC2007, and the evaluation results show that the proposed query
expansion method can significantly improve the system performance and make our

of the generated data has become a topic of interest in the context of deep
generative models of music. Recent attempts in this direction have relied on
learning disentangled representations from data such that the underlying
factors of variation are well separated. In this paper, we focus on the
relationship between disentanglement and controllability by conducting a
systematic study using different supervised disentanglement learning algorithms
based on the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) architecture. Our experiments show
that a high degree of disentanglement can be achieved by using different forms
of supervision to train a strong discriminative encoder. However, in the
absence of a strong generative decoder, disentanglement does not necessarily
imply controllability. The structure of the latent space with respect to the
VAE-decoder plays an important role in boosting the ability of a generative
model to manipulate different attributes. To this end, we also propose methods
and metrics to help evaluate the quality of a latent space with respect to the
afforded degree of controllability.]]></summary>

metering infrastructure and local energy applications (e.g. electric vehicles)
as well as the increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy at both
transmission and distribution level, which characterizes the peak load demand
with stronger randomness and less predictability and therefore poses a threat
to the power grid security. Since storing large quantities of electricity to
satisfy load demand is neither economically nor environmentally friendly,
effective peak demand management strategies and reliable peak load forecast
methods become essential for optimizing the power system operations. To this
end, this paper provides a timely and comprehensive overview of peak load
demand forecast methods in the literature. To our best knowledge, this is the
first comprehensive review on such topic. In this paper we first give a precise
and unified problem definition of peak load demand forecast. Second, 139 papers
on peak load forecast methods were systematically reviewed where methods were
classified into different stages based on the timeline. Thirdly, a comparative
analysis of peak load forecast methods are summarized and different optimizing
methods to improve the forecast performance are discussed. The paper ends with

autonomous driving, human-robot interaction), which aims to predict future
motion sequences given a set of historical observations. However, the observed
elements may be of different levels of importance. Some information may be
irrelevant or even distracting to the forecasting in certain situations. To
address this issue, we propose a generic motion forecasting framework (named
RAIN) with dynamic key information selection and ranking based on a hybrid
attention mechanism. The general framework is instantiated to handle
multi-agent trajectory prediction and human motion forecasting tasks,
respectively. In the former task, the model learns to recognize the relations
between agents with a graph representation and to determine their relative
significance. In the latter task, the model learns to capture the temporal
proximity and dependency in long-term human motions. We also propose an
effective double-stage training pipeline with an alternating training strategy
to optimize the parameters in different modules of the framework. We validate
the framework on both synthetic simulations and motion forecasting benchmarks
in different domains, demonstrating that our method not only achieves
state-of-the-art forecasting performance, but also provides interpretable and
reasonable hybrid attention weights.]]></summary>

developing robotic telescopes and, as a result, sky surveys (both terrestrial
and space) have become the source of a substantial amount of new observational
data. These data contain a lot of information about binary stars, hidden in
their light curves. With the huge amount of astronomical data gathered, it is
not reasonable to expect all the data to be manually processed and analyzed.
Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the automatic classification of eclipsing
binary stars using deep learning methods. Our classifier provides a tool for
the categorization of light curves of binary stars into two classes: detached
and over-contact. We used the ELISa software to obtain synthetic data, which we
then used for the training of the classifier. For evaluation purposes, we
collected 100 light curves of observed binary stars, in order to evaluate a
number of classifiers. We evaluated semi-detached eclipsing binary stars as
detached. The best-performing classifier combines bidirectional Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, which
achieved 98% accuracy on the evaluation set. Omitting semi-detached eclipsing
binary stars, we could obtain 100% accuracy in classification.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Channel estimation and beamforming play critical roles in frequency-division
duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However,
these two modules have been treated as two stand-alone components, which makes
it difficult to achieve a global system optimality. In this paper, we propose a
deep learning-based approach that directly optimizes the beamformers at the
base station according to the received uplink pilots, thereby, bypassing the
explicit channel estimation. Different from the existing fully data-driven
approach where all the modules are replaced by deep neural networks (DNNs), a
neural calibration method is proposed to improve the scalability of the
end-to-end design. In particular, the backbone of conventional time-efficient
algorithms, i.e., the least-squares (LS) channel estimator and the zero-forcing
(ZF) beamformer, is preserved and DNNs are leveraged to calibrate their inputs
for better performance. The permutation equivariance property of the formulated
resource allocation problem is then identified to design a low-complexity
neural network architecture. Simulation results will show the superiority of
the proposed neural calibration method over benchmark schemes in terms of both
the spectral efficiency and scalability in large-scale wireless networks.]]></summary>

temporal pattern recognition to be performed directly in physical matter. By
exciting non-linear dynamical systems and linearly classifying their changes in
state, we can create highly energy-efficient devices capable of solving machine
learning tasks without the need to build a modular system consisting of
millions of neurons interconnected by synapses. The chosen dynamical system
must have three desirable properties: non-linearity, complexity, and fading
memory to act as an effective reservoir. We present task agnostic quantitative
measures for each of these three requirements and exemplify them for two
reservoirs: an echo state network and a simulated magnetic skyrmion-based
reservoir. We show that, in general, systems with lower damping reach higher
values in all three performance metrics. Whilst for input signal strength,
there is a natural trade-off between memory capacity and non-linearity of the
reservoir's behaviour. In contrast to typical task-dependent reservoir
computing benchmarks, these metrics can be evaluated in parallel from a single
input signal, drastically speeding up the parameter search to design efficient

effective, these methods still have a few shortcomings that limit empirical
performance. In this paper, we first identify the discrepancy between training

discuss the potential limitations caused by the "competitive" nature of softmax
normalization. Motivated by these limitations, we propose a novel binary
classification training framework, termed SphereFace2. In contrast to existing
methods, SphereFace2 circumvents the softmax normalization, as well as the
corresponding closed-set assumption. This effectively bridges the gap between
training and evaluation, enabling the representations to be improved
individually by each binary classification task. Besides designing a specific
well-performing loss function, we summarize a few general principles for this
"one-vs-all" binary classification framework so that it can outperform current
competitive methods. We conduct comprehensive experiments on popular benchmarks
to demonstrate that SphereFace2 can consistently outperform current

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Click-through rate prediction is one of the core tasks in commercial
recommender systems. It aims to predict the probability of a user clicking a
particular item given user and item features. As feature interactions bring in
non-linearity, they are widely adopted to improve the performance of CTR
prediction models. Therefore, effectively modelling feature interactions has
attracted much attention in both the research and industry field. The current
approaches can generally be categorized into three classes: (1) na\"ive
methods, which do not model feature interactions and only use original
features; (2) memorized methods, which memorize feature interactions by
explicitly viewing them as new features and assigning trainable embeddings; (3)
factorized methods, which learn latent vectors for original features and
implicitly model feature interactions through factorization functions. Studies
have shown that modelling feature interactions by one of these methods alone
are suboptimal due to the unique characteristics of different feature
interactions. To address this issue, we first propose a general framework
called OptInter which finds the most suitable modelling method for each feature
interaction. Different state-of-the-art deep CTR models can be viewed as
instances of OptInter. To realize the functionality of OptInter, we also
introduce a learning algorithm that automatically searches for the optimal
modelling method. We conduct extensive experiments on four large datasets. Our
experiments show that OptInter improves the best performed state-of-the-art
baseline deep CTR models by up to 2.21%. Compared to the memorized method,
which also outperforms baselines, we reduce up to 91% parameters. In addition,
we conduct several ablation studies to investigate the influence of different
components of OptInter. Finally, we provide interpretable discussions on the

predictions are highly sensitive. We take a different approach to saliency, in
which we identify and analyze the network parameters, rather than inputs, which
are responsible for erroneous decisions. We find that samples which cause
similar parameters to malfunction are semantically similar. We also show that
pruning the most salient parameters for a wrongly classified sample often
improves model behavior. Furthermore, fine-tuning a small number of the most
salient parameters on a single sample results in error correction on other
samples that are misclassified for similar reasons. Based on our parameter
saliency method, we also introduce an input-space saliency technique that
reveals how image features cause specific network components to malfunction.
Further, we rigorously validate the meaningfulness of our saliency maps on both
the dataset and case-study levels.]]></summary>

of A$\beta$ protein inhibiting cell function. Deep learning speeds up the
process by making only low-level data sufficient for fruitful inspection. We
first found Unet is most suitable in augmented microscopy by comparing
performance in multi-class semantics segmentation. We develop the augmented
microscopy method to capture nuclei in a brightfield image and the transformer
using Unet model to convert an input image into a sequence of topological
information. The performance regarding Intersection-over-Union is consistent
concerning the choice of image preprocessing and ground-truth generation.
Training model with data of a specific cell type demonstrates transfer learning
applies to some extent.

The topological transformer aims to extract persistence silhouettes or
landscape signatures containing geometric information of a given image of
cells. This feature extraction facilitates studying an image as a collection of
one-dimensional data, substantially reducing computational costs. Using the
transformer, we attempt grouping cell images by their cell type relying solely
on topological features. Performances of the transformers followed by SVM,
XGBoost, LGBM, and simple convolutional neural network classifiers are inferior
to the conventional image classification. However, since this research
initiates a new perspective in biomedical research by combining deep learning
and topology for image analysis, we speculate follow-up investigation will
reinforce our genuine regime.]]></summary>

estimate people densities in individual images. As such, only very few take
advantage of temporal consistency in video sequences, and those that do only
impose weak smoothness constraints across consecutive frames. In this paper, we
advocate estimating people flows across image locations between consecutive
images and inferring the people densities from these flows instead of directly
regressing them. This enables us to impose much stronger constraints encoding
the conservation of the number of people. As a result, it significantly boosts
performance without requiring a more complex architecture. Furthermore, it
allows us to exploit the correlation between people flow and optical flow to
further improve the results. We also show that leveraging people conservation
constraints in both a spatial and temporal manner makes it possible to train a
deep crowd counting model in an active learning setting with much fewer
annotations. This significantly reduces the annotation cost while still leading
to similar performance to the full supervision case.]]></summary>

excessive sample demands. However, the predictions of the dynamics models are
often not accurate enough, and the resulting bias may incur catastrophic
decisions due to insufficient robustness. Therefore, it is highly desired to
investigate how to improve the robustness of model-based RL algorithms while
maintaining high sampling efficiency. In this paper, we propose Model-Based
Double-dropout Planning (MBDP) to balance robustness and efficiency. MBDP
consists of two kinds of dropout mechanisms, where the rollout-dropout aims to
improve the robustness with a small cost of sample efficiency, while the
model-dropout is designed to compensate for the lost efficiency at a slight
expense of robustness. By combining them in a complementary way, MBDP provides
a flexible control mechanism to meet different demands of robustness and
efficiency by tuning two corresponding dropout ratios. The effectiveness of
MBDP is demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Controlling the style of natural language by disentangling the latent space
is an important step towards interpretable machine learning. After the latent
space is disentangled, the style of a sentence can be transformed by tuning the
style representation without affecting other features of the sentence. Previous
works usually use adversarial training to guarantee that disentangled vectors
do not affect each other. However, adversarial methods are difficult to train.
Especially when there are multiple features (e.g., sentiment, or tense, which
we call style types in this paper), each feature requires a separate
discriminator for extracting a disentangled style vector corresponding to that
feature. In this paper, we propose a unified distribution-controlling method,
which provides each specific style value (the value of style types, e.g.,
positive sentiment, or past tense) with a unique representation. This method
contributes a solid theoretical basis to avoid adversarial training in
multi-type disentanglement. We also propose multiple loss functions to achieve
a style-content disentanglement as well as a disentanglement among multiple
style types. In addition, we observe that if two different style types always
have some specific style values that occur together in the dataset, they will
affect each other when transferring the style values. We call this phenomenon
training bias, and we propose a loss function to alleviate such training bias
while disentangling multiple types. We conduct experiments on two datasets
(Yelp service reviews and Amazon product reviews) to evaluate the
style-disentangling effect and the unsupervised style transfer performance on
two style types: sentiment and tense. The experimental results show the
effectiveness of our model.]]></summary>

usage in low-power, e.g. mobile, devices. Recently, massively-parallel hardware
accelerators were developed that offer high throughput and low latency at low
power by utilizing in-memory computation. However, to exploit these benefits
the computational graph of a neural network has to fit into the in-computation
memory of these hardware systems that is usually rather limited in size. In
this study, we introduce a class of network models that have a small memory
footprint in terms of their computational graphs. To this end, the graph is
designed to contain loops by iteratively executing a single network building
block. Furthermore, the trade-off between accuracy and latency of these
so-called iterative neural networks is improved by adding multiple intermediate
outputs during both training and inference. We show state-of-the-art results

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning models have achieved great success in recent years but progress
in some domains like cybersecurity is stymied due to a paucity of realistic
datasets. Organizations are reluctant to share such data, even internally, due
to privacy reasons. An alternative is to use synthetically generated data but
existing methods are limited in their ability to capture complex dependency
structures, between attributes and across time. This paper presents STAN
(Synthetic network Traffic generation with Autoregressive Neural models), a
tool to generate realistic synthetic network traffic datasets for subsequent
downstream applications. Our novel neural architecture captures both temporal
dependencies and dependence between attributes at any given time. It integrates
convolutional neural layers with mixture density neural layers and softmax
layers, and models both continuous and discrete variables. We evaluate the
performance of STAN in terms of the quality of data generated, by training it
on both a simulated dataset and a real network traffic data set. Finally, to
answer the question - can real network traffic data be substituted with
synthetic data to train models of comparable accuracy? We train two anomaly
detection models based on self-supervision. The results show only a small
decline in the accuracy of models trained solely on synthetic data. While
current results are encouraging in terms of quality of data generated and
absence of any obvious data leakage from training data, in the future we plan
to further validate this fact by conducting privacy attacks on the generated
data. Other future work includes validating capture of long term dependencies
and making model training]]></summary>

(RPNN) for the solution of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) with a focus
on stiff problems. In particular, we use an Extreme Learning Machine, a
single-hidden layer Feedforward Neural Network with Radial Basis Functions
which widths are uniformly distributed random variables, while the values of
the weights between the input and the hidden layer are set equal to one. The
numerical solution is obtained by constructing a system of nonlinear algebraic
equations, which is solved with respect to the output weights using the
Gauss-Newton method. For our illustrations, we apply the proposed machine
learning approach to solve two benchmark stiff problems, namely the Rober and
the van der Pol ones (the latter with large values of the stiffness parameter),
and we perform a comparison with well-established methods such as the adaptive
Runge-Kutta method based on the Dormand-Prince pair, and a variable-step
variable-order multistep solver based on numerical differentiation formulas, as
implemented in the \texttt{ode45} and \texttt{ode15s} MATLAB functions,
respectively. We show that our proposed scheme yields good numerical
approximation accuracy without being affected by the stiffness, thus
outperforming in same cases the \texttt{ode45} and \texttt{ode15s} functions.
Importantly, upon training using a fixed number of collocation points, the
proposed scheme approximates the solution in the whole domain in contrast to
the classical time integration methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[E-commerce sites strive to provide users the most timely relevant information
in order to reduce shopping frictions and increase customer satisfaction. Multi
armed bandit models (MAB) as a type of adaptive optimization algorithms provide
possible approaches for such purposes. In this paper, we analyze using three
classic MAB algorithms, epsilon-greedy, Thompson sampling (TS), and upper
confidence bound 1 (UCB1) for dynamic content recommendations, and walk through
the process of developing these algorithms internally to solve a real world
e-commerce use case. First, we analyze the three MAB algorithms using simulated
purchasing datasets with non-stationary reward distributions to simulate the
possible time-varying customer preferences, where the traffic allocation
dynamics and the accumulative rewards of different algorithms are studied.
Second, we compare the accumulative rewards of the three MAB algorithms with
more than 1,000 trials using actual historical A/B test datasets. We find that
the larger difference between the success rates of competing recommendations
the more accumulative rewards the MAB algorithms can achieve. In addition, we
find that TS shows the highest average accumulative rewards under different
testing scenarios. Third, we develop a batch-updated MAB algorithm to overcome
the delayed reward issue in e-commerce and enable an online content
optimization on our App homepage. For a state-of-the-art comparison, a real A/B
test among our batch-updated MAB algorithm, a third-party MAB solution, and the
default business logic are conducted. The result shows that our batch-updated
MAB algorithm outperforms the counterparts and achieves 6.13% relative
click-through rate (CTR) increase and 16.1% relative conversion rate (CVR)
increase compared to the default experience, and 2.9% relative CTR increase and
1.4% relative CVR increase compared to the external MAB service.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Noisy labels are commonly found in real-world data, which cause performance
degradation of deep neural networks. Cleaning data manually is labour-intensive
and time-consuming. Previous research mostly focuses on enhancing
classification models against noisy labels, while the robustness of deep metric
learning (DML) against noisy labels remains less well-explored. In this paper,
we bridge this important gap by proposing Probabilistic Ranking-based Instance
Selection with Memory (PRISM) approach for DML. PRISM calculates the
probability of a label being clean, and filters out potentially noisy samples.
Specifically, we propose three methods to calculate this probability: 1)
Average Similarity Method (AvgSim), which calculates the average similarity
between potentially noisy data and clean data; 2) Proxy Similarity Method
(ProxySim), which replaces the centers maintained by AvgSim with the proxies
trained by proxy-based method; and 3) von Mises-Fisher Distribution Similarity
(vMF-Sim), which estimates a von Mises-Fisher distribution for each data class.
With such a design, the proposed approach can deal with challenging DML
situations in which the majority of the samples are noisy. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy dataset show that the
proposed approach achieves up to 8.37% higher Precision@1 compared with the
best performing state-of-the-art baseline approaches, within reasonable
training time.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The compression of deep learning models is of fundamental importance in
deploying such models to edge devices. Incorporating hardware model and
application constraints during compression maximizes the benefits but makes it
specifically designed for one case. Therefore, the compression needs to be
automated. Searching for the optimal compression method parameters is
considered an optimization problem. This article introduces a Multi-Objective
Hardware-Aware Quantization (MOHAQ) method, which considers both hardware
efficiency and inference error as objectives for mixed-precision quantization.
The proposed method makes the evaluation of candidate solutions in a large
search space feasible by relying on two steps. First, post-training
quantization is applied for fast solution evaluation. Second, we propose a
search technique named "beacon-based search" to retrain selected solutions only
in the search space and use them as beacons to know the effect of retraining on
other solutions. To evaluate the optimization potential, we chose a speech
recognition model using the TIMIT dataset. The model is based on Simple
Recurrent Unit (SRU) due to its considerable speedup over other recurrent
units. We applied our method to run on two platforms: SiLago and Bitfusion.
Experimental evaluations showed that SRU can be compressed up to 8x by
post-training quantization without any significant increase in the error and up
to 12x with only a 1.5 percentage point increase in error. On SiLago, the
inference-only search found solutions that achieve 80\% and 64\% of the maximum
possible speedup and energy saving, respectively, with a 0.5 percentage point
increase in the error. On Bitfusion, with a constraint of a small SRAM size,
beacon-based search reduced the error gain of inference-only search by 4
percentage points and increased the possible reached speedup to be 47x compared
to the Bitfusion baseline.]]></summary>

performance. Their predictions, however, are prone to be corrupted by
adversarial examples that are imperceptible to humans. Current efforts to
improve the robustness of neural networks against adversarial examples are
focused on developing robust training methods, which update the weights of a
neural network in a more robust direction. In this work, we take a step beyond
training of the weight parameters and consider the problem of designing an
adversarially robust neural architecture with high intrinsic robustness. We
propose AdvRush, a novel adversarial robustness-aware neural architecture
search algorithm, based upon a finding that independent of the training method,
the intrinsic robustness of a neural network can be represented with the
smoothness of its input loss landscape. Through a regularizer that favors a
candidate architecture with a smoother input loss landscape, AdvRush
successfully discovers an adversarially robust neural architecture. Along with
a comprehensive theoretical motivation for AdvRush, we conduct an extensive
amount of experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of AdvRush on various
benchmark datasets. Notably, on CIFAR-10, AdvRush achieves 55.91% robust
accuracy under FGSM attack after standard training and 50.04% robust accuracy
under AutoAttack after 7-step PGD adversarial training.]]></summary>

with other state-of-the-art airway segmentation methods, including relevant

show that our method can extract highly complete airway trees with few false

that the method generalizes well across different datasets. On the EXACT'09

estimation, what spatial dependencies they capture to localize keypoints
remains unclear. In this work, we propose a model called \textbf{TransPose},
which introduces Transformer for human pose estimation. The attention layers
built in Transformer enable our model to capture long-range relationships
efficiently and also can reveal what dependencies the predicted keypoints rely
on. To predict keypoint heatmaps, the last attention layer acts as an
aggregator, which collects contributions from image clues and forms maximum
positions of keypoints. Such a heatmap-based localization approach via
Transformer conforms to the principle of Activation
Maximization~\cite{erhan2009visualizing}. And the revealed dependencies are
image-specific and fine-grained, which also can provide evidence of how the
model handles special cases, e.g., occlusion. The experiments show that
TransPose achieves 75.8 AP and 75.0 AP on COCO validation and test-dev sets,
while being more lightweight and faster than mainstream CNN architectures. The
TransPose model also transfers very well on MPII benchmark, achieving superior
performance on the test set when fine-tuned with small training costs. Code and
pre-trained models are publicly
available\footnote{\url{https://github.com/yangsenius/TransPose}}.]]></summary>

navigate to an object instance in an unseen environment. Prior works have shown
that end-to-end ObjectNav agents that use vanilla visual and recurrent modules,
e.g. a CNN+RNN, perform poorly due to overfitting and sample inefficiency. This
has motivated current state-of-the-art methods to mix analytic and learned
components and operate on explicit spatial maps of the environment. We instead
re-enable a generic learned agent by adding auxiliary learning tasks and an
exploration reward. Our agents achieve 24.5% success and 8.1% SPL, a 37% and 8%
relative improvement over prior state-of-the-art, respectively, on the Habitat
ObjectNav Challenge. From our analysis, we propose that agents will act to
simplify their visual inputs so as to smooth their RNN dynamics, and that
auxiliary tasks reduce overfitting by minimizing effective RNN dimensionality;
i.e. a performant ObjectNav agent that must maintain coherent plans over long

applications. However, it is difficult to tell beforehand if a DNN receiving an
input will deliver the correct output since their decision criteria are usually
nontransparent. A DNN delivers the correct output if the input is within the
area enclosed by its generalization envelope. In this case, the information
contained in the input sample is processed reasonably by the network. It is of
large practical importance to assess at inference time if a DNN generalizes
correctly. Currently, the approaches to achieve this goal are investigated in
different problem set-ups rather independently from one another, leading to
three main research and literature fields: predictive uncertainty,
out-of-distribution detection and adversarial example detection. This survey
connects the three fields within the larger framework of investigating the
generalization performance of machine learning methods and in particular DNNs.
We underline the common ground, point at the most promising approaches and give
a structured overview of the methods that provide at inference time means to
establish if the current input is within the generalization envelope of a DNN.]]></summary>

with different resources, where the resource constraint and task of interest
corresponding to a group of classes are dynamically specified at testing time.
Previous NAS approaches seek to design architectures for all classes
simultaneously, which may not be optimal for some individual tasks. A
straightforward solution is to search an architecture from scratch for each
deployment scenario, which however is computation-intensive and impractical. To
address this, we present a novel and general framework, called Elastic
Architecture Search (EAS), permitting instant specializations at runtime for
diverse tasks with various resource constraints. To this end, we first propose
to effectively train the over-parameterized network via a task dropout strategy
to disentangle the tasks during training. In this way, the resulting model is
robust to the subsequent task dropping at inference time. Based on the
well-trained over-parameterized network, we then propose an efficient
architecture generator to obtain optimal architectures within a single forward
pass. Experiments on two image classification datasets show that EAS is able to
find more compact networks with better performance while remarkably being
orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art NAS methods. For example, our
proposed EAS finds compact architectures within 0.1 second for 50 deployment
scenarios.]]></summary>

domain to an unlabeled target domain. Some recent works tackle source-free
domain adaptation (SFDA) where only a source pre-trained model is available for
adaptation to the target domain. However, those methods do not consider keeping
source performance which is of high practical value in real world applications.
In this paper, we propose a new domain adaptation paradigm called Generalized
Source-free Domain Adaptation (G-SFDA), where the learned model needs to
perform well on both the target and source domains, with only access to current
unlabeled target data during adaptation. First, we propose local structure
clustering (LSC), aiming to cluster the target features with its semantically
similar neighbors, which successfully adapts the model to the target domain in
the absence of source data. Second, we propose sparse domain attention (SDA),
it produces a binary domain specific attention to activate different feature
channels for different domains, meanwhile the domain attention will be utilized
to regularize the gradient during adaptation to keep source information. In the
experiments, for target performance our method is on par with or better than
existing DA and SFDA methods, specifically it achieves state-of-the-art
performance (85.4%) on VisDA, and our method works well for all domains after
adapting to single or multiple target domains. Code is available in

track duration due to the target's trajectory and dynamic interference.
Adapting the radar's waveform using partial information about the state of the

correlation, allowing memory-based learning algorithms to effectively learn
waveform selection strategies. This work examines a radar system which builds a
compressed model of the radar-environment interface in the form of a
context-tree. The radar uses this context tree-based model to select waveforms
in a signal-dependent target channel, which may respond adversarially to the
radar's strategy. This approach is guaranteed to asymptotically converge to the
average-cost optimal policy for any stationary target channel that can be
represented as a Markov process of order U < $\infty$, where the constant U is

sequential processing of data, slowing real-time applications such as
brain-computer interfaces. Here we introduce the Neural Data Transformer (NDT),

dynamical systems by applying it to synthetic datasets with known dynamics and
data from monkey motor cortex during a reaching task well-modeled by RNNs. The
NDT models these datasets as well as state-of-the-art recurrent models.
Further, its non-recurrence enables 3.9ms inference, well within the loop time
of real-time applications and more than 6 times faster than recurrent baselines
on the monkey reaching dataset. These results suggest that an explicit dynamics

directly impact the affected corridors' traffic safety and operational
conditions. The recent emergence of cloud-based quantum computing
infrastructure and innovations in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices have
revealed a new era of quantum-enhanced algorithms that can be leveraged to
improve real-time incident detection accuracy. In this research, a hybrid
machine learning model, which includes classical and quantum machine learning
(ML) models, is developed to identify incidents using the connected vehicle
(CV) data. The incident detection performance of the hybrid model is evaluated
against baseline classical ML models. The framework is evaluated using data
from a microsimulation tool for different incident scenarios. The results
indicate that a hybrid neural network containing a 4-qubit quantum layer
outperforms all other baseline models when there is a lack of training data. We
have created three datasets; DS-1 with sufficient training data, and DS-2 and
DS-3 with insufficient training data. The hybrid model achieves a recall of
98.9%, 98.3%, and 96.6% for DS-1, DS-2, and DS-3, respectively. For DS-2 and
DS-3, the average improvement in F2-score (measures model's performance to
correctly identify incidents) achieved by the hybrid model is 1.9% and 7.8%,
respectively, compared to the classical models. It shows that with insufficient
data, which may be common for CVs, the hybrid ML model will perform better than

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial Neural Networks (NN) are widely used for solving complex problems
from medical diagnostics to face recognition. Despite notable successes, the
main disadvantages of NN are also well known: the risk of overfitting, lack of
explainability (inability to extract algorithms from trained NN), and high
consumption of computing resources. Determining the appropriate specific NN
structure for each problem can help overcome these difficulties: Too poor NN
cannot be successfully trained, but too rich NN gives unexplainable results and
may have a high chance of overfitting. Reducing precision of NN parameters
simplifies the implementation of these NN, saves computing resources, and makes
the NN skills more transparent. This paper lists the basic NN simplification
problems and controlled pruning procedures to solve these problems. All the
described pruning procedures can be implemented in one framework. The developed
procedures, in particular, find the optimal structure of NN for each task,
measure the influence of each input signal and NN parameter, and provide a
detailed verbal description of the algorithms and skills of NN. The described
methods are illustrated by a simple example: the generation of explicit
algorithms for predicting the results of the US presidential election.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soft spelling errors are a class of spelling mistakes that is widespread
among native Arabic speakers and foreign learners alike. Some of these errors
are typographical in nature. They occur due to orthographic variations of some
Arabic letters and the complex rules that dictate their correct usage. Many
people forgo these rules, and given the identical phonetic sounds, they often
confuse such letters. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional long short-term
memory network that corrects this class of errors. We develop, train, evaluate,
and compare a set of BiLSTM networks. We approach the spelling correction
problem at the character level. We handle Arabic texts from both classical and
modern standard Arabic. We treat the problem as a one-to-one sequence
transcription problem. Since the soft Arabic errors class encompasses omission
and addition mistakes, to preserve the one-to-one sequence transcription, we
propose a simple low-resource yet effective technique that maintains the
one-to-one sequencing and avoids using a costly encoder-decoder architecture.
We train the BiLSTM models to correct the spelling mistakes using transformed
input and stochastic error injection approaches. We recommend a configuration
that has two BiLSTM layers, uses the dropout regularization, and is trained
using the latter training approach with error injection rate of 40%. The best
model corrects 96.4% of the injected errors and achieves a low character error
rate of 1.28% on a real test set of soft spelling mistakes.]]></summary>

and connected infrastructure, are vulnerable to cyberattacks that can instantly
compromise the safety of the vehicle itself and other connected vehicles and
roadway infrastructure. One such cyberattack is the false information attack,
where an external attacker injects inaccurate information into the connected
vehicles and eventually can cause catastrophic consequences by compromising
safety-critical applications like the forward collision warning. The occurrence
and target of such attack events can be very dynamic, making real-time and
near-real-time detection challenging. Change point models, can be used for
real-time anomaly detection caused by the false information attack. In this
paper, we have evaluated three change point-based statistical models;
Expectation Maximization, Cumulative Summation, and Bayesian Online Change
Point Algorithms for cyberattack detection in the CV data. Also, data-driven
artificial intelligence (AI) models, which can be used to detect known and
unknown underlying patterns in the dataset, have the potential of detecting a
real-time anomaly in the CV data. We have used six AI models to detect false
information attacks and compared the performance for detecting the attacks with
our developed change point models. Our study shows that change points models
performed better in real-time false information attack detection compared to
the performance of the AI models. Change point models having the advantage of
no training requirements can be a feasible and computationally efficient
alternative to AI models for false information attack detection in connected
vehicles.]]></summary>

single-criterion optimization problems. In contrast, for multiple-criteria
optimization there are significantly fewer approaches despite the existence of
numerous applications. Constrained path-planning for Autonomous Ground Vehicles
(AGV) is one such application, where an AGV is typically deployed in disaster
relief or search and rescue applications in off-road environments. The agent
can be faced with the following dilemma : optimize a source-destination path
according to a known criterion and an uncertain criterion under operational
constraints. The known criterion is associated to the cost of the path,
representing the distance. The uncertain criterion represents the feasibility
of driving through the path without requiring human intervention. It depends on
various external parameters such as the physics of the vehicle, the state of
the explored terrains or weather conditions. In this work, we leverage
knowledge acquired through offline simulations by training a neural network
model to predict the uncertain criterion. We integrate this model inside a
path-planner which can solve problems online. Finally, we conduct experiments
on realistic AGV scenarios which illustrate that the proposed framework
requires human intervention less frequently, trading for a limited increase in
the path distance.]]></summary>

white box adversarial attacks on these hybrid models. The classical part of
hybrid models includes a convolution network from the pre-trained Resnet18
model, which extracts informative features from a high dimensional LISA traffic
sign image dataset. The output from the classical processor is processed
further through the quantum layer, which is composed of various quantum gates
and provides support to various quantum mechanical features like entanglement
and superposition. We have tested multiple combinations of quantum circuits to
provide better classification accuracy with decreasing training data and found
better resiliency for our hybrid classical-quantum deep learning model during

source data are available in the training phase. However, in many real-world
scenarios, owing to some reasons such as privacy protection and information
security, the source data is inaccessible, and only a model trained on the
source domain is available. This paper proposes a novel deep clustering method
for this challenging task. Aiming at the dynamical clustering at feature-level,
we introduce extra constraints hidden in the geometric structure between data
to assist the process. Concretely, we propose a geometry-based constraint,
named semantic consistency on the nearest neighborhood (SCNNH), and use it to
encourage robust clustering. To reach this goal, we construct the nearest
neighborhood for every target data and take it as the fundamental clustering
unit by building our objective on the geometry. Also, we develop a more
SCNNH-compliant structure with an additional semantic credibility constraint,
named semantic hyper-nearest neighborhood (SHNNH). After that, we extend our
method to this new geometry. Extensive experiments on three challenging UDA
datasets indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. The
proposed method has significant improvement on all datasets (as we adopt SHNNH,
the average accuracy increases by over 3.0% on the large-scaled dataset). Code

(GNNs) for semi-supervised learning tasks. Unfortunately this work has assumed
that the nodes labeled for use in training were selected uniformly at random
(i.e. are an IID sample). However in many real world scenarios gathering labels
for graph nodes is both expensive and inherently biased -- so this assumption
can not be met. GNNs can suffer poor generalization when this occurs, by
overfitting to superfluous regularities present in the training data. In this
work we present a method, Shift-Robust GNN (SR-GNN), designed to account for
distributional differences between biased training data and the graph's true
inference distribution. SR-GNN adapts GNN models for the presence of
distributional shifts between the nodes which have had labels provided for
training and the rest of the dataset. We illustrate the effectiveness of SR-GNN
in a variety of experiments with biased training datasets on common GNN
benchmark datasets for semi-supervised learning, where we see that SR-GNN
outperforms other GNN baselines by accuracy, eliminating at least (~40%) of the
negative effects introduced by biased training data. On the largest dataset we

models often exploit dataset biases for the final decision without considering
the image information. As a result, they suffer from performance drop on
out-of-distribution data and inadequate visual explanation. Based on
experimental analysis for existing robust VQA methods, we stress the language
bias in VQA that comes from two aspects, i.e., distribution bias and shortcut
bias. We further propose a new de-bias framework, Greedy Gradient Ensemble
(GGE), which combines multiple biased models for unbiased base model learning.
With the greedy strategy, GGE forces the biased models to over-fit the biased
data distribution in priority, thus makes the base model pay more attention to
examples that are hard to solve by biased models. The experiments demonstrate
that our method makes better use of visual information and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on diagnosing dataset VQA-CP without using extra

well understood. It is not suitable for use with very small mini-batch sizes or
online learning. In this paper, we propose a new method called Batch
Normalization Preconditioning (BNP). Instead of applying normalization
explicitly through a batch normalization layer as is done in BN, BNP applies
normalization by conditioning the parameter gradients directly during training.
This is designed to improve the Hessian matrix of the loss function and hence
convergence during training. One benefit is that BNP is not constrained on the
mini-batch size and works in the online learning setting. Furthermore, its
connection to BN provides theoretical insights on how BN improves training and
how BN is applied to special architectures such as convolutional neural
networks.]]></summary>

unpredictability when dealing with flammable or hazardous materials so that
detection of fire accidents by itself may not be enough. An example of this is
the impingement of jet fires, where the heat fluxes of the flame could reach
nearby equipment and dramatically increase the probability of a domino effect
with catastrophic results. Because of this, the characterization of such fire
accidents is important from a risk management point of view. One such
characterization would be the segmentation of different radiation zones within
the flame, so this paper presents an exploratory research regarding several
traditional computer vision and Deep Learning segmentation approaches to solve
this specific problem. A data set of propane jet fires is used to train and
evaluate the different approaches and given the difference in the distribution
of the zones and background of the images, different loss functions, that seek
to alleviate data imbalance, are also explored. Additionally, different metrics
are correlated to a manual ranking performed by experts to make an evaluation
that closely resembles the expert's criteria. The Hausdorff Distance and
Adjusted Random Index were the metrics with the highest correlation and the
best results were obtained from the UNet architecture with a Weighted
Cross-Entropy Loss. These results can be used in future research to extract
more geometric information from the segmentation masks or could even be
implemented on other types of fire accidents.]]></summary>

vision. Due to immense variability in scanners' parameters and imaging
protocols, even images obtained from the same person and the same scanner could
differ significantly. We address variability in computed tomography (CT) images
caused by different convolution kernels used in the reconstruction process, the
critical domain shift factor in CT. The choice of a convolution kernel affects
pixels' granularity, image smoothness, and noise level. We analyze a dataset of
paired CT images, where smooth and sharp images were reconstructed from the
same sinograms with different kernels, thus providing identical anatomy but
different style. Though identical predictions are desired, we show that the
consistency, measured as the average Dice between predictions on pairs, is just
0.54. We propose Filtered Back-Projection Augmentation (FBPAug), a simple and
surprisingly efficient approach to augment CT images in sinogram space
emulating reconstruction with different kernels. We apply the proposed method
in a zero-shot domain adaptation setup and show that the consistency boosts
from 0.54 to 0.92 outperforming other augmentation approaches. Neither specific
preparation of source domain data nor target domain data is required, so our
publicly released FBPAug can be used as a plug-and-play module for zero-shot
domain adaptation in any CT-based task.]]></summary>

domain (source) does not perform well when exposed to samples from a different
domain (target). Unsupervised methods that can adapt to domain shift are highly
desirable as they allow effective utilization of the source data without
requiring additional annotated training data from the target. Practically,
obtaining sufficient amount of annotated data from the target domain can be
both infeasible and extremely expensive. In this work, we address the domain
shift problem for the object detection task. Our approach relies on gradually
removing the domain shift between the source and the target domains. The key
ingredients to our approach are -- (a) mapping the source to the target domain
on pixel-level; (b) training a teacher network on the mapped source and the
unannotated target domain using adversarial feature alignment; and (c) finally
training a student network using the pseudo-labels obtained from the teacher.
Experimentally, when tested on challenging scenarios involving domain shift, we
consistently obtain significantly large performance gains over various recent
state of the art approaches.]]></summary>

features from images for enabling detection of a vast amount of object types.
However, utilization of such backbones in object detection applications
developed for specific object types can unnecessarily over-process an extensive
amount of background. In addition, they are agnostic to object scales, thus
redundantly process all image regions at the same resolution. In this work we
introduce BLT-net, a new low-computation two-stage object detection
architecture designed to process images with a significant amount of background
and objects of variate scales. BLT-net reduces computations by separating
objects from background using a very lite first-stage. BLT-net then efficiently
merges obtained proposals to further decrease processed background and then
dynamically reduces their resolution to minimize computations. Resulting image
proposals are then processed in the second-stage by a highly accurate model. We
demonstrate our architecture on the pedestrian detection problem, where objects
are of different sizes, images are of high resolution and object detection is
required to run in real-time. We show that our design reduces computations by a
factor of x4-x7 on the Citypersons and Caltech datasets with respect to leading
pedestrian detectors, on account of a small accuracy degradation. This method
can be applied on other object detection applications in scenes with a
considerable amount of background and variate object sizes to reduce

clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) to detect the robots and a

move in an indoor arena. Robust detections and tracks are maintained in the
face of event camera noise and lack of events (due to robots moving slowly or
stopping). An off-the-shelf RGB camera-based tracking system was used to
provide ground truth. Experiments including up to 4 robots are performed to
study the effect of i) varying DBSCAN parameters, ii) the event accumulation
time, iii) the number of robots in the arena, iv) the speed of the robots, and
v) variation in ambient light conditions on the detection and tracking
performance. The experimental results showed 100% detection and tracking

the technological developments in automation and computational intelligence
applied to the agricultural sector, including vineyards which are a relevant
crop in the Mediterranean region. In this paper, a study of semantic
segmentation for vine detection in real-world vineyards is presented by
exploring state-of-the-art deep segmentation networks and conventional
unsupervised methods. Camera data was collected on vineyards using an Unmanned
Aerial System (UAS) equipped with a dual imaging sensor payload, namely a
high-resolution color camera and a five-band multispectral and thermal camera.
Extensive experiments of the segmentation networks and unsupervised methods
have been performed on multimodal datasets representing three distinct
vineyards located in the central region of Portugal. The reported results
indicate that the best segmentation performances are obtained with deep
networks, while traditional (non-deep) approaches using the NIR band shown
competitive results. The results also show that multimodality slightly improves
the performance of vine segmentation but the NIR spectrum alone generally is
sufficient on most of the datasets. The code and dataset are publicly available

low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral image and a low-spectral-resolution
multispectral image. In this regard, compressive spectral imaging (CSI) has
emerged as an acquisition framework that captures the relevant information of
spectral images using a reduced number of measurements. Recently, various image
fusion methods from CSI measurements have been proposed. However, these methods
exhibit high running times and face the challenging task of choosing
sparsity-inducing bases. In this paper, a deep network under the algorithm
unrolling approach is proposed for fusing spectral images from compressive
measurements. This architecture, dubbed LADMM-Net, casts each iteration of a
linearized version of the alternating direction method of multipliers into a
processing layer whose concatenation deploys a deep network. The linearized
approach enables obtaining fusion estimates without resorting to costly matrix
inversions. Furthermore, this approach exploits the benefits of learnable
transforms to estimate the image details included in both the auxiliary
variable and the Lagrange multiplier. Finally, the performance of the proposed
technique is evaluated on two spectral image databases and one dataset captured
at the laboratory. Extensive simulations show that the proposed method
outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches that fuse spectral images from
compressive measurements.]]></summary>

supervision is an important problem in computer vision. However, despite its
significance, this problem remains rather unexplored, with a few exceptions
that considered unsupervised semantic segmentation on small-scale datasets with
a narrow visual domain. In this paper, we make a first attempt to tackle the
problem on datasets that have been traditionally utilized for the supervised
case. To achieve this, we introduce a two-step framework that adopts a
predetermined mid-level prior in a contrastive optimization objective to learn
pixel embeddings. This marks a large deviation from existing works that relied
on proxy tasks or end-to-end clustering. Additionally, we argue about the
importance of having a prior that contains information about objects, or their
parts, and discuss several possibilities to obtain such a prior in an
unsupervised manner.

Experimental evaluation shows that our method comes with key advantages over
existing works. First, the learned pixel embeddings can be directly clustered
in semantic groups using K-Means on PASCAL. Under the fully unsupervised
setting, there is no precedent in solving the semantic segmentation task on
such a challenging benchmark. Second, our representations can improve over
strong baselines when transferred to new datasets, e.g. COCO and DAVIS. The
code is available.]]></summary>

use-cases. Despite the difficulty of detecting kinship, annual data challenges
using still-images have consistently improved performances and attracted new
researchers. Now, systems reach performance levels unforeseeable a decade ago,
closing in on performances acceptable to deploy in practice. Similar to other
biometric tasks, we expect systems can benefit from additional modalities. We
hypothesize that adding modalities to FIW, which contains only still-images,
will improve performance. Thus, to narrow the gap between research and reality
and enhance the power of kinship recognition systems, we extend FIW with
multimedia (MM) data (i.e., video, audio, and text captions). Specifically, we
introduce the first publicly available multi-task MM kinship dataset. To build
FIW MM, we developed machinery to automatically collect, annotate, and prepare
the data, requiring minimal human input and no financial cost. The proposed MM
corpus allows the problem statements to be more realistic template-based
protocols. We show significant improvements in all benchmarks with the added
modalities. The results highlight edge cases to inspire future research with
different areas of improvement. FIW MM provides the data required to increase
the potential of automated systems to detect kinship in MM. It also allows
experts from diverse fields to collaborate in novel ways.]]></summary>

estimate people densities in individual images. As such, only very few take
advantage of temporal consistency in video sequences, and those that do only
impose weak smoothness constraints across consecutive frames. In this paper, we
advocate estimating people flows across image locations between consecutive
images and inferring the people densities from these flows instead of directly
regressing them. This enables us to impose much stronger constraints encoding
the conservation of the number of people. As a result, it significantly boosts
performance without requiring a more complex architecture. Furthermore, it
allows us to exploit the correlation between people flow and optical flow to
further improve the results. We also show that leveraging people conservation
constraints in both a spatial and temporal manner makes it possible to train a
deep crowd counting model in an active learning setting with much fewer
annotations. This significantly reduces the annotation cost while still leading
to similar performance to the full supervision case.]]></summary>

We design and implement an extensible, configurable, and flexible benchmark

the computational graph of a neural network has to fit into the in-computation

research area in early diagnosis of some neurodegenerative diseases (e.g.
Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, etc.) for elderly people or brain
underdevelopment for the young group. Deep learning methods have achieved the
state-of-the-art performance in many medical image analysis tasks, including
brain age estimation. However, the performance and generalisability of the deep
learning model are highly dependent on the quantity and quality of the training
data set. Both collecting and annotating brain MRI data are extremely
time-consuming. In this paper, to overcome the data scarcity problem, we
propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based image synthesis method.
Different from the existing GAN-based methods, we integrate a task-guided
branch (a regression model for age estimation) to the end of the generator in
GAN. By adding a task-guided loss to the conventional GAN loss, the learned
low-dimensional latent space and the synthesised images are more task-specific.
It helps to boost the performance of the down-stream task by combining the
synthesised images and real images for model training. The proposed method was
evaluated on a public brain MRI data set for age estimation. Our proposed
method outperformed (statistically significant) a deep convolutional neural
network based regression model and the GAN-based image synthesis method without
the task-guided branch. More importantly, it enables the identification of
age-related brain regions in the image space. The code is available on GitHub

disease in over 200 countries, influencing billions of humans. To control the
infection, identifying and separating the infected people is the most crucial
step. The main diagnostic tool is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Still, the sensitivity of the RT-PCR test is not high
enough to effectively prevent the pandemic. The chest CT scan test provides a
valuable complementary tool to the RT-PCR test, and it can identify the
patients in the early-stage with high sensitivity. However, the chest CT scan
test is usually time-consuming, requiring about 21.5 minutes per case. This
paper develops a novel Joint Classification and Segmentation (JCS) system to
perform real-time and explainable COVID-19 chest CT diagnosis. To train our JCS
system, we construct a large scale COVID-19 Classification and Segmentation
(COVID-CS) dataset, with 144,167 chest CT images of 400 COVID-19 patients and
350 uninfected cases. 3,855 chest CT images of 200 patients are annotated with
fine-grained pixel-level labels of opacifications, which are increased
attenuation of the lung parenchyma. We also have annotated lesion counts,
opacification areas, and locations and thus benefit various diagnosis aspects.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed JCS diagnosis system is
very efficient for COVID-19 classification and segmentation. It obtains an
average sensitivity of 95.0% and a specificity of 93.0% on the classification
test set, and 78.5% Dice score on the segmentation test set of our COVID-CS
dataset. The COVID-CS dataset and code are available at

hematologists to analyze RBC lab results in a reduced time and cost. However,
overlapping cells can cause incorrect predicted results, and so they have to be
separated into multiple single RBCs before classifying. To classify multiple
classes with deep learning, imbalance problems are common in medical imaging
because normal samples are always higher than rare disease samples. This paper
presents a new method to segment and classify RBCs from blood smear images,
specifically to tackle cell overlapping and data imbalance problems. Focusing
on overlapping cell separation, our segmentation process first estimates
ellipses to represent RBCs. The method detects the concave points and then
finds the ellipses using directed ellipse fitting. The accuracy from 20 blood
smear images was 0.889. Classification requires balanced training datasets.
However, some RBC types are rare. The imbalance ratio of this dataset was
34.538 for 12 RBC classes from 20,875 individual RBC samples. The use of
machine learning for RBC classification with an imbalanced dataset is hence
more challenging than many other applications. We analyzed techniques to deal
with this problem. The best accuracy and F1-score were 0.921 and 0.8679,
respectively, using EfficientNet-B1 with augmentation. Experimental results
showed that the weight balancing technique with augmentation had the potential
to deal with imbalance problems by improving the F1-score on minority classes,
while data augmentation significantly improved the overall classification
performance.]]></summary>

quantitative analysis of the stresses in granular materials. Over the last two
decades, computational methods for reconstructing forces between particles from
their photoelastic response have been developed by many different experimental
teams. Unfortunately, all of these methods are computationally expensive. This
limits their use for processing extensive data sets that capture the time
evolution of granular ensembles consisting of a large number of particles. In
this paper, we present a novel approach to this problem which leverages the
power of convolutional neural networks to recognize complex spatial patterns.
The main drawback of using neural networks is that training them usually
requires a large labeled data set which is hard to obtain experimentally. We
show that this problem can be successfully circumvented by pretraining the
networks on a large synthetic data set and then fine-tuning them on much
smaller experimental data sets. Due to our current lack of experimental data,
we demonstrate the potential of our method by changing the size of the
considered particles which alters the exhibited photoelastic patterns more than
typical experimental errors.]]></summary>

approximate episode sampling distributions based on their difficulty. Building
on this method, we perform an extensive analysis and find that sampling
uniformly over episode difficulty outperforms other sampling schemes, including
curriculum and easy-/hard-mining. As the proposed sampling method is algorithm

biometric approach to establish the identity of individuals. However, matching
iris images acquired at different spectral bands (i.e., matching a visible
(VIS) iris probe to a gallery of near-infrared (NIR) iris images or vice versa)
shows a significant performance degradation when compared to intraband NIR
matching. Hence, in this paper, we have investigated a range of deep
convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) architectures to further
improve the accuracy of cross-spectral iris recognition methods. Moreover,
unlike the existing works in the literature, we introduce a resolution
difference into the classical cross-spectral matching problem domain. We have
developed two different techniques using the conditional generative adversarial
network (cGAN) as a backbone architecture for cross-spectral iris matching. In
the first approach, we simultaneously address the cross-resolution and
cross-spectral matching problem by training a cGAN that jointly translates
cross-resolution as well as cross-spectral tasks to the same resolution and
within the same spectrum. In the second approach, we design a coupled
generative adversarial network (cpGAN) architecture consisting of a pair of
cGAN modules that project the VIS and NIR iris images into a low-dimensional
embedding domain to ensure maximum pairwise similarity between the feature
vectors from the two iris modalities of the same subject.]]></summary>

mitigate the common shortcomings by following four design principles:
decoupling the OOD detection from the segmentation task, observing the entire
segmentation network instead of just its output, generating training data for
the OOD detector by leveraging blind spots in the segmentation network and
focusing the generated data on localized regions in the image to simulate OOD
objects. Our main contribution is a new OOD detection architecture called
ObsNet associated with a dedicated training scheme based on Local Adversarial

ablation studies. We also show it obtains top performances both in speed and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The quality of images captured by smartphones is an important specification
since smartphones are becoming ubiquitous as primary capturing devices. The
traditional image signal processing (ISP) pipeline in a smartphone camera
consists of several image processing steps performed sequentially to
reconstruct a high quality sRGB image from the raw sensor data. These steps
consist of demosaicing, denoising, white balancing, gamma correction, colour
enhancement, etc. Since each of them are performed sequentially using
hand-crafted algorithms, the residual error from each processing module
accumulates in the final reconstructed signal. Thus, the traditional ISP
pipeline has limited reconstruction quality in terms of generalizability across
different lighting conditions and associated noise levels while capturing the
image. Deep learning methods using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have
become popular in solving many image-related tasks such as image denoising,
contrast enhancement, super resolution, deblurring, etc. Furthermore, recent
approaches for the RAW to sRGB conversion using deep learning methods have also
been published, however, their immense complexity in terms of their memory
requirement and number of Mult-Adds make them unsuitable for mobile camera ISP.
In this paper we propose DelNet - a single end-to-end deep learning model - to
learn the entire ISP pipeline within reasonable complexity for smartphone
deployment. Del-Net is a multi-scale architecture that uses spatial and channel
attention to capture global features like colour, as well as a series of
lightweight modified residual attention blocks to help with denoising. For
validation, we provide results to show the proposed Del-Net achieves compelling
reconstruction quality.]]></summary>

into a reference person under diverse human poses. Previous works focus on
preserving clothing details ( e.g., texture, logos, patterns ) when
transferring desired clothes onto a target person under a fixed pose. However,
the performances of existing methods significantly dropped when extending
existing methods to multi-pose virtual try-on. In this paper, we propose an
end-to-end Semantic Prediction Guidance multi-pose Virtual Try-On Network
(SPG-VTON), which could fit the desired clothing into a reference person under
arbitrary poses. Concretely, SPG-VTON is composed of three sub-modules. First,
a Semantic Prediction Module (SPM) generates the desired semantic map. The
predicted semantic map provides more abundant guidance to locate the desired
clothes region and produce a coarse try-on image. Second, a Clothes Warping
Module (CWM) warps in-shop clothes to the desired shape according to the
predicted semantic map and the desired pose. Specifically, we introduce a
conductible cycle consistency loss to alleviate the misalignment in the clothes
warping process. Third, a Try-on Synthesis Module (TSM) combines the coarse
result and the warped clothes to generate the final virtual try-on image,
preserving details of the desired clothes and under the desired pose. Besides,
we introduce a face identity loss to refine the facial appearance and maintain
the identity of the final virtual try-on result at the same time. We evaluate
the proposed method on the most massive multi-pose dataset (MPV) and the
DeepFashion dataset. The qualitative and quantitative experiments show that
SPG-VTON is superior to the state-of-the-art methods and is robust to the data
noise, including background and accessory changes, i.e., hats and handbags,
showing good scalability to the real-world scenario.]]></summary>

there is a change in data distribution between training and test domains. When
the aim is to make predictions on distributions different from those seen at

issue learn a model using data from multiple source domains, and then apply
this model to the unseen target domain. Our hypothesis is that when training
with multiple domains, conflicting gradients within each mini-batch contain
information specific to the individual domains which is irrelevant to the
others, including the test domain. If left untouched, such disagreement may
degrade generalization performance. In this work, we characterize the
conflicting gradients emerging in domain shift scenarios and devise novel
gradient agreement strategies based on gradient surgery to alleviate their
effect. We validate our approach in image classification tasks with three
multi-domain datasets, showing the value of the proposed agreement strategy in

to anthropological investigations. Determining the sex of a footprint can be
useful in screening such impressions and attempts have been made to do so using
single or multi landmark distances, shape analyses and via the density of
friction ridges. Here we explore the relative importance of different
components in sexing two-dimensional foot impressions namely, size, shape and
texture. We use a machine learning approach and compare this to more
traditional methods of discrimination. Two datasets are used, a pilot data set
collected from students at Bournemouth University (N=196) and a larger data set
collected by podiatrists at Sheffield NHS Teaching Hospital (N=2677). Our
convolutional neural network can sex a footprint with accuracy of around 90% on
a test set of N=267 footprint images using all image components, which is
better than an expert can achieve. However, the quality of the impressions
impacts on this success rate, but the results are promising and in time it may
be possible to create an automated screening algorithm in which practitioners
of whatever sort (medical or forensic) can obtain a first order sexing of a
two-dimensional footprint.]]></summary>

softmax-based multi-class classification framework. Despite being popular and
effective, these methods still have a few shortcomings that limit empirical
performance. In this paper, we first identify the discrepancy between training
and evaluation in the existing multi-class classification framework and then
discuss the potential limitations caused by the "competitive" nature of softmax
normalization. Motivated by these limitations, we propose a novel binary
classification training framework, termed SphereFace2. In contrast to existing
methods, SphereFace2 circumvents the softmax normalization, as well as the
corresponding closed-set assumption. This effectively bridges the gap between
training and evaluation, enabling the representations to be improved
individually by each binary classification task. Besides designing a specific
well-performing loss function, we summarize a few general principles for this
"one-vs-all" binary classification framework so that it can outperform current
competitive methods. We conduct comprehensive experiments on popular benchmarks
to demonstrate that SphereFace2 can consistently outperform current
state-of-the-art deep face recognition methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sparse coding has been incorporated in models of the visual cortex for its
computational advantages and connection to biology. But how the level of
sparsity contributes to performance on visual tasks is not well understood. In
this work, sparse coding has been integrated into an existing hierarchical V2
model (Hosoya and Hyv\"arinen, 2015), but replacing the Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) with an explicit sparse coding in which the degree of sparsity
can be controlled. After training, the sparse coding basis functions with a
higher degree of sparsity resembled qualitatively different structures, such as
curves and corners. The contributions of the models were assessed with image
classification tasks, including object classification, and tasks associated
with mid-level vision including figure-ground classification, texture
classification, and angle prediction between two line stimuli. In addition, the
models were assessed in comparison to a texture sensitivity measure that has
been reported in V2 (Freeman et al., 2013), and a deleted-region inference
task. The results from the experiments show that while sparse coding performed
worse than ICA at classifying images, only sparse coding was able to better
match the texture sensitivity level of V2 and infer deleted image regions, both
by increasing the degree of sparsity in sparse coding. Higher degrees of
sparsity allowed for inference over larger deleted image regions. The mechanism
that allows for this inference capability in sparse coding is described here.]]></summary>

heart disease. At present, the methods for detecting coronary artery stenoses
and evaluating the degree of it in coronary angiograms are either subjective or
not efficient enough. Two vascular stenoses detection methods in coronary
angiograms are proposed to assist the diagnosis. The first one is an automatic
method, which can automatically segment the entire coronary vessels and mark
the stenoses. The second one is an interactive method. With this method, the
user only needs to give a start point and an end point to detect the stenoses
of a certain vascular segment. We have shown that the proposed tracking methods
are robust for angiograms with various vessel structure. The automatic
detection method can effectively measure the diameter of the vessel and mark
the stenoses in different angiograms. Further investigation proves that the
results of interactive detection method can accurately reflect the true
stenoses situation. The proposed automatic method and interactive method are
effective in various angiograms and can complement each other in clinical
practice. The first method can be used for preliminary screening and the second
method can be used for further quantitative analysis. It has the potential to
improve the level of clinical diagnosis of coronary heart disease.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weakly-supervised object detection (WSOD) has emerged as an inspiring recent
topic to avoid expensive instance-level object annotations. However, the
bounding boxes of most existing WSOD methods are mainly determined by
precomputed proposals, thereby being limited in precise object localization. In
this paper, we defend the problem setting for improving localization
performance by leveraging the bounding box regression knowledge from a
well-annotated auxiliary dataset. First, we use the well-annotated auxiliary
dataset to explore a series of learnable bounding box adjusters (LBBAs) in a
multi-stage training manner, which is class-agnostic. Then, only LBBAs and a
weakly-annotated dataset with non-overlapped classes are used for training
LBBA-boosted WSOD. As such, our LBBAs are practically more convenient and
economical to implement while avoiding the leakage of the auxiliary
well-annotated dataset. In particular, we formulate learning bounding box
adjusters as a bi-level optimization problem and suggest an EM-like multi-stage
training algorithm. Then, a multi-stage scheme is further presented for
LBBA-boosted WSOD. Additionally, a masking strategy is adopted to improve
proposal classification. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our
method. Our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art WSOD methods and
knowledge transfer model with similar problem setting. Code is publicly

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[High dynamic range (HDR) imaging from multiple low dynamic range (LDR) images
has been suffering from ghosting artifacts caused by scene and objects motion.
Existing methods, such as optical flow based and end-to-end deep learning based
solutions, are error-prone either in detail restoration or ghosting artifacts
removal. Comprehensive empirical evidence shows that ghosting artifacts caused
by large foreground motion are mainly low-frequency signals and the details are
mainly high-frequency signals. In this work, we propose a novel
frequency-guided end-to-end deep neural network (FHDRNet) to conduct HDR fusion
in the frequency domain, and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to
decompose inputs into different frequency bands. The low-frequency signals are
used to avoid specific ghosting artifacts, while the high-frequency signals are
used for preserving details. Using a U-Net as the backbone, we propose two
novel modules: merging module and frequency-guided upsampling module. The
merging module applies the attention mechanism to the low-frequency components
to deal with the ghost caused by large foreground motion. The frequency-guided
upsampling module reconstructs details from multiple frequency-specific
components with rich details. In addition, a new RAW dataset is created for
training and evaluating multi-frame HDR imaging algorithms in the RAW domain.
Extensive experiments are conducted on public datasets and our RAW dataset,
showing that the proposed FHDRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance.]]></summary>

Current diagnostic methods have several limitations leading to the suggestion
of eye-tracking for its diagnosis through in-attention. To ascertain the
requirements for an eye-tracking system in an adult ICU, measurements were
carried out at Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Clinical
criteria guided empirical requirements of invasiveness and calibration methods
while accuracy and precision were measured. A non-invasive system was then
developed utilising a patient-facing RGB-camera and a scene-facing RGBD-camera.
The system's performance was measured in a replicated laboratory environment
with healthy volunteers revealing an accuracy and precision that outperforms
what is required while simultaneously being non-invasive and calibration-free
The system was then deployed as part CONfuSED, a clinical feasibility study
where we report aggregated data from 5 patients as well as the acceptability of
the system to bedside nursing staff. The system is the first eye-tracking

In this work, we explore the use of nnU-Net as a fully automated tool for
microbleed segmentation. Data was provided by the ``Where is VALDO?'' challenge
of MICCAI 2021. The final method consists of nnU-Net in the ``3D full
resolution U-Net'' configuration trained on all data (fold = `all'). No
post-processing options of nnU-Net were used. Self-evaluation on the training
data showed an estimated Dice of 0.80, false discovery rate of 0.16, and false
negative rate of 0.15. Final evaluation on the test set of the VALDO challenge
is pending. Visual inspection of the results showed that most of the reported
false positives could be an actual microbleed that might have been missed

degradation of deep neural networks. Cleaning data manually is labour-intensive
and time-consuming. Previous research mostly focuses on enhancing
classification models against noisy labels, while the robustness of deep metric
learning (DML) against noisy labels remains less well-explored. In this paper,
we bridge this important gap by proposing Probabilistic Ranking-based Instance
Selection with Memory (PRISM) approach for DML. PRISM calculates the
probability of a label being clean, and filters out potentially noisy samples.
Specifically, we propose three methods to calculate this probability: 1)
Average Similarity Method (AvgSim), which calculates the average similarity
between potentially noisy data and clean data; 2) Proxy Similarity Method
(ProxySim), which replaces the centers maintained by AvgSim with the proxies
trained by proxy-based method; and 3) von Mises-Fisher Distribution Similarity
(vMF-Sim), which estimates a von Mises-Fisher distribution for each data class.
With such a design, the proposed approach can deal with challenging DML
situations in which the majority of the samples are noisy. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy dataset show that the
proposed approach achieves up to 8.37% higher Precision@1 compared with the
best performing state-of-the-art baseline approaches, within reasonable

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We propose Region-wise (RW) loss for biomedical image segmentation.
Region-wise loss is versatile, can simultaneously account for class imbalance
and pixel importance, and it can be easily implemented as the pixel-wise
multiplication between the softmax output and a RW map. We show that, under the
proposed Region-wise loss framework, certain loss functions, such as Active
Contour and Boundary loss, can be reformulated similarly with appropriate RW
maps, thus revealing their underlying similarities and a new perspective to
understand these loss functions. We investigate the observed optimization
instability caused by certain RW maps, such as Boundary loss distance maps, and
we introduce a mathematically-grounded principle to avoid such instability.
This principle provides excellent adaptability to any dataset and practically
ensures convergence without extra regularization terms or optimization tricks.
Following this principle, we propose a simple version of boundary distance maps
called rectified RW maps that, as we demonstrate in our experiments, achieve
state-of-the-art performance with similar or better Dice coefficients and
Hausdorff distances than Dice, Focal, and Boundary losses in three distinct
segmentation tasks. We quantify the optimization instability provided by
Boundary loss distance maps, and we empirically show that our rectified RW maps
are stable to optimize. The code to run all our experiments is publicly
available at: https://github.com/jmlipman/RegionWiseLoss.]]></summary>

amount of work. Typically, this task involves synthesis, coloring, and
placement of 3D models within the game scene. To lessen this workload, we can
apply machine learning to automate some aspects of the game scene development.
Earlier research has already tackled automated generation of the game scene
background with machine learning. However, model auto-coloring remains an
underexplored problem. The automatic coloring of a 3D model is a challenging
task, especially when dealing with the digital representation of a colorful,
multipart object. In such a case, we have to ``understand'' the object's
composition and coloring scheme of each part. Existing single-stage methods
have their own caveats such as the need for segmentation of the object or
generating individual parts that have to be assembled together to yield the
final model. We address these limitations by proposing a two-stage training
approach to synthesize auto-colored 3D models. In the first stage, we obtain a
3D point cloud representing a 3D object, whilst in the second stage, we assign
colors to points within such cloud. Next, by leveraging the so-called
triangulation trick, we generate a 3D mesh in which the surfaces are colored
based on interpolation of colored points representing vertices of a given mesh
triangle. This approach allows us to generate a smooth coloring scheme.
Experimental evaluation shows that our two-stage approach gives better results
in terms of shape reconstruction and coloring when compared to traditional
single-stage techniques.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vision transformers have recently received explosive popularity, but huge
computational cost is still a severe issue. Recent efficient designs for vision
transformers follow two pipelines, namely, structural compression based on
local spatial prior and non-structural token pruning. However, rough token
pruning breaks the spatial structure that is indispensable for local spatial
prior. To take advantage of both two pipelines, this work seeks to dynamically
identify uninformative tokens for each instance and trim down both the training
and inference complexity while maintain complete spatial structure and
information flow. To achieve this goal, we propose Evo-ViT, a self-motivated
slow-fast token evolution method for vision transformers. Specifically, we
conduct unstructured instance-wise token selection by taking advantage of the
global class attention that is unique to vision transformers. Then, we propose
to update information tokens and placeholder tokens that contribute little to
the final prediction with different computational properties, namely, slow-fast
updating. Thanks to the slow-fast updating mechanism that guarantees
information flow and spatial structure, our Evo-ViT can accelerate vanilla
transformers of both flat and deep-narrow structures from the very beginning of
the training process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
can significantly reduce the computational costs of vision transformers while
maintaining comparable performance on image classification. For example, our
method accelerates DeiT-S by over 60% throughput while only sacrificing 0.4%
top-1 accuracy.]]></summary>

years, and majority of the established technologies are based on supervised
models. In recent years, image-level weakly supervised semantic segmentation
(WSSS), including single- and multi-stage process, has attracted large
attention due to data labeling efficiency. In this paper, we propose to embed
affinity learning of multi-stage approaches in a single-stage model. To be
specific, we introduce an adaptive affinity loss to thoroughly learn the local
pairwise affinity. As such, a deep neural network is used to deliver
comprehensive semantic information in the training phase, whilst improving the
performance of the final prediction module. On the other hand, considering the
existence of errors in the pseudo labels, we propose a novel label reassign
loss to mitigate over-fitting. Extensive experiments are conducted on the
PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach
that outperforms other standard single-stage methods and achieves comparable

a GAN inversion model to convert the images back to the GAN latent space and
obtain the inverted latent codes for each image, where we introduce the
cycle-consistency training to learn more robust and consistent inverted latent
codes. We further uncover the latent space semantics of the trained GAN model,
by learning a similarity model between text representations and the latent
codes. In the text-guided optimization module, we generate images with the
desired semantic attributes by optimizing the inverted latent codes. Extensive

samples that are misclassified for similar reasons. Based on our parameter

images, but in reality, most face images are captured under unconstrained or
poor conditions, e.g., by video surveillance. Existing methods are featured by
learning data uncertainty to avoid overfitting the noise, or by adding margins
to the angle or cosine space of the normalized softmax loss to penalize the
target logit, which enforces intra-class compactness and inter-class
discrepancy. In this paper, we propose a deep Rival Penalized Competitive
Learning (RPCL) for deep face recognition in low-resolution (LR) images.
Inspired by the idea of the RPCL, our method further enforces regulation on the
rival logit, which is defined as the largest non-target logit for an input
image. Different from existing methods that only consider penalization on the
target logit, our method not only strengthens the learning towards the target
label, but also enforces a reverse direction, i.e., becoming de-learning, away
from the rival label. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method
improves the existing state-of-the-art methods to be very robust for LR face
recognition.]]></summary>

However, they mirror strong location preference in datasets, which we call
spatial bias. Therefore, generators render poor samples at unseen locations and
scales. We argue that the generators rely on their implicit positional encoding
to render spatial content. From our observations, the generator's implicit
positional encoding is translation-variant, making the generator spatially
biased. To address this issue, we propose injecting explicit positional
encoding at each scale of the generator. By learning the spatially unbiased
generator, we facilitate the robust use of generators in multiple tasks, such
as GAN inversion, multi-scale generation, generation of arbitrary sizes and
aspect ratios. Furthermore, we show that our method can also be applied to
denoising diffusion probabilistic models.]]></summary>

autonomous driving, human-robot interaction), which aims to predict future
motion sequences given a set of historical observations. However, the observed
elements may be of different levels of importance. Some information may be
irrelevant or even distracting to the forecasting in certain situations. To
address this issue, we propose a generic motion forecasting framework (named
RAIN) with dynamic key information selection and ranking based on a hybrid
attention mechanism. The general framework is instantiated to handle
multi-agent trajectory prediction and human motion forecasting tasks,
respectively. In the former task, the model learns to recognize the relations
between agents with a graph representation and to determine their relative
significance. In the latter task, the model learns to capture the temporal
proximity and dependency in long-term human motions. We also propose an
effective double-stage training pipeline with an alternating training strategy
to optimize the parameters in different modules of the framework. We validate
the framework on both synthetic simulations and motion forecasting benchmarks
in different domains, demonstrating that our method not only achieves
state-of-the-art forecasting performance, but also provides interpretable and
reasonable hybrid attention weights.]]></summary>

scribble-level annotation. The regularized loss has been proven to be an
effective solution for this task. However, most existing regularized losses
only leverage static shallow features (color, spatial information) to compute
the regularized kernel, which limits its final performance since such static
shallow features fail to describe pair-wise pixel relationship in complicated
cases. In this paper, we propose a new regularized loss which utilizes both
shallow and deep features that are dynamically updated in order to aggregate
sufficient information to represent the relationship of different pixels.
Moreover, in order to provide accurate deep features, we adopt vision
transformer as the backbone and design a feature consistency head to train the
pair-wise feature relationship. Unlike most approaches that adopt multi-stage
training strategy with many bells and whistles, our approach can be directly
trained in an end-to-end manner, in which the feature consistency head and our
regularized loss can benefit from each other. Extensive experiments show that
our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performances, outperforming other
approaches by a significant margin with more than 6\% mIoU increase.]]></summary>

quick estimate of future state uncertainty considered in the SMPC finite-time

simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms. When two or more robots are
in communication range, these uncertainties are then updated using a
distributed Kalman filtering approach. Lastly, a Deep Q-learning agent is
employed to serve as a high-level path planner, providing the SMPC with target
positions that move the robots towards a desired global goal. Our complete

challenges for existing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
approaches. To deal with dynamic environments, computer vision researchers
usually apply some learning-based object detectors to remove these dynamic
objects. However, these object detectors are computationally too expensive for
mobile robot on-board processing. In practical applications, these objects
output noisy sounds that can be effectively detected by on-board sound source
localization. The directional information of the sound source object can be
efficiently obtained by direction of sound arrival (DoA) estimation, but depth
estimation is difficult. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel
audio-visual fusion approach that fuses sound source direction into the RGB-D
image and thus removes the effect of dynamic obstacles on the multi-robot SLAM
system. Experimental results of multi-robot SLAM in different dynamic
environments show that the proposed method uses very small computational
resources to obtain very stable self-localization results.]]></summary>

with different resources, where the resource constraint and task of interest
corresponding to a group of classes are dynamically specified at testing time.
Previous NAS approaches seek to design architectures for all classes
simultaneously, which may not be optimal for some individual tasks. A
straightforward solution is to search an architecture from scratch for each
deployment scenario, which however is computation-intensive and impractical. To
address this, we present a novel and general framework, called Elastic
Architecture Search (EAS), permitting instant specializations at runtime for
diverse tasks with various resource constraints. To this end, we first propose
to effectively train the over-parameterized network via a task dropout strategy
to disentangle the tasks during training. In this way, the resulting model is
robust to the subsequent task dropping at inference time. Based on the
well-trained over-parameterized network, we then propose an efficient
architecture generator to obtain optimal architectures within a single forward
pass. Experiments on two image classification datasets show that EAS is able to
find more compact networks with better performance while remarkably being
orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art NAS methods. For example, our
proposed EAS finds compact architectures within 0.1 second for 50 deployment

varying time steps, we compute both short-range scene flow to impose local

multi-view consistency constraints with wide baselines. We demonstrate accurate

Given the trajectories of neuronal fiber pathways, we model the evolution of

as a parameter to control the granularity of the model that allows local or

has led to great success using a massive number of parameters. However, due to
deployment constraints in edge devices, there has been a rising interest in the
compression of these models to improve their inference time and memory
footprint. This paper presents a novel loss objective to compress token
embeddings in the Transformer-based models by leveraging an AutoEncoder
architecture. More specifically, we emphasize the importance of the direction
of compressed embeddings with respect to original uncompressed embeddings. The
proposed method is task-agnostic and does not require further language modeling
pre-training. Our method significantly outperforms the commonly used SVD-based
matrix-factorization approach in terms of initial language model Perplexity.
Moreover, we evaluate our proposed approach over SQuAD v1.1 dataset and several
downstream tasks from the GLUE benchmark, where we also outperform the baseline
in most scenarios. Our code is public.]]></summary>

effortlessly find the objects of the same category in another image and
precisely tell their visual boundaries. Such visual cognition capability of
humans seems absent from the current research spectrum of computer vision.
Existing segmentation networks, for example, rely on a humongous amount of
labeled data, which is laborious and costly to collect and annotate; besides,
the performance of segmentation networks tend to downgrade as the number of the
category increases. In this paper, we introduce a novel Reference semantic
segmentation Network (Ref-Net) to conduct visual boundary knowledge
translation. Ref-Net contains a Reference Segmentation Module (RSM) and a
Boundary Knowledge Translation Module (BKTM). Inspired by the human recognition
mechanism, RSM is devised only to segment the same category objects based on
the features of the reference objects. BKTM, on the other hand, introduces two
boundary discriminator branches to conduct inner and outer boundary
segmentation of the target objectin an adversarial manner, and translate the
annotated boundary knowledge of open-source datasets into the segmentation
network. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that, with tens of finely-grained
annotated samples as guidance, Ref-Net achieves results on par with fully
supervised methods on six datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to effectively incorporate cross-utterance information cues into a neural
language model (LM) has emerged as one of the intriguing issues for automatic
speech recognition (ASR). Existing research efforts on improving
contextualization of an LM typically regard previous utterances as a sequence
of additional input and may fail to capture complex global structural
dependencies among these utterances. In view of this, we in this paper seek to
represent the historical context information of an utterance as
graph-structured data so as to distill cross-utterances, global word
interaction relationships. To this end, we apply a graph convolutional network
(GCN) on the resulting graph to obtain the corresponding GCN embeddings of
historical words. GCN has recently found its versatile applications on
social-network analysis, text summarization, and among others due mainly to its
ability of effectively capturing rich relational information among elements.
However, GCN remains largely underexplored in the context of ASR, especially
for dealing with conversational speech. In addition, we frame ASR N-best
reranking as a prediction problem, leveraging bidirectional encoder
representations from transformers (BERT) as the vehicle to not only seize the
local intrinsic word regularity patterns inherent in a candidate hypothesis but
also incorporate the cross-utterance, historical word interaction cues
distilled by GCN for promoting performance. Extensive experiments conducted on
the AMI benchmark dataset seem to confirm the pragmatic utility of our methods,
in relation to some current top-of-the-line methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Controlling the style of natural language by disentangling the latent space
is an important step towards interpretable machine learning. After the latent
space is disentangled, the style of a sentence can be transformed by tuning the
style representation without affecting other features of the sentence. Previous
works usually use adversarial training to guarantee that disentangled vectors
do not affect each other. However, adversarial methods are difficult to train.
Especially when there are multiple features (e.g., sentiment, or tense, which
we call style types in this paper), each feature requires a separate
discriminator for extracting a disentangled style vector corresponding to that
feature. In this paper, we propose a unified distribution-controlling method,
which provides each specific style value (the value of style types, e.g.,
positive sentiment, or past tense) with a unique representation. This method
contributes a solid theoretical basis to avoid adversarial training in
multi-type disentanglement. We also propose multiple loss functions to achieve
a style-content disentanglement as well as a disentanglement among multiple
style types. In addition, we observe that if two different style types always
have some specific style values that occur together in the dataset, they will
affect each other when transferring the style values. We call this phenomenon
training bias, and we propose a loss function to alleviate such training bias
while disentangling multiple types. We conduct experiments on two datasets
(Yelp service reviews and Amazon product reviews) to evaluate the
style-disentangling effect and the unsupervised style transfer performance on
two style types: sentiment and tense. The experimental results show the
effectiveness of our model.]]></summary>

With the greedy strategy, GGE forces the biased models to over-fit the biased

cognition, require reasoning about what might have happened at time t, while
conditioning on multiple contexts from the relative past and future. However,
simultaneous incorporation of past and future contexts using generative
language models (LMs) can be challenging, as they are trained either to
condition only on the past context or to perform narrowly scoped
text-infilling. In this paper, we propose DeLorean, a new unsupervised decoding
algorithm that can flexibly incorporate both the past and future contexts using
only off-the-shelf, left-to-right language models and no supervision. The key
intuition of our algorithm is incorporating the future through
back-propagation, during which, we only update the internal representation of
the output while fixing the model parameters. By alternating between forward
and backward propagation, DeLorean can decode the output representation that
reflects both the left and right contexts. We demonstrate that our approach is
general and applicable to two nonmonotonic reasoning tasks: abductive text
generation and counterfactual story revision, where DeLorean outperforms a
range of unsupervised and some supervised methods, based on automatic and human

photo according to the dialogue context. In addition, for both tasks, we
provide baseline models using the state-of-the-art models and report their
benchmark performances. The best image retrieval model achieves 10.4% recall@1

generate the responses which are of good quality, but it should also generate
the responses which can lead to long-term success of the dialogue. Although,
the current approaches improved the response quality, but they over-look the
training signals present in the dialogue data. We can leverage these signals to
generate the weakly supervised training data for learning dialog policy and
reward estimator, and make the policy take actions (generates responses) which
can foresee the future direction for a successful (rewarding) conversation. We
simulate the dialogue between an agent and a user (modelled similar to an agent
with supervised learning objective) to interact with each other. The agent uses
dynamic blocking to generate ranked diverse responses and
exploration-exploitation to select among the Top-K responses. Each simulated
state-action pair is evaluated (works as a weak annotation) with three quality
modules: Semantic Relevant, Semantic Coherence and Consistent Flow. Empirical
studies with two benchmarks indicate that our model can significantly
out-perform the response quality and lead to a successful conversation on both
automatic evaluation and human judgement.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiple parallel attention mechanisms that use multiple attention heads
facilitate greater performance of the Transformer model for various
applications e.g., Neural Machine Translation (NMT), text classification. In
multi-head attention mechanism, different heads attend to different parts of
the input. However, the limitation is that multiple heads might attend to the
same part of the input, resulting in multiple heads being redundant. Thus, the
model resources are under-utilized. One approach to avoid this is to prune
least important heads based on certain importance score. In this work, we focus
on designing a Dynamic Head Importance Computation Mechanism (DHICM) to
dynamically calculate the importance of a head with respect to the input. Our
insight is to design an additional attention layer together with multi-head
attention, and utilize the outputs of the multi-head attention along with the
input, to compute the importance for each head. Additionally, we add an extra
loss function to prevent the model from assigning same score to all heads, to
identify more important heads and improvise performance. We analyzed
performance of DHICM for NMT with different languages. Experiments on different
datasets show that DHICM outperforms traditional Transformer-based approach by
large margin, especially, when less training data is available.]]></summary>

gained popularity due to its importance in dialogue understanding, including in
multimodal settings (i.e., text, acoustics, and visual). The few existing

labels and encompasses acoustic, visual, and textual modalities. We propose
several strong multimodal baselines and show the importance of contextual and
multimodal information for humor recognition in conversations. The empirical
results on M2H2 dataset demonstrate that multimodal information complements
unimodal information for humor recognition. The dataset and the baselines are

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The role of predicting sarcasm in the text is known as automatic sarcasm
detection. Given the prevalence and challenges of sarcasm in sentiment-bearing
text, this is a critical phase in most sentiment analysis tasks. With the
increasing popularity and usage of different social media platforms among users
around the world, people are using sarcasm more and more in their day-to-day
conversations, social media posts and tweets, and it is considered as a way for
people to express their sentiment about some certain topics or issues. As a
result of the increasing popularity, researchers started to focus their
research endeavors on detecting sarcasm from a text in different languages
especially the English language. However, the task of sarcasm detection is a
challenging task due to the nature of sarcastic texts; which can be relative
and significantly differs from one person to another depending on the topic,
region, the user's mentality and other factors. In addition to these
challenges, sarcasm detection in the Arabic language has its own challenges due
to the complexity of the Arabic language, such as being morphologically rich,
with many dialects that significantly vary between each other, while also being
lowly resourced. In recent years, only few research attempts started tackling
the task of sarcasm detection in Arabic, including creating and collecting
corpora, organizing workshops and establishing baseline models. This paper
intends to create a new humanly annotated Arabic corpus for sarcasm detection
collected from tweets, and implementing a new approach for sarcasm detection
and quantification in Arabic tweets. The annotation technique followed in this
paper is unique in sarcasm detection and the proposed approach tackles the
problem as a regression problem instead of classification; i.e., the model
attempts to predict the level of sarcasm instead of binary classification.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recognition errors are common in human communication. Similar errors often
lead to unwanted behaviour in dialogue systems or virtual assistants. In human
communication, we can recover from them by repeating misrecognized words or
phrases; however in human-machine communication this recovery mechanism is not
available. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap and present a system
that allows a user to correct speech recognition errors in a virtual assistant
by repeating misunderstood words. When a user repeats part of the phrase the
system rewrites the original query to incorporate the correction. This rewrite
allows the virtual assistant to understand the original query successfully. We
present an end-to-end 2-step attention pointer network that can generate the
the rewritten query by merging together the incorrectly understood utterance
with the correction follow-up. We evaluate the model on data collected for this

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In order to evaluate the performance of the attention based neural ASR under
noisy conditions, the current trend is to present hours of various noisy speech
data to the model and measure the overall word/phoneme error rate (W/PER). In
general, it is unclear how these models perform when exposed to a cocktail
party setup in which two or more speakers are active. In this paper, we present
the mixtures of speech signals to a popular attention-based neural ASR, known
as Listen, Attend, and Spell (LAS), at different target-to-interference ratio
(TIR) and measure the phoneme error rate. In particular, we investigate in
details when two phonemes are mixed what will be the predicted phoneme; in this
fashion we build a model in which the most probable predictions for a phoneme
are given. We found a 65% relative increase in PER when LAS was presented with
mixed speech signals at TIR = 0 dB and the performance approaches the unmixed
scenario at TIR = 30 dB. Our results show the model, when presented with mixed
phonemes signals, tend to predict those that have higher accuracies during
evaluation of original phoneme signals.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soft spelling errors are a class of spelling mistakes that is widespread
among native Arabic speakers and foreign learners alike. Some of these errors
are typographical in nature. They occur due to orthographic variations of some
Arabic letters and the complex rules that dictate their correct usage. Many
people forgo these rules, and given the identical phonetic sounds, they often
confuse such letters. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional long short-term
memory network that corrects this class of errors. We develop, train, evaluate,
and compare a set of BiLSTM networks. We approach the spelling correction
problem at the character level. We handle Arabic texts from both classical and
modern standard Arabic. We treat the problem as a one-to-one sequence
transcription problem. Since the soft Arabic errors class encompasses omission
and addition mistakes, to preserve the one-to-one sequence transcription, we
propose a simple low-resource yet effective technique that maintains the
one-to-one sequencing and avoids using a costly encoder-decoder architecture.
We train the BiLSTM models to correct the spelling mistakes using transformed
input and stochastic error injection approaches. We recommend a configuration
that has two BiLSTM layers, uses the dropout regularization, and is trained
using the latter training approach with error injection rate of 40%. The best
model corrects 96.4% of the injected errors and achieves a low character error
rate of 1.28% on a real test set of soft spelling mistakes.]]></summary>

time, further adoption in some domains is hindered by inability to fully trust
an AI system that it will not harm a human. Besides the concerns for fairness,
privacy, transparency, and explainability are key to developing trusts in AI
systems. As stated in describing trustworthy AI "Trust comes through
understanding. How AI-led decisions are made and what determining factors were
included are crucial to understand." The subarea of explaining AI systems has
come to be known as XAI. Multiple aspects of an AI system can be explained;
these include biases that the data might have, lack of data points in a
particular region of the example space, fairness of gathering the data, feature
importances, etc. However, besides these, it is critical to have human-centered
explanations that are directly related to decision-making similar to how a
domain expert makes decisions based on "domain knowledge," that also include
well-established, peer-validated explicit guidelines. To understand and
validate an AI system's outcomes (such as classification, recommendations,
predictions), that lead to developing trust in the AI system, it is necessary
to involve explicit domain knowledge that humans understand and use.]]></summary>

been playing an important role in many e-commerce applications. As the
information being searched over the internet is rapidly increasing, users often
face the difficulty of finding items of his/her own interest and RS often
provides help in such tasks. Recent studies show that, as the item space
increases, and the number of items rated by the users become very less, issues
like sparsity arise. To mitigate the sparsity problem, transfer learning
techniques are being used wherein the data from dense domain(source) is
considered in order to predict the missing entries in the sparse
domain(target). In this paper, we propose a transfer learning approach for
cross-domain recommendation when both domains have no overlap of users and
items. In our approach the transferring of knowledge from source to target
domain is done in a novel way. We make use of co-clustering technique to obtain
the codebook (cluster-level rating pattern) of source domain. By making use of
hinge loss function we transfer the learnt codebook of the source domain to
target. The use of hinge loss as a loss function is novel and has not been
tried before in transfer learning. We demonstrate that our technique improves
the approximation of the target matrix on benchmark datasets.]]></summary>

different Internet platforms has intensified the need for a background music
(BGM) retrieval system. However, existing video-music retrieval methods only
based on the visual modality cannot show promising performance regarding videos
with fine-grained virtual contents. In this paper, we also investigate the
widely added voice-overs in short videos and propose a novel framework to

self-attention (SA) and the cross-modal attention (CMA) modules to explore the
intra- and the inter-relationships of different modalities respectively. For
balancing the modalities, we dynamically assign different weights to the modal
features via a fusion gate. For paring the query and the BGM embeddings, we
introduce a triplet pseudo-label loss to constrain the semantics of the modal
embeddings. As there are no existing virtual-content video-BGM retrieval
datasets, we build and release two virtual-content video datasets HoK400 and
CFM400. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance
and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with large margins.]]></summary>

in order to reduce shopping frictions and increase customer satisfaction. Multi
armed bandit models (MAB) as a type of adaptive optimization algorithms provide
possible approaches for such purposes. In this paper, we analyze using three
classic MAB algorithms, epsilon-greedy, Thompson sampling (TS), and upper
confidence bound 1 (UCB1) for dynamic content recommendations, and walk through
the process of developing these algorithms internally to solve a real world
e-commerce use case. First, we analyze the three MAB algorithms using simulated
purchasing datasets with non-stationary reward distributions to simulate the
possible time-varying customer preferences, where the traffic allocation
dynamics and the accumulative rewards of different algorithms are studied.
Second, we compare the accumulative rewards of the three MAB algorithms with
more than 1,000 trials using actual historical A/B test datasets. We find that
the larger difference between the success rates of competing recommendations
the more accumulative rewards the MAB algorithms can achieve. In addition, we
find that TS shows the highest average accumulative rewards under different
testing scenarios. Third, we develop a batch-updated MAB algorithm to overcome
the delayed reward issue in e-commerce and enable an online content
optimization on our App homepage. For a state-of-the-art comparison, a real A/B
test among our batch-updated MAB algorithm, a third-party MAB solution, and the
default business logic are conducted. The result shows that our batch-updated
MAB algorithm outperforms the counterparts and achieves 6.13% relative
click-through rate (CTR) increase and 16.1% relative conversion rate (CVR)
increase compared to the default experience, and 2.9% relative CTR increase and
1.4% relative CVR increase compared to the external MAB service.]]></summary>

decision-making and recommender systems, such as in predicting potential

designing the special algorithms to perform either link prediction or sign

consisting of network embedding, network feature engineering, and an integrated
classifier, which can perform the link and sign prediction in the same

topological structures and cooperate with the powerful network feature
engineering and integrated classifier can achieve better prediction.
Experiments on several datasets show that the proposed model can achieve
state-of-the-art or competitive performance for both link and sign prediction
in spite of its generality. Interestingly, we find that using only very low

significantly reduce the computational overhead during training and prediction.

alignment. In addition, it (ii) supports annotation rules, i.e., user-provided
mappings that allow for annotating the extracted text based on structural and
semantic information encoded in HTML tags and attributes used for controlling
structure and layout in the original HTML document. These unique features
ensure that downstream knowledge extraction components can operate on accurate

This function is used to learn an optimal policy describing the expert's

through a user interest simulation environment (using RecSim). We simulate
interactions under the aforementioned expert policy for videos recommendation,

main drawback of state-of-the-art recommendation strategies is that a fixed
sequence length of user-item interactions is required as input to train the
models. This might limit the recommendation accuracy, as in practice users
follow different trends on the sequential recommendations. Hence, baseline
strategies might ignore important sequential interactions or add noise to the
models with redundant interactions, depending on the variety of users'
sequential behaviours. To overcome this problem, in this study we propose the
SAR model, which not only learns the sequential patterns but also adjusts the
sequence length of user-item interactions in a personalized manner. We first
design an actor-critic framework, where the RL agent tries to compute the
optimal sequence length as an action, given the user's state representation at
a certain time step. In addition, we optimize a joint loss function to align
the accuracy of the sequential recommendations with the expected cumulative
rewards of the critic network, while at the same time we adapt the sequence
length with the actor network in a personalized manner. Our experimental
evaluation on four real-world datasets demonstrates the superiority of our
proposed model over several baseline approaches. Finally, we make our

multi-document summarization. It not only makes use of the relationships among
the sentences, but also the relationships between the given query and the
sentences. However, the information of original query is often insufficient. So
we present a query expansion method, which is combined in the manifold ranking
to resolve this problem. Our method not only utilizes the information of the
query term itself and the knowledge base WordNet to expand it by synonyms, but
also uses the information of the document set itself to expand the query in
various ways (mean expansion, variance expansion and TextRank expansion).
Compared with the previous query expansion methods, our method combines
multiple query expansion methods to better represent query information, and at
the same time, it makes a useful attempt on manifold ranking. In addition, we
use the degree of word overlap and the proximity between words to calculate the
similarity between sentences. We performed experiments on the datasets of DUC

brain activities. Plenty of works have studied the reading patterns and
attention allocation mechanisms in the reading process. However, little is
known about what happens in human brain during reading comprehension and how we
can utilize this information as implicit feedback to facilitate information
acquisition performance. With the advances in brain imaging techniques such as
EEG, it is possible to collect high-precision brain signals in almost real
time. With neuroimaging techniques, we carefully design a lab-based user study
to investigate brain activities during reading comprehension. Our findings show
that neural responses vary with different types of contents, i.e., contents
that can satisfy users' information needs and contents that cannot. We suggest
that various cognitive activities, e.g., cognitive loading, semantic-thematic
understanding, and inferential processing, at the micro-time scale during
reading comprehension underpin these neural responses. Inspired by these
detectable differences in cognitive activities, we construct supervised
learning models based on EEG features for two reading comprehension tasks:
answer sentence classification and answer extraction. Results show that it is
feasible to improve their performance with brain signals. These findings imply
that brain signals are valuable feedback for enhancing human-computer

recommender systems. It aims to predict the probability of a user clicking a
particular item given user and item features. As feature interactions bring in
non-linearity, they are widely adopted to improve the performance of CTR
prediction models. Therefore, effectively modelling feature interactions has
attracted much attention in both the research and industry field. The current
approaches can generally be categorized into three classes: (1) na\"ive
methods, which do not model feature interactions and only use original
features; (2) memorized methods, which memorize feature interactions by
explicitly viewing them as new features and assigning trainable embeddings; (3)
factorized methods, which learn latent vectors for original features and
implicitly model feature interactions through factorization functions. Studies
have shown that modelling feature interactions by one of these methods alone
are suboptimal due to the unique characteristics of different feature
interactions. To address this issue, we first propose a general framework
called OptInter which finds the most suitable modelling method for each feature
interaction. Different state-of-the-art deep CTR models can be viewed as
instances of OptInter. To realize the functionality of OptInter, we also
introduce a learning algorithm that automatically searches for the optimal
modelling method. We conduct extensive experiments on four large datasets. Our
experiments show that OptInter improves the best performed state-of-the-art
baseline deep CTR models by up to 2.21%. Compared to the memorized method,
which also outperforms baselines, we reduce up to 91% parameters. In addition,
we conduct several ablation studies to investigate the influence of different
components of OptInter. Finally, we provide interpretable discussions on the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a spur in the medical research literature.
With new research advances in understanding the virus, there is a need for
robust text mining tools which can process, extract and present answers from
the literature in a concise and consumable way. With a DialoGPT based
multi-turn conversation generation module, and BM-25 \& neural embeddings based
ensemble information retrieval module, in this paper we present a
conversational system, which can retrieve and answer coronavirus-related
queries from the rich medical literature, and present it in a conversational
setting with the user. We further perform experiments to compare neural
embedding-based document retrieval and the traditional BM25 retrieval algorithm
and report the results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While there are many music datasets with emotion labels in the literature,
they cannot be used for research on symbolic-domain music analysis or
generation, as there are usually audio files only. In this paper, we present
the EMOPIA (pronounced `yee-m\`{o}-pi-uh') dataset, a shared multi-modal (audio
and MIDI) database focusing on perceived emotion in pop piano music, to
facilitate research on various tasks related to music emotion. The dataset
contains 1,087 music clips from 387 songs and clip-level emotion labels
annotated by four dedicated annotators. Since the clips are not restricted to
one clip per song, they can also be used for song-level analysis. We present
the methodology for building the dataset, covering the song list curation, clip
selection, and emotion annotation processes. Moreover, we prototype use cases
on clip-level music emotion classification and emotion-based symbolic music
generation by training and evaluating corresponding models using the dataset.
The result demonstrates the potential of EMOPIA for being used in future
exploration on piano emotion-related MIR tasks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper investigates a novel approach of digital image watermarking based
on BCH error correction code in Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) domain. In
the proposed technique, the watermark is encoded through BCH error correction
code before embedding process, then it is embedded into the Discrete Cosine
Transformation (DCT) coefficients of cover image. The proposed algorithm also
employs lookup table method to find the best positions in the frequency domains
for watermark insertion. The significant feature of this method is the
reduction of time required in the process embedding of information, security
and ability to correct the error caused by different attacks. Experimental
results show the superiority of the proposed approach against the existing
approaches.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent work has demonstrated the viability of using crowdsourcing as a tool
for evaluating the truthfulness of public statements. Under certain conditions
such as: (1) having a balanced set of workers with different backgrounds and
cognitive abilities; (2) using an adequate set of mechanisms to control the
quality of the collected data; and (3) using a coarse grained assessment scale,
the crowd can provide reliable identification of fake news. However, fake news
are a subtle matter: statements can be just biased ("cherrypicked"), imprecise,
wrong, etc. and the unidimensional truth scale used in existing work cannot
account for such differences. In this paper we propose a multidimensional
notion of truthfulness and we ask the crowd workers to assess seven different
dimensions of truthfulness selected based on existing literature: Correctness,
Neutrality, Comprehensibility, Precision, Completeness, Speaker's
Trustworthiness, and Informativeness. We deploy a set of quality control
mechanisms to ensure that the thousands of assessments collected on 180
publicly available fact-checked statements distributed over two datasets are of
adequate quality, including a custom search engine used by the crowd workers to
find web pages supporting their truthfulness assessments. A comprehensive
analysis of crowdsourced judgments shows that: (1) the crowdsourced assessments
are reliable when compared to an expert-provided gold standard; (2) the
proposed dimensions of truthfulness capture independent pieces of information;
(3) the crowdsourcing task can be easily learned by the workers; and (4) the
resulting assessments provide a useful basis for a more complete estimation of
statement truthfulness.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, the witness of the rapidly growing popularity of short videos on
different Internet platforms has intensified the need for a background music
(BGM) retrieval system. However, existing video-music retrieval methods only
based on the visual modality cannot show promising performance regarding videos
with fine-grained virtual contents. In this paper, we also investigate the
widely added voice-overs in short videos and propose a novel framework to
retrieve BGM for fine-grained short videos. In our framework, we use the
self-attention (SA) and the cross-modal attention (CMA) modules to explore the
intra- and the inter-relationships of different modalities respectively. For
balancing the modalities, we dynamically assign different weights to the modal
features via a fusion gate. For paring the query and the BGM embeddings, we
introduce a triplet pseudo-label loss to constrain the semantics of the modal
embeddings. As there are no existing virtual-content video-BGM retrieval
datasets, we build and release two virtual-content video datasets HoK400 and
CFM400. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance
and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with large margins.]]></summary>
